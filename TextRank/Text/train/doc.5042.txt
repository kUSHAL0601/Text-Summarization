@entity0 -- she was remembered in her last @entity3 16 years ago -- a near lifetime in an athlete 's career -- as a diminutive figure whose size belied her big ambitions and ability to win @entity3 gold
@entity13 , at 5 - foot - 6 and 108 pounds , is now 40 years old , and just as @entity14 made an extraordinary comeback at age 41 to be the oldest swimmer in the @entity18 , @entity12 is now seeking her own @entity19
@entity12 has qualified to participate in late june 's trials to make the @entity21 , and if she makes the cut , she will go on to compete in the @entity23 in july
when she retired following her last olympics in 1996 , she was considered one of the greatest distance freestyle swimmers of all time , winning four gold medals
in all , she competed in three @entity29 -- @entity30 in 1988 , @entity31 in 1992 and @entity32 in 1996
she was known for her " unorthodox windmill " stroke , as she puts it
now the olympian who began swimming at age 2 and competing at age 4 is seeking her fourth games over a 24 - year period
can she conquer the biggest adversary of all -- aging ? in a recent interview with @entity1 at her @entity44 , @entity45 , training facility about 35 miles southeast of downtown @entity0 , @entity12 said she has been working out five hours a day -- with her husband spending more time taking care of their two small children
but she still drops the kids off at day care with her hair wet and puts dinner on the table every night , she says
" this time has been so much more fulfilling , " she said of her latest @entity3 attempt
she has spent the past 16 years as an author , reality tv personality and a motivational speaker
" of course , the competitor in me wants to make the @entity3 team , but i also feel like if i do n't , it 's been an amazing journey , " @entity12 added
her return to long hours in the pool has agreed with her
she swims 10 miles daily , plus 45 - minute workouts in the weight room
" it did n't take me as long as i thought to get into a groove , " she said
" my family really supported me
my husband said he would be home to take care of the kids , and so i found a routine
" the @entity75 , @entity45 , resident expects supporters in her quest to make the 2012 @entity3 team , but she also expects her share of skeptics
" the hardest part of this comeback was n't physical and was n't scheduling , " @entity12 said
" it was the critics
and i knew there would be critics out there , and i always had critics in my career
" those critics will say things like " you know , she 's 40
what is she thinking ? she already had this success
leave it for someone else now
you 've had your time , " @entity12 said
she has a simple answer to those critics
" well , if i swim fast enough , who says it 's not my time
" @entity12 says she 's proud of the fact " that at 40 , i can come back and actually swim with 17 - year - olds and keep up with them
" but she admits to having an occasional bad night of sleep because her daughter or son is up at night
her trainer , @entity114 , said returning to swimming shape was n't easy for @entity12
" i think for her at 40 , the physical is the more difficult
you know she was always in good shape
but it was getting back into swimming shape
her mental attitude has not changed
not a bit , " he told @entity1
" predictions in swimming are difficult , but i think @entity13 is going to amaze everybody with how fast she can swim , " @entity114 added
@entity12 ' husband , @entity130 , said his admiration for his wife has grown
" i understand why 20 - year - olds do this , because i think when you are not in the pool training , you are resting , right , " he said
" and for @entity137 at 40 with two kids and working and a mom , she does n't get as much rest as she would probably like , and i respect that even more
" @entity1 's @entity141 contributed to this report .
