@entity0 , @entity1 -- actor @entity4 was the " poster child " for the problem of addicts " doctor shopping " for dangerous drugs , @entity1 's top law enforcement official said tuesday
investigators found that the former child actor was supplied with prescriptions for five controlled substances by seven doctors in the last 10 weeks of his life , attorney general @entity9 said
" @entity4 actually obtained 553 dangerous drugs in just this year , as late as five days before he died , " @entity9 told reporters at a news conference in @entity0
the drugs included @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity9 said
the coroner has not yet ruled on what killed @entity4 , 38 , who died last month after collapsing at the @entity0 apartment he shared with his mother
toxicology lab results are expected to be available this month for @entity4 , who battled drug addiction for decades
@entity4 visited several emergency rooms and urgent care clinics with complaints of an injured shoulder or depression issues , according to @entity36 , head of the state task force investigating doctor shopping
@entity40 deputy coroner @entity39 revealed last month that @entity4 obtained drugs using prescriptions written under the names of 20 @entity0 doctors in the past year
the coroner subpoenaed medical records from those doctors
@entity4 also obtained at least one prescription of @entity23 through the use of an illegally obtained prescription pad , @entity9 said
state agents arrested one person last month in connection with what @entity9 said was a massive drug ring that obtained and sold the counterfeit doctor 's pads
although @entity4 battled drug addiction for decades , his manager said his death came when @entity4 " was making major progress " with a program to wean him from pills
still , @entity4 sometimes threatened to find other doctors to prescribe him drugs when his primary physician would n't give him what he wanted , manager @entity64 said monday
" i would be the only one who could talk him out of it , " @entity64 said monday night
his doctor was providing pills only in one - day supplies in an effort to wean him , @entity64 said
@entity4 's primary care doctor would constantly follow up with urgent care centers that he believed were writing prescriptions for @entity4 , @entity64 said
the doctor later gave the information to investigators , he said
@entity36 confirmed to @entity2 that @entity4 's doctor was helping investigators
@entity4 had a prescription for the muscle relaxer @entity22 and the narcotic pain reliever @entity20 filled at a pharmacy february 26 , a source with knowledge of the transaction told @entity2
two days after @entity4 picked up the drugs , his primary care doctor called the @entity95 pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions , the source said
an autopsy revealed that @entity4 suffered from pneumonia , an enlarged heart and water in his lungs when he collapsed march 10 , @entity39 said
@entity64 said he and @entity4 's family are convinced his death was not from a drug overdose , but was perhaps a bad reaction to a single pill he took in the hours before his death
the pills , prescribed by an addiction specialist , came with a warning that they should not be taken by someone with a heart condition or flulike symptoms , both of which @entity4 had , @entity64 said
" this kid was making major progress , " @entity64 said
his manager said that if @entity4 was cheating on his addiction program , he would probably not have admitted it to him since he would have dropped @entity121 as a client
@entity4 began his acting career in 1982 , with his first television appearance on the @entity126 series " the @entity127
" his first film role was in the 1984 @entity130 movie " @entity131
" @entity4 also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film " @entity135
" film critic @entity136 said of him at the time , " if he continues to act this well , he will never become a half - forgotten child star , but will continue to grow into an important actor
" his most famous role was in the 1987 movie " @entity144 , " in which @entity4 played a fresh - faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire
in recent years , the actor was reunited with longtime friend and frequent co-star @entity150 in a reality show
" @entity155 " ran for two seasons on the @entity153 before it was canceled .
