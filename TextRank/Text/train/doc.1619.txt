a moment of truth approaches for president @entity3 's signature health care reforms with saturday 's self - imposed deadline to get the website to work properly for most users
@entity3 and officials in charge of @entity9 say the " vast majority " of people who go to the website to sign up at the end of the month will have a much improved experience than the crashes , error messages and delays users faced when it launched october 1
however , problems continue to plague the system , and technology experts question if the fixes being deployed by a team of government workers , outside contractors and specialists can get it functioning smoothly as soon as saturday
@entity27 , president of @entity30 - based software developer @entity28 , called the administration 's prediction that @entity9 would work at 80 % capacity on or around november 30 an impractical threshold in the software world
" i do n't know how to build something that 's only 80 % complete , " @entity27 told @entity36
" i do n't even understand how that works
" the website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system , and opened the reforms known as @entity45 to fresh attacks by conservative republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them
more bad news emerged wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year
@entity53 : enroll in @entity45 , but not too fast small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as @entity57 , but problems with @entity9 have prevented their online enrollment so far
it was the third delay of the @entity62 component of the website , this time until november 2014
for now , " small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a shop plan through an insurer , agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll , " said @entity64 , a spokeswoman for the @entity65 that oversees the rollout of the reforms
the @entity76 does n't require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers , though workers are required to have coverage
employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs
" we expect that making direct enrollment , tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50 % of employee premiums in 2014 , " @entity64 said
however , the head of the @entity98 complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll
" with this delay , it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied , " said @entity104 , the group 's president and ceo
" not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing , cumbersome and time - consuming for employers
" republicans pounced on the news , with @entity53 speaker @entity116 urging @entity3 to delay implementation of the entire @entity76
" this law has been an absolute disaster , leaving us to ask , ' what 's next ? ' " the @entity119 @entity118 said in a statement
" if the president wo n't repeal it , he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on @entity131 families and small businesses as well as our economy
" @entity116 signs up for @entity45 meanwhile , insurance industry insiders told @entity36 on condition of not being identified that problems continue with the transmission of data submitted by people signing up for coverage through @entity9
" there 's no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now , " an industry official said , referring to the november 30 date for the site to run smoothly for most users
@entity148 , a spokesman for the insurance trade group @entity149 , said that " there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately
" insurers : despite deadline , @entity45 glitches persist wednesday 's developments came as the @entity3 administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment over the weekend
according to a @entity53 official , the administration suggested this week that allied organizations hold off on launching campaigns to drive traffic to the website in the first week of december
officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site ca n't handle , which is what occurred around its launch in october
@entity9 was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users , and will reach that capacity by saturday , the @entity53 official said
however , big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on october 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return , the official noted
publicly , @entity3 and @entity182 secretary @entity181 have been urging @entity131 to give @entity9 another try , though they make clear it remains a work in progress
the november 30 target for website improvements " does not represent a relaunch of @entity9 ; it is not a magical date , " @entity64 told reporters
" there will be times after november 30 when @entity9 does not function properly
" website woes aside , a new @entity36 / @entity194 poll released wednesday showed a majority of @entity131 believe the current @entity45 problems can be solved , and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago
in a conference call tuesday with state and local officials , @entity181 listed steps taken so far to improve the website 's performance
" we 've added hardware , we 've added software ; we 're continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people , " she said , urging the officials " to not hesitate to recommend that people go to @entity9 and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better
" @entity181 : @entity45 website improvements ' on track ' a properly functioning website is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the @entity76 that require people to have health coverage
the failure of @entity9 to enable people to enroll when the sign - up period began last month undermined the launch of new health insurance exchanges intended to provide affordable coverage for millions who previously were uninsured or under - insured
in theory , the exchanges create large pools of customers that include generally healthier and less - costly younger people as well as older folks who tend to require more expensive health care
such large markets would hold down prices by allowing insurance companies to offset the higher costs of aging consumers with the money from lower - cost policy holders , the thinking goes
for the program to work , it needs to sign up younger people less inclined to pay for health coverage they do n't believe they need
the @entity118 opposition targets the entire health care law , not just the website woes , as the ultimate example of big government run amok
enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new insurance exchanges were much lower than initially expected
now some states have reported stronger numbers
according to a @entity36 count based on available figures , a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under @entity45 -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the @entity264
in addition , more than 370,000 have signed up for @entity266 under state programs expanded through the health care reforms , the @entity36 count shows
the enrollment period runs until march 31 , and officials have said the target for the first year was 7 million people
to ensure they have coverage starting on january 1 , consumers must sign up by december 23 , the administration recently announced
@entity27 , the software expert , cited december 23 as the most significant deadline , noting that demand would be huge because people by nature wait until the last minute
success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system , @entity27 said , comparing it to a highway on which 50,000 people traveling 60 mph is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 mph is a jam
also wednesday , seven @entity294 senators , including some up for re-election next year , asked @entity3 to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems
@entity181 is technically the top administration official in the implementation of @entity45 , but former @entity53 aide @entity301 was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the site
@entity304 will become a top economic adviser to @entity3 in january
in a letter , sens. @entity306 of @entity307 , @entity308 of @entity309 , @entity310 of @entity30 , @entity311 of @entity312 , @entity313 of @entity314 , @entity315 of @entity316 and @entity317 of @entity30 called for @entity3 to name a successor to @entity301
separately , an @entity182 official confirmed the government will go with a new web - hosting contractor , @entity323 , for @entity9 early next year
the current contract with @entity325 ends in march
the official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made months before any problems with @entity9 were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late october , which the administration blamed on the @entity335 subsidiary
the @entity323 contract was signed in july
