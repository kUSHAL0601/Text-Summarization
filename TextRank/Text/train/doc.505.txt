@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has n't seen her father since he left @entity1 on a raft but is hoping the loosening of travel restrictions might help bring that reunion closer to taking place
" i have n't seen my father since 1994
it would change my life to be able to see him and give him a hug , " @entity3 said
on monday , @entity1 will no longer need an exit permit and a letter of invitation from someone in another country to travel abroad
shortly after @entity22 took power in 1959 , stringent travel laws were put in place to stem an exodus from @entity1
now @entity1 will require only a passport to travel internationally and can stay abroad for two years -- more than twice as long as the previous restriction -- without losing their property or ability to return to the island
doctors and other professionals who the government said owed @entity1 society for their training will also be able to take advantage of the looser restrictions
also for the first time , @entity1 will be able to travel abroad with their young children
but officials have said military officials , who might possess government secrets , and sports stars , who could earn a fortune overseas compared with their salaries in @entity1 , will still face added restrictions
it was unclear whether members of dissident organizations , long prevented from receiving honors and awards abroad , would also be able to travel with greater freedom
" if you remove the exit permit but you require @entity1 citizens to revalidate their passports , the question is : will everyone get a passport back and therefore be free to travel , or will there still be controls ? " @entity64 assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs @entity62 said in october after the new travel policies were announced
on friday , a @entity67 spokeswoman said in a statement that the @entity64 was working to address any increase in the number of @entity1 seeking visas to come to the @entity64
@entity64 officials have said that at least for the time being , the @entity73 , or " wet foot , dry foot , " will remain in place
the act allows @entity1 who arrive on @entity64 soil to remain in the country
with the loosening of travel restrictions , @entity1 officials again called for an end to the policy
waiting in a line to apply for a passport , @entity3 said she hoped that she would soon be able to travel abroad and be reunited with her family
but she conceded she still needed to find a country that would give her a visa and be able to pay for a plane ticket
still , @entity3 said , she dreamed of seeing the world beyond @entity1 's shores and then returning home
" it 's what everyone wants , " she said
" to be a normal country and be like all the people who can just buy a ticket and come to @entity1
that we could go other places too
