-- ok , go ahead and get the " where 's my global warming ? " jokes out of your system
with the @entity9 @entity8 trudging through its second blizzard in a week , we understand
but while it may seem contradictory at first , scientists say bigger blizzards fit the pattern they expect to see from a changing climate
the immediate meteorological cause of the back - to - back snowstorms is a colder - than - normal mass of air that 's been hovering over the central @entity9 , combined with an amped - up jet stream that 's been dipping south from @entity21
that makes conditions ripe for major snowstorms after a warmer - than - normal january for most of the @entity25
" once you get into a pattern that sets up these storms , they can repeat themselves , " @entity26 told @entity0
the 21 inches that fell on @entity33 , @entity34 , in february just broke a monthly snowfall record set in 1913
@entity36 , @entity37 , saw 19 inches of snow on monday alone , a total greater than its annual average and smashing a daily record of 12 inches that had stood since 1893
as researchers are quick to point out , weather is different than climate
weather is what happens today , while climate involves trends in temperature and precipitation over decades
but global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees @entity51 ( 0.8 degrees @entity52 ) since the 1880s , according to @entity54 , and because warmer air holds more moisture , a cold snap is likely to leave more snow on the ground
" we have to keep in mind that in any given winter , you 're going to have some big snowstorms , " said @entity60 , a research meteorologist at the @entity61
" but we 're loading the dice or stacking the deck toward more intense blizzards
" while the idea of long - term climate change is a controversial notion politically , it 's accepted as fact by most researchers
the warming trend is expected to continue if heat - trapping carbon dioxide -- a byproduct of fossil fuels -- continues to build up in the atmosphere
@entity80 , who studies snowfall patterns and climate at @entity83 , said the overall trend for snowfall in the western @entity9 is down
@entity80 said her recent research points to more snow at high elevations and the @entity89 , but the rest of the country would see less
" the seasonal cycle is changing , and less of it accumulating , " @entity80 said
@entity60 said scientists ca n't attribute any one storm to the effects of climate change , any more than they can point to a single home run as evidence that a baseball player has been using steroids
" but when we get blizzards , they 'll be stronger , " he said .
