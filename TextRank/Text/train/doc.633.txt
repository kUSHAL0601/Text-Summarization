-- at least four @entity2 soldiers were killed and three others wounded in violence in @entity5 on thursday , medical and news agency sources said
the city 's @entity7 said it received the bodies of three soldiers killed in fighting that broke out in the eastern @entity14 district
residents reported fighting between the army and an unidentified armed group thursday afternoon near the eastern entrance to @entity5
earlier thursday , a @entity2 soldier was shot dead by unknown assailants outside his home in the city 's @entity25 neighborhood , the @entity20 state news agency reported
on wednesday , @entity7 said it received the bodies of three security force members who were shot dead in the city
the latest violence comes after fierce fighting in @entity5 on monday between army special forces and members of the militant @entity35 group @entity34
at least nine people were killed and dozens injured in the fighting
the @entity38 says it believes @entity34 was responsible for the attack on its diplomatic mission in @entity5 last year that killed ambassador @entity41 and three other @entity38
attacks on security force members have spiked in the eastern city in recent weeks , especially as more troops were deployed in @entity5 in an effort to secure the city
on wednesday , the government said security cameras had arrived in the city and were being installed as part of the security plan
over the past year , @entity5 has had some of the worst violence in @entity2 with a series of bombings and a campaign of assassinations that have mainly targeted security force members
many @entity2 and human rights groups blame authorities for failing to hold anyone accountable for the violence
while no one claims responsibility for these attacks , residents and security officials in the city blame @entity35 militias
more than two years after the fall of the @entity72 regime , the government is struggling to control the hundreds of militias across the country and @entity35 extremist groups , some with ties to @entity78 , mostly in the eastern part of @entity2 .
