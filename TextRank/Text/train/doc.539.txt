-- only a week after @entity2 surprised viewers with his on - air vow to step down from late - night tv in 2015 , @entity1 moved with stunning speed to anoint and announce his replacement : @entity9 's @entity8
@entity8 , who has hosted " @entity12 " since 2005 in the tongue - in - cheek character of a pompous political conservative , was quoted by @entity13 of the @entity14 as saying he would be appearing on @entity1 as himself , not his comic alter ego
signing the quotable and often controversial @entity8 , with his legion of " @entity12 " social media fans , clearly is a gain for @entity1
but for fans of @entity8 , and for @entity8 himself , it 's much more of a risk
the @entity1 thought process is easy to deconstruct
either the network was going to give the " @entity26 " slot , when it opened , to @entity27 , who has toiled loyally in the time slot following it for as long as " @entity12 " has been on cable , or to someone else
@entity27 will be 52 next month -- but @entity8 , also next month , will turn 50 , compared with @entity33 's @entity32 and @entity35 's @entity34 , who later this year will turn 46 and 40 , respectively
so the issue is n't so much age as , perhaps , buzz , with @entity8 's social media savvy giving him the edge
the question now becomes , though , how much edge can @entity8 bring to @entity1 , especially without the once - removed antagonistic persona of his @entity9 blowhard ? @entity45 offended too many people when he was on a late - night broadcast show , " politically incorrect , " but the same act has thrived , and taken root , on cable 's @entity50
going in the opposite direction , how many edges must colbert sand off to maintain or increase a loyal audience on @entity1 ? in character on " @entity12 , " @entity8 is such a smart and funny interviewer that , even out of character , he should prove much better in that department than either of the late - night @entity61
but unless he generates the same sort of viral videos , most of them musical , that @entity32 and @entity65 have presented so successfully , @entity8 may struggle to compete
@entity8 is a very strong singer -- even @entity66 thinks so , and cast him in a concert version of " company " -- so he could do that sort of thing
but does he even want to ? and will his @entity9 audience even follow him to @entity1 ? success in one arena does n't necessarily translate after a move to another venue
personally , i like what @entity1 is gaining here
the potential for @entity8 , who 's such a phenomenal workhorse on his current show , to craft a new show for @entity1 is enticing , and the unknown factor of what he will bring to the program as himself should generate plenty of publicity
for @entity1 , the move makes sense
but for @entity8 , the transplant could be tricky
young viewers -- and he certainly has them -- are fickle , and those who watch him on the more subversive @entity9 may not be inclined to switch to the less cool @entity1 just to follow him
and many , like myself , will miss " @entity12 " greatly
there 's no show on tv quite like it
( the logical replacement for @entity8 , thinking one more step ahead , would be former " @entity100 " correspondent @entity99 , but his new current events comedy show begins later this month on @entity50 -- so he may or may not be available when the slot opens next year
) and in addition to losing " @entity12 , " viewers also are all but certain to lose " the @entity106 " when his current contract expires -- so that 's two entertaining late - night programs that we 're losing , just to get a replacement for @entity2
whether it all ends up being a good exchange for viewers depends on those other replacements , and how good @entity8 ends up being at playing a formerly unseen and untested role : himself
my guess is that , as himself , @entity8 will produce and star in a very good show indeed
but with the show being on @entity1 in the multimedia climate of 2015 , my worry is whether that will prove to be enough .
