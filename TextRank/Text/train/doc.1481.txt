@entity0 -- prime minister @entity2 of @entity3 reorganized his cabinet ministers on monday , bringing in a woman with strong links to @entity7 amid a smoldering dispute between the two nations over a group of remote islands
@entity2 named @entity12 , whose father oversaw the normalization of relations with @entity7 40 years ago , as education minister -- one of string of new appointments
@entity12 , who served as foreign minister more than 10 years ago under former prime minister @entity20 , returns to the cabinet as @entity2 tries to manage the fallout from the clash with @entity24 over the disputed islands in the @entity26
dangerous waters : behind the islands dispute @entity3 controls and administers the islands , but @entity7 says they are an integral part of its territory that @entity0 " stole " in the 19th century
the islands are known as @entity34 in @entity3 and @entity34 in @entity7
the @entity3 government 's announcement last month of the acquisition of several of the disputed islands from a @entity3 family has heightened tensions between the two countries
violent @entity43 protests have taken place in @entity7 cities , and economic ties between @entity48 's two largest economies have started to sour
meanwhile , patrol vessels from the two countries have been frequently locked in tense games of cat and mouse in the waters around the islands after @entity7 sent a flotilla of ships to the area
@entity7 passion , fury fuels @entity61 attacks the appointment monday of @entity12 to the cabinet may be interpreted as an effort to soothe those tensions by @entity2
her father , @entity66 , was prime minister in 1972 when @entity0 and @entity24 resumed diplomatic relations decades after @entity3 's occupation of large swathes of eastern @entity7 in the 1930s and 40s
she was nonetheless a controversial figure during her time as foreign minister at the start of this century for the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , the political opponents of @entity2 's @entity76 ( @entity76 )
@entity20 sacked her in 2002 , saying a public dispute between her and her top aides was effectively preventing critical budget bills from passing through parliament
she once reportedly called the @entity81 a " den of devils , an evil place where conspiracies are plotted
" her outspokenness earned her bureaucratic enemies but gained her popularity with the @entity3 public
how a remote rock split @entity7 and @entity3 she also contradicted @entity20 's government policy on relations between @entity7 and @entity93 and on a controversial history textbook approved by @entity0 that critics in @entity48 said whitewashed @entity3 war crimes
it is unclear what influence she will have on diplomatic relations in her role as education minister
@entity102 will remain as foreign minister under the reshuffle
the others changes to @entity2 's cabinet included the appointment of @entity109 , a senior @entity76 lawmaker , as finance minister .
