they are two of the continent 's acknowledged football powerhouses and later sunday either @entity4 or @entity5 will end a long and frustrating wait to be crowned @entity8 champions
@entity5 last lifted the trophy 33 years ago and was beaten in the 1992 final by @entity4 , the last time the elephants claimed the prestigious crown
the meeting in @entity14 will bring down the curtain on a tournament -- hosted at the last minute by @entity17 after @entity18 declined because of @entity20 fears -- which has seen some fine football but also been blighted by crowd trouble inside and outside the stadiums
@entity5 's 3 - 0 semifinal win over the hosts saw the worst scenes , with a helicopter deployed to disperse fans at the @entity29 and the game held up for several minutes
overshadowed by the violent scenes was a solid team performance by the @entity5 , with @entity33 , the son of the legendary @entity34 , rounding off the scoring with his third goal of the competition
@entity4 , with a host of talented players such as @entity41 's @entity40 and the club 's new signing @entity42 , has come on strong after needing to beat @entity45 to reach the knockout stages
the @entity47 will start marginal favorites to win the @entity8 for the second time
@entity5 is a four - time winner and has five wins in nine matches with @entity4 at the finals , losing three with the other drawn .
