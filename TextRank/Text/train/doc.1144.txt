the @entity1 has n't abandoned @entity2 , the retired @entity3 agent described by his wife as the " longest - held @entity1 hostage , " secretary of state @entity0 said sunday
" there has n't been progress in the sense that we do n't have him back
but to suggest that we 've abandoned him or anybody ... is simply incorrect and not helpful , " @entity0 told @entity15 's " @entity14
" " the fact is that i have personally raised the issue , not only at the highest level that i have been involved with , but also through other intermediaries
" @entity20 disappeared in @entity21 in march 2007 during a business trip , purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling
however , the @entity25 and the @entity26 reported thursday that contrary to what the @entity27 and @entity20 's family have said for years , @entity20 actually was working for the @entity30 in @entity21
and a source involved in the matter told @entity33 there 's proof that @entity20 worked for the @entity30 undercover , and under contract , while also working as a private investigator
@entity39 : @entity20 not a government employee when he made @entity21 trip that allegation does n't sit well with sen. @entity44 , @entity45 , who is on the @entity46
" what disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the @entity51
the @entity30 did not tell the truth to the @entity51 about mr. @entity2 , " @entity44 said sunday on @entity33 's " @entity52
" " if that 's true , then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees did n't know about other activities , which have been revealed by ( @entity62 leaker edward ) snowden -- maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of @entity51 over our different intelligence agencies
" @entity21 's government repeatedly has said it is not holding @entity20 and does not know his whereabouts
during a september interview with @entity33 's @entity71 , @entity21 president @entity69 was asked what he could tell @entity20 's family
" we do n't know where he is , who he is , " @entity69 said
" he is an @entity1 who has disappeared
we have no news of him
" @entity44 : @entity30 did not tell @entity51 the truth about @entity20 @entity0 said the @entity1 is still looking for proof that @entity20 is alive
a " number of different channels " are " being worked aggressively , " he said
@entity21 's previous president , @entity83 , said he was willing to help find @entity20 , and the family received what then - secretary of state @entity85 described in 2010 as " proof of life
" in 2011 , the @entity27 said new evidence suggested that @entity20 , who has diabetes and high blood pressure , was alive and being held somewhere in southwest @entity91
this year , a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity33 , " we have every reason to believe that he 's alive and that the @entity21 control his fate
" asked whether he believes the @entity21 government is responsible for @entity20 's disappearance , @entity0 said he thinks the government " has the ability to help us here , and we hope they will
" @entity44 said he was " confident we are doing everything that we can " to get @entity20 released from @entity21 , he added that any negotiations in @entity20 's case should also include attempts to free other @entity1 who are believed to be in @entity21 custody
