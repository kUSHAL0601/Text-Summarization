@entity0 -- @entity3 home secretary @entity2 sat down with officials from the social media industry thursday , her office said , as the government considers trying to ban people from social networking during or after crises
but the government " did not seek any additional powers to close down social media networks , " the @entity11 said
@entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity19 maker @entity15 all declined to say beforehand what position they would take at the meeting
top police officers and other government officials were also present for the meeting , which follows riots that swept @entity26 earlier this month
prime minister @entity27 suggested limits on social networking in the wake of the unrest
he told parliament august 11 that " when people are using social media for violence , we need to stop them
" thursday 's meeting was about " whether and how we should be able to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence , disorder and criminality , " the @entity11 said in a statement prior to the discussion
" social networking is not a cause of the recent disturbances but a means of enabling criminals to communicate , " it said
" we are working with the police to see what action can be taken to prevent access to those services by customers identified as perpetrators of disorder or other criminal action , " the ministry said
police and politicians have pointed to social networking sites , such as @entity16 and @entity17 , as well as mobile messaging services like @entity19 's , as tools used to organize looting and violence
two men have been sent to prison for posts on @entity17 urging people to riot in northwest @entity26
@entity71 named them as @entity72 , 20 , and @entity73 , 22 , when they were sentenced last week
neither of their @entity17 posts resulted in any rioting , a @entity71 spokeswoman said
in handing down the sentence at @entity80 , judge @entity78 said he hoped the sentence would serve as a deterrent to others
@entity71 assistant chief constable @entity84 said " technology was used to spread incitement and bring people together to commit acts of criminality , " making it " easy to understand the four - year sentences that were handed down in court
" the unrest , which was sparked by the shooting of a man in @entity0 august 6 , led to widespread looting and damage
five deaths have been linked to the violence
the @entity100 sent a representative to thursday 's meeting , it confirmed , but declined to give any other details , saying it was a private meeting
the group has not taken a position on whether people should be barred from social networking
@entity0 's @entity109 also declined to say what its position would be at the meeting
@entity1 's @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .
