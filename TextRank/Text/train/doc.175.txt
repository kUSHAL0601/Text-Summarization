-- though a sequel for " the @entity5 " has been greenlit , one star who was integral to bringing the franchise into the new millennium wo n't be a part of it , reports @entity8
@entity9 told the site he wo n't be signing up for another round with @entity12 " it 's true [ that i wo n't be in the sequel ] , " said @entity9 , " but it 's totally amicable

" @entity9 said he wants " to pursue more human - related projects , " adding , " all i wanted to do was to set the stage for them to do whatever they wanted
i 'm sure i 'll return in some capacity here and there , but that was half a decade of my life
five years of hard work
i 'm ready for a little puppet break
