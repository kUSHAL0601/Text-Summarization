-- the deadliest @entity2 outbreak in history continues to plague @entity4 as leaders scramble to stop the virus from spreading
over the weekend , @entity8 president @entity7 closed most of the country 's borders
the few points of entry that are still open will have @entity2 testing centers and will implement preventive measures , she said
the president also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels , restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five - minute video on @entity2 safety
" no doubt the ebola virus is a national health problem , " @entity7 said
" it attacks our way of life , with serious economic and social consequences
as such we are compelled to bring the totality of our national resolve to fight this scourge
" as of july 20 , the @entity32 had confirmed 224 cases of @entity2 in @entity8 , including 127 deaths
overall , @entity2 has killed at least 660 people in @entity4
there were 45 new cases reported in the region between july 18 and july 20
ebola : fast facts health officials are worried about the virus spreading to other countries in the region
this is the first such outbreak to hit @entity4
on friday , a @entity8 man with @entity2 died in @entity49 , @entity47 , @entity47 health minister @entity46 said
@entity50 arrived at @entity49 ' airport on july 20 and was isolated at a local hospital after exhibiting common @entity2 symptoms
he told officials he had no direct contact with anyone who had the virus
@entity59 commissioner dr. @entity58 said authorities are working to identify people who may have come in contact with the man on his flights
the process has been delayed , he said , because the airline has not provided the passenger lists for all three of the flights @entity50 took
@entity50 flew first to @entity69 before he went to @entity70 and then switched planes to fly to @entity47 , according to the health commissioner
" in collaboration with the @entity74 , i 've also put into motion mechanisms to track down all contacts at high risk , " @entity58 said
the state department has identified 59 people so far who came into contact with the man
twenty have been tested for @entity2
on monday , @entity81 , one of @entity47 's biggest airlines , suspended operations into the country 's capital , @entity87 , and another city called @entity89 , according to @entity90
it is unlikely the virus would spread on a plane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person 's bodily fluids , according to the @entity98
meanwhile , @entity100 health care workers helping to fight this deadly disease abroad have put themselves at risk
dr. @entity103 , a 33 - year - old @entity104 resident , had been treating @entity2 patients in @entity87 when he started to feel sick
@entity103 works with @entity106 , a @entity107 international relief agency founded by evangelists @entity108 and @entity110
he has been the medical director for the @entity111 in @entity87 and has been working to help @entity2 patients since october
deadliest ever outbreak : what you need to know " when the @entity2 outbreak hit , he took on responsibilities with our @entity2 direct clinical treatment response , but he was serving in a missionary hospital in @entity8 prior to his work with @entity2 patients , " said @entity115 , a spokeswoman for the organization
after testing positive for @entity2 , he went into treatment at a @entity106 isolation center at @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity87
his condition is rapidly deteriorating and @entity106 has been working to evacuate him for better care , but @entity8 is not allowing the evacuation , according to @entity106 vice president of international relief , @entity130
the reason for the delay is unclear
the @entity98 said the doctor 's family had been with him , but left for the @entity100 before he became symptomatic ; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him
out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21 - day fever watch , the @entity98 said
another @entity100 working with @entity106 has also been infected
@entity143 from @entity144 , @entity145 , works with @entity146 , or @entity146
she and her husband used to work with orphans and other children who struggle with poverty - related issues but expanded their efforts to take on the complex medical problems in @entity87
she had teamed up with the staff from @entity106 to help fight the @entity2 outbreak in @entity87 when she got sick
she , too , is undergoing treatment
a spokesperson for @entity106 said there have been riots outside the clinic
another doctor who has played a key role in fighting the outbreak in @entity163 , dr. sheik @entity164 , is sick
he is being treated by the @entity166 aid group @entity165 -- also known as @entity165 -- in @entity167 , @entity163 , according to a representative of that agency
@entity164 had been overseeing treatment of @entity2 patients in isolation units at @entity173 , which is about 185 miles ( 298 kilometers ) east of the capital , @entity89
@entity163 's minister of health and sanitation called the doctor a national hero for the sacrifices he has made in trying to stop the outbreak
doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected
it can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person 's bodily fluids
the disease is not contagious until symptoms appear
symptoms of @entity2 include fever , fatigue and headaches
they can appear two to 21 days after infection , meaning many who are sick do n't know it
the early symptoms then can progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function , and sometimes internal and external bleeding
leaders in the international health community characterize the @entity2 epidemic as the " deadliest ever
" while the @entity32 has mobilized to fight the epidemic , it can be a difficult one to stop
it is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90 % of those who catch it
the death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60 % since it has been treated early in many cases
there is , however , no @entity2 vaccination
is it time to test experimental vaccines ? with the announcement that @entity8 is closing its borders , the country also instituted a new travel policy to inspect and test all outgoing and incoming passengers
the hope is that such measures will stop the spread of the virus
there has never been a confirmed case of @entity2 spreading to a developed country , said @entity234 , an epidemiologist with @entity165
" this is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick , have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations , they do n't travel
" and even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country , they will be in a good hospital with good infection control , so they are very unlikely to infect others , " she said
" this is not the great plague , " @entity0 's dr. @entity246 said after his trip to the region in the spring
" but it is a pretty formidable killer
" " the grim reality is it often kills so quickly , people do n't have time to spread it
" the @entity98 held a media briefing monday to emphasize the fact that there is " no significant risk in the @entity100 " for an @entity2 outbreak
@entity98 officials said with the spread of @entity2 to @entity100 health care workers , there is a real need for " vigilance " to make sure workers are careful , get tested if there is any suspicion of illness , and that all sick travelers should remain isolated when returning from areas affected directly by the epidemic
@entity272 , @entity98 's deputy director of the @entity273 , said the @entity98 is working with @entity100 health care providers to educate them about @entity2
the agency sent a notice monday to remind doctors to take important steps to avoid the spread of the illness , including asking their patients about their travel history , particularly if they have traveled to @entity4 in the last three weeks
