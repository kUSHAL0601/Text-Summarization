-- with home sales falling to five - year lows , homeowners desperate to sell their homes are looking for a little divine intervention
retailers report statues of @entity8 are selling briskly
@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 , had her one - bedroom home on the market for four months
every weekend there was an open house
but there were no offers
that 's until she took her mom 's advice and buried a statue of @entity8 upside down in her front yard
the next week , she had three offers and her home was sold
" i could n't believe it
i do n't know what it is about it
it 's some sort of a miracle , " says @entity9
this " miracle " has it roots in @entity35
according to the tradition , burying @entity8 began hundreds of years ago in @entity38
@entity39 , a nun in the 16th century , buried a medal of the saint and prayed to @entity8 to help secure land for a convent
the ritual is said to have worked , and so the trend of burying @entity8 has caught on
just ask @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49
his online retail site , @entity51 , offers the " underground real estate agent " home - selling kits
for $ 9.95 , the 4 - inch statue comes with a burial bag and a burial instruction booklet
there 's even an 8 - inch version of the statue for larger homes
sales have increased 100 percent in the past two years , according to @entity47
@entity62 , who runs @entity63 -- a catholic supply company on @entity65 , says sales of the @entity67 spiked last year
and he expects the trend to last
" we 're probably going to sell over 100,000 this year , " he says
the biggest demand is coming from the @entity71 and the @entity72 , he says
@entity73 , the store manager at a @entity35 retail supply store in @entity75 , @entity76 , says the statues have been one of the better sellers , with sales increasing 25 percent this year
" people seem more panicked and there is a hurried - ness to their expression when they come in , " she says
@entity8 is even on the auction block
there are dozens of @entity8 home - selling kits on @entity87
from glow in the dark @entity8 statues to mini pocket shrines , @entity8 has a whole new following
burying @entity8 statues has its own set of rules , too , although they can vary
home sellers are instructed to dig a hole near the " @entity99 " sign
the hole should be three inches taller than the statue itself
the saint should then be facing the direction of the street
then prayers to @entity8 should be said before the saint is covered with dirt
once the house is sold , @entity8 should be dug up and put in a place of honor in the new home
some renters have even cashed in on @entity8 's divine intervention in hopes of getting a break on rent or to have their application accepted
they buried @entity8 statues in flowerpots
the statue 's feet should either be facing the street or in the direction you want to move , according to @entity47
the whole statue - burying process was a bit hard to swallow for @entity127
his @entity129 , @entity130 , home was on the market earlier this month
@entity127 first heard about the ritual from his godfather
" i looked on the @entity134
it was less than $ 10
so , i said why not ? " recalls @entity127
six hours later a young woman walked into the house and made a bid
" i 'm not very religious , " says @entity127
" but that was pretty amazing
" @entity8 may have made a believer out of some sellers , but for some real estate agents , selling a home is n't the work of a higher power
" what a crock ! " says @entity147 real estate agent @entity146
" as a realtor i think it 's ridiculous
the business has always been simple
if a house is properly priced and properly exposed , it 'll attract buyers and it will sell -- @entity8 or no @entity155
" @entity47 says the statue is more than just superstition
" it 's the idea of getting beyond yourself
it 's about hoping and praying for something that is bigger than you are , " he says
and these days , maybe just a little hope for home sellers is n't such a bad thing
