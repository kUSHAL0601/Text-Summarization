@entity0 -- sixteen years ago , @entity2 was found guilty of second - degree murder for the death of a 4 - year - old girl caught in a gang - related shootout
but the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity0 , is now taking a second look at his case after another murder conviction was overturned in march
@entity13 ' conviction review is one of 50 investigations from the @entity17 's @entity16 that was sparked after prosecutors suggested that @entity20 's second - degree murder conviction of a rabbi in 1991 be tossed out
a witness came forward years after the case and said that an investigator coached him into identifying @entity20 in a lineup
@entity20 , who insisted he was innocent for years , was freed from prison after serving 23 years
the same detective was involved in @entity2 ' investigation
@entity2 , now 37 , said that former @entity30 officer @entity29 beat him , wrote the words of a confession he was forced to sign and smudged his signature , according to @entity34 , @entity2 ' lawyer
@entity34 said there were multiple red flags raised through the trial , despite @entity13 being found guilty and sentenced to 16Â½ years to life
according to @entity34 , none of the six eyewitnesses identified @entity2 at trial , though two said they identified him earlier in a lineup
@entity2 also insisted on testifying in court , a rare occurrence often insisted upon by the innocent , @entity34 said
@entity34 suggests that the high - profile crime of an innocent victim and the public 's demand for action led police to inaccurately charge @entity2
" @entity2 knew many of the people in that area implicated by gang violence , " @entity34 told @entity1 on monday
" it was ... guilt by association
" " i believe that he forced him to talk , " @entity2 ' sister , @entity57 , said of @entity29
" from day one , he has been saying this
" @entity29 told @entity1 on monday : " i never , ever beat a confession out of anyone
i never mistreated a defendant
i was one of the finest of the finest , and my name in the police department was synonymous with honor
" the @entity67 's @entity7 said it could not comment on the case , calling it an open investigation
@entity29 retired from the @entity30 before the investigations began
@entity1 's @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 contributed to this report .
