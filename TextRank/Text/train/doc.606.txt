-- most parents think their children share too much information online -- and that search engines and social networks are n't doing enough to protect privacy , according to poll results released friday
more than 90 percent of the parents surveyed by @entity9 said they are " concerned " that their children share too much information online , and 75 percent said they would rate the job social networks are doing to protect online privacy as " negative
" the results , released by the nonprofit advocacy organization @entity14 -- which commissioned the poll -- do not mention particular social networks or websites by name
@entity14 ceo @entity19 said the need for reform is clear
" parents want far more education and leadership about online privacy , and they clearly want the industry and the federal government to update privacy policies , " @entity19 said in a statement
the organization begins a campaign monday aimed at protecting kids ' personal information and reputations online
" we need a ' @entity37 ' approach ' similar to the ' do not call ' policies that restrict telemarketers , " @entity19 said
the results also include a survey of 401 teenagers aged 15 to 18
@entity14 said 79 percent of the teens surveyed also think their friends share too much personal information online , and 85 percent of them want search engines and social networking sites to ask for permission before using personal information to market products
" the poll results present a clear divide between the industry 's view of privacy and the opinion of parents and kids , " @entity19 said
to conduct the online poll of parents , @entity9 used a sampling of 2,100 adults from its online panel , which the polling firm says is representative of the adult population of the @entity67
the sampling margin of error is 2.2 percentage points
the sampling margin of error for the online poll of teenagers was 5 percentage points .
