@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 voted wednesday to make speaker @entity4 , @entity5 , their leader for the 112th @entity6 , overcoming objections from moderates who argued that she was partly responsible for the party 's overwhelming defeat at the polls two weeks ago
republicans , who won a net gain of at least 61 seats in the elections , will control the @entity3 next year
they unanimously chose to be led once again by veteran @entity17 rep. @entity16 , now in line to inherit the speaker 's gavel from @entity4
@entity4 turned back a challenge from @entity23 rep. @entity22 , a member of the party 's diminished centrist " @entity26 " faction , in a 150 - 43 vote
the speaker -- now set to be @entity3 minority leader in january -- retained the solid support of party liberals , who have noted her fundraising prowess and past ability to lead congressional democrats to power , among other things
an earlier motion to delay the @entity2 leadership vote until december 8 was easily defeated in a 68 - 129 vote
some rank - and - file members were seeking more time to " fully understand the causes of our historic losses " in the midterm elections , according to the resolution
one senior @entity2 aide called support for the resolution " a proxy vote " against @entity4
addressing reporters after her election , @entity4 said the message @entity2 got on @entity52 is that people " want jobs
" chalking up @entity2 losses to the 9.6 unemployment rate , she said @entity2 would " strive to work together , wherever possible , in a bipartisan way " on both job creation and deficit reduction
@entity4 brushed aside a question about her low national approval ratings
" i 'd like to see what your ( approval ) ratings would be " if $ 75 million in negative ads had been spent against you , she told one reporter
speaking earlier , @entity22 claimed the @entity2 leadership contest " was n't about winning or losing
" it was about ensuring " moderates are heard within the [ @entity2 ] caucus and that we have a seat at the table , " he said
@entity2 avoided a contentious fight for the no. 2 slot between the more moderate @entity78 rep. @entity77 -- the current @entity3 majority leader -- and the more liberal @entity81 rep. @entity80 , now the majority whip
under a deal brokered by @entity4 , @entity77 will become the minority whip in the next @entity6 -- the second @entity2 slot -- while @entity80 will serve as assistant leader , a newly created third @entity2 position
@entity89 rep. @entity88 remains democratic caucus chairman , with @entity5 rep. @entity91 rounding out the top leadership as caucus vice chair
some defeated @entity26 members argued that by retaining @entity4 and the rest of the current leadership , @entity2 were making it tougher to recapture the @entity3 in the near future
@entity4 is " the face that defeated us in this last election , " @entity100 rep. @entity99 told @entity1
" it seems to me that at some point you have to put your personal agenda and ambitions aside for the good of the country and certainly the party
" " i do n't know how we go into these districts like the one i represented ... and recruit good moderate @entity2 if you have the same leadership , " he said
on the @entity119 side of the aisle , @entity16 will be followed by @entity122 rep. @entity121 -- soon to be majority leader
@entity5 rep. @entity124 is slated to become majority whip , with @entity127 rep. @entity126 filling the fourth slot
the massive 80 - plus - member @entity119 freshman class will have two representatives in the party 's leadership -- @entity134 's @entity133 and @entity81 's @entity135 -- one of two new @entity137
@entity16 , who marked his 61st birthday wednesday , will have to balance competing interests within the suddenly swollen ranks of his party 's caucus
the incoming speaker will have to work with the @entity145 administration on various legislative priorities while also placating @entity148 activists who won seats on a platform of opposing the @entity3 and sticking to strict conservative principles
" this is the dawn of a new majority , " @entity16 said
" one i believe will be humbler , wiser , and more focused than its predecessors on the priorities of the people
" " and what ( the people ) want is a smaller , less costly , more accountable government , " he concluded
" more jobs , less spending
" @entity1 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report
