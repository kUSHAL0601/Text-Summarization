-- for sen. @entity4 , the @entity2 ' firing of running back @entity3 on monday does n't come close to addressing how the @entity5 deals with domestic violence
he said the league " deserves special scrutiny " for such matters
@entity4 said he wo n't " rule out " @entity11 involvement to pressure the @entity5 to alter its " deep - seated fundamental far - reaching problem " involving domestic abuse
the @entity15 @entity14 , who has been a sharp critic of the @entity5 's handling of domestic violence issues , said @entity5 commissioner @entity23 's leadership has been " completely lacking , " adding that it should not require recorded evidence to punish someone for abuse
as football season finished its opening weekend , @entity11 pounced on a variety of issues in addition to domestic abuse
members of @entity11 are up in arms over @entity5 - imposed media blackouts of games and the league 's tax - exempt status
while @entity11 has n't done anything about it , it holds the league 's antitrust exemption over its head to ensure the league stays in line
the @entity5 works to keep @entity11 at bay , too
its political donations favor incumbents and are divided mostly equally between @entity45 and @entity46
the @entity5 's lobbying activity spiked after 2006 to more than $ 1 million per year , according to the @entity48
" there 's only one @entity5 , so by definition it gets special treatment , " @entity4 said
reactions pour in lesson of @entity3 case : stop blaming victim
