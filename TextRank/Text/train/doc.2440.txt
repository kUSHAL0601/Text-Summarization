after an appeal by the player that the punishment was excessive was rejected
the decision means the @entity21 international -- who scored @entity3 's only goal in a 1 - 0 @entity14 quarterfinal victory against @entity15 on wednesday -- will now miss a crunch domestic cup semifinal against city rivals @entity17 on april 16 as well as saturday 's @entity19 clash with @entity20
the ban was initially imposed by the @entity6 after @entity2 shouted expletives directly in front of a tv camera during his hat - trick celebration in a 4 - 2 league win against @entity29 last saturday
the 25 - year - old said his outburst had been provoked by " continuous verbal abuse from @entity29 supporters
" but in an official statement released on thursday , the @entity6 said : " @entity2 had admitted a charge for the use of offensive , insulting and / or abusive language , but claimed that the automatic penalty of two games was clearly excessive
" the commission did not accept the claim and @entity2 will begin the standard two - match suspension with immediate effect
" in a statement issued through his spokesman @entity45 to @entity0 , @entity2 said he was " gutted " to miss two matches
" i am not the first player to have sworn on tv and i wo n't be the last , " the statement read
" unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera , i apologized immediately and yet i am the only person banned for swearing
" that does n't seem right
i have to accept that what 's happened has happened and move on from here , " @entity2 added
@entity3 also issued a statement on their official website expressing disappointment in the @entity6 's decision to uphold the ban
" the club put forward a very strong case to have the punishment reduced , which was unsuccessful , " the statement read
" @entity2 apologized immediately after the match and the club now wishes to move to on to what hopefully will be a very exciting conclusion to the season
" the @entity6 's decision came a day after soft drink company @entity70 announced they planned to discontinue their $ 980,000 - a - year ( Â£ 600,000 ) contract with the footballer
" our contract with @entity2 came to an end last year and we mutually agreed that we would not renew our relationship
we 're really proud of the work we 've done with @entity2 over the years [ and ] we wish @entity2 well in his career , " @entity76 told @entity0 in a statement
however , @entity2 will be eligible to play in tuesday 's second - leg @entity14 quarterfinal against @entity15 at @entity81 and in the @entity19 match against @entity83 on april 19 .
