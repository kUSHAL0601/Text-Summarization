@entity0 -- a day and a half after he was arrested on a drunk - driving charge , @entity3 administrator @entity4 co-piloted a government jet to @entity8 as part of a proficiency flight , @entity3 officials confirmed wednesday
the flight was planned before @entity4 's saturday - night arrest , officials said , and took place as scheduled monday morning
@entity4 does not appear to have violated any @entity3 rules by taking the flight
since he has not been convicted of @entity17 , he was under no formal obligation to report the arrest , and there is no suggestion that he violated a " bottle to throttle " rule requiring eight hours to pass between alcohol consumption and flying
but @entity4 earned the ire of his boss -- transportation secretary @entity28 -- by not notifying him of the arrest
@entity28 learned of the arrest about 1 p.m. monday after a @entity32 police department published a press release announcing the arrest
@entity4 , meanwhile , was just returning from the proficiency flight
within an hour , the @entity36 issued a press release saying that @entity4 had asked to be placed on leave , and the request had been accepted
on tuesday , @entity28 told reporters he was " very disappointed " in the way he had learned about the arrest
@entity4 resigned later tuesday , saying he did not want anything to " cast a shadow " on the @entity3
the resignation brought to an end a tumultuous four days that began about 10:30 p.m. saturday when a @entity49 , @entity32 , police officer said he noticed @entity4 driving on the wrong side of @entity51 , police said
@entity4 was the sole occupant of the vehicle and cooperated fully with police , according to police police said after it was determined that @entity4 was under the influence of alcohol , he was taken to a jail where he was charged with driving while intoxicated and released on personal recognizance
@entity3 officials said @entity4 had no official duties over the weekend
@entity4 did not return a reporter 's phone call
on monday , @entity4 went on a proficiency flight in an @entity3 aircraft , departing @entity67 near @entity0 , flying to @entity68 , @entity8 , and then on to @entity69 , where the plane landed for fuel before returning to @entity0
the flight was intended as training for the @entity3 's new satellite - based navigation system known as @entity76 , the @entity3 said
the @entity3 said administrators with pilot 's licenses are permitted to fly @entity3 aircraft
" @entity4 served as a licensed pilot and maintained qualifications to fly @entity3 airplanes on official business , " the @entity3 said
" this helps provide firsthand knowledge of the @entity87 aviation system
" in this case , another pilot served as pilot in command during the flight , the @entity3 said
under federal regulations , @entity3 - licensed pilots must notify the @entity3 within 60 days of being convicted of a drunk driving charge , or when they apply for medical recertification
neither applied to @entity4 , although officials said senior officials are held to a higher standard .
