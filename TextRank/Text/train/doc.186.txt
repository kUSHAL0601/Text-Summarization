it was replaced by a dark - haired man in a dapper , pin - stripped suit
a woman in her 20s clung to his arm
@entity15 authorities have said @entity3 is not a suspect
they only want to talk to him about the november 11 shooting of @entity52 , 52 , who was found dead in his own home
" i am not concerned because i have not been charged with a crime , so there is no basis for extradition , " @entity3 said from @entity0
