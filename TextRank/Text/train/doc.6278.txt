-- when @entity2 hand out @entity4 candy next week they may inadvertently be contributing to the destruction of orangutan habitat thousands of miles away
but do n't feel guilty
instead , do something about it
many types of @entity4 candy -- and lots of other packaged foods in the @entity2 -- contain palm oil , much of which is farmed in @entity14 and @entity15 , where orangutans live
wild forests that support the endangered orangutan are being chopped down and burned to grow geometric rows of trees that ultimately produce oil
the use of palm oil in processed foods is way , way up in part because it does n't contain trans fat , which the @entity2 says must be labeled on food packaging because of its unhealthiness
the @entity2 imports about 10 times as much palm oil now as it did in the mid- 1990s
it 's not that the oil is evil
it 's that production methods need to change
" orangutans are just so compelling , " said @entity36 , a spokesman for the @entity37 , which recently released a report called " @entity39
" the report links irresponsible palm oil production to modern slavery and climate change -- in addition to the destruction of orangutan habitat
" they 're as closely related to us as chimpanzees
they , in a very , very real way , are being threatened with extinction , and palm oil is the single biggest threat they face
" one way to help is simply to tell snack food and candy companies that you care about orangutans and about the rain forest in southeast @entity62
the @entity37 has made that easy
the group , which recently got some buzz on blogs for posting a staged video of an orangutan called @entity68 ( not her real name ) communicating in sign language and via video chat with a hearing - impaired girl , has started an online campaign called " @entity75 of the @entity76
" the group is asking people to upload photos of their palms ( got ta love a homonym ) to a website
it 's hoping to collect 60,600 images -- or one human hand for every orangutan in the wild
they 're going to deliver the images to companies that produce products from palm oil , @entity36 told me
" we really realized that the scale of the problem is so extreme and so large that we really wanted to help jump - start a national conversation about palm oil , " he said , " and reach out beyond the choir
" @entity37 has a list of ways to get involved on its website
the most interesting , to me , is an effort to slap stickers that say " warning ! this snack food may cause orangutan extinction " on products in grocery stores
to similar effect , other groups are trying to encourage consumers to buy @entity4 candy that either does n't contain palm oil or contains only palm oil that is certified as sustainable by the @entity118
the @entity119 in @entity120 -- which , despite its sizable distance from @entity15 , has an exhibit that features orangutans -- created a list of candies that do and do n't contain palm oil and published it on its website
the list , which i did not confirm independently , says @entity129 , snickers and @entity131 , all made by @entity133 , contain " non-sustainable " palm oil
" @entity133 is committed to working with the broader community towards 100 % traceable sources of palm oil that are free of deforestation , expansion on carbon - rich peatlands , and the violation of human and labor rights , " the company said in an e-mail
@entity133 added that it will use 100 % sustainable - certified palm oil by the end of the year
industry groups and others say palm oil can be grown sustainably , is healthier than alternatives and can be grown on relatively smaller plots of land
some animal and forest advocates say that 's not enough
the only way to pressure candy makers to make their supply chains transparent and to stop clearing rain forest for palm oil plantation is to boycott all the candies and snack foods that contain palm oil , said @entity167 , the @entity119 's director
" the issue has been identified
there is an industry that is doing this -- and this industry is being supported by consumers simply because of ignorance , " he told me
" they just do n't know any better
we 're trying to do the dolphin - safe tuna thing
" maybe candy is the new tuna
but figuring out how to avoid palm oil , which shows up in many products , is more difficult than picking a dolphin - safe tuna brand
technology makes it a bit easier
the @entity119 sponsored a new app -- called @entity188 , and available for free on @entity189 and @entity190 -- that lets consumers scan product bar codes to determine if a particular candy contains palm oil
the app , like the zoo , says consumers should not buy products that contain the oil , whether it is certified as sustainable or not
the sustainability label is not enough to ensure orangutan habitat is not being harmed , according to @entity167
the app seems like a useful tool , especially considering the nuances involved
@entity206 can morph into more than a dozen names in the ingredients lists on the backs of product
@entity211 , sodium lauryl sulphate and @entity213 ( palm kernel oil )
all are versions of " palm oil , " according to advocates
meanwhile , many candy brands sell some products that contain palm oil and others that do n't
it 's a mess to get up to speed
and it would be expecting a miracle to think even a savvy shopper could remember it all
the @entity37 says a boycott goes too far
the important thing is that companies make their supply chains transparent and root out problems
the group asks citizens to send e-mails to food companies urging them to " demand responsible palm oil from ( their ) suppliers and eliminate conflict palm oil contamination of ( their ) products
" whatever your view , there 's no need to skip the sweets on @entity4
but -- whether it 's through a boycott or uploading a photo -- use this holiday to spread the word about the connection we all have to an endangered species
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity259 .
