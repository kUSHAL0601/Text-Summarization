@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a game most @entity4 play in their basements
but competitive table tennis is a different story
in fact , it 's an @entity10 sport , and the @entity4 has a bright , new star representing @entity12 in @entity13 : 16 - year - old @entity11
@entity11 's parents , @entity15 and @entity16 , immigrants to the @entity4 , play table tennis
when her mother could n't find a baby sitter , she brought a then 7 - year - old @entity19 along with her when playing at table tennis clubs
it was there that @entity11 discovered her love for the sport and her talent
" i love table tennis , and i love playing
i love to practice so i just kept practicing and there were tournaments along the way , but it just kind of happened gradually , " said @entity11
@entity31 : get involved with the @entity10 " i never thought for one minute : ' ok , i am just going to dedicate my life to table tennis
' i really love it , and i 'm really passionate about it so i just keep wanting to do it
" while other elite athletes focus solely on their sport and winning @entity10 gold , @entity11 is a junior at @entity40 in @entity0 with college on the horizon
she aspires to attend @entity43
@entity11 understands that table tennis is not as popular other @entity10 sports and does n't bring in the same kind of endorsements and money
she must split her focus between athletics and academics
to achieve success on the table and in the classroom , @entity11 has a regimented schedule
" i wake up at around 7 a.m. i 'll go practice serves for half an hour , and then i 'll start getting ready for school
my dad will drive me to school
after my classes , he 'll pick me up with lunch and he 'll drive me to a nearby club
" and after i eat my lunch i 'll usually take a nap in the car
and once i get there , at the club , i 'll train for two to three hours and he 'll drive me to another club and there i 'll play another two hours , then i 'll come home , eat dinner , do homework , and i 'll finally get to sleep , " @entity11 said
@entity75 names two women to @entity10 team all of the practice is necessary as @entity11 notes her sport goes well beyond a friendly game of ping - pong
" i think ping - pong is the kind of game that everyone loves to play
a lot of people have their table in their basement at home , and they just play around for fun but competitive table tennis is really different
" it 's not just about your arm , but you have to move your legs so much , it can be really tiring and when you 're actually playing a match , it 's just like a chess game
you have to beat the opponent mentally while they 're trying to change their strategies , " she said
@entity11 's made several sacrifices to get her to her first @entity10 , such as adjusting her diet
" i 've had to give up a lot of food for table tennis
i really love to eat , and i love to eat anything unhealthy , anything that will give you a heart attack , those are my foods , so i 've had to give up a lot of those in order to maintain a good athletic shape
" with her intense schedule , @entity11 has also sacrificed time hanging out with friends , but she 's also gained a notable new friend : @entity122
she met @entity122 when she was 9 on @entity122 's 75th birthday
@entity122 received a table tennis lesson as a gift , and the local coach thought it be fun to bring a young phenom along to assist in the lesson
@entity11 made such an impression on @entity122 that he remains one of her biggest fans
@entity122 offers her advice , encouragement and is a constant cheerleader , even watching her matches online from his office
" @entity138 has just been so supportive of me
when i was playing the finals of the @entity10 trials , he was there in his office , cheering for me , and everyone in his office did n't know what was going on
so that was really funny , " @entity11 said
she is appreciative of this special bond with @entity122 , and it 's clear the influence he 's had on her
she hopes to major in business in college
but she says the best advice he 's given her was n't something he said but rather something she learned by example
" he 's just been so humble and just so down to earth , and i think that 's really admirable , and i really want to be like that
" as she excitedly heads off to @entity13 , @entity11 remains grounded in what her role is
she takes representing her country very seriously , but she also knows she bears a responsibility as a role model
" i would just tell people to always fight for their dreams and just try really , really hard to go for it
because when i was 8 years old , i had a dream of making the @entity10 one day
i wrote this down on a little piece of paper , and i rolled it up and i put it in this little box
... i convinced myself if i opened that piece of paper , my wish would not come true
so it 's just been sitting in my room , and it 's been a constant reminder of my dream and a constant reminder of what i was working for
