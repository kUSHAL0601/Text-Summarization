@entity0 -- @entity5 's november 9 independence referendum will not be held as planned due to the suspension of the vote by @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity3 president @entity2 announced tuesday in @entity10
@entity2 said the decree he recently signed authorizing the referendum " now has no effect , " given that the @entity8 has accepted the @entity9 government 's appeal for study , automatically suspending the vote
the @entity9 government , in appealing to the @entity8 , said the @entity3 vote as planned for november 9 was unconstitutional because the constitution holds that all of @entity9 , not just one region such as @entity5 , must decide on the country 's future
@entity26 independence vote closely watched hundreds of thousands of @entity3 have demonstrated in recent years for an independence referendum , and they closely watched the recent independence vote in @entity26
even after @entity26 voted to remain a part of the @entity31 , many @entity3 said the key issue was being able to vote in @entity5 on independence , which the @entity9 government has opposed
@entity2 said there will still be a vote on november 9 , but it will be organized by the @entity3 government under @entity3 legislation that has not been blocked by the court
it will be called a " consultation , " and will be conducted by volunteers , not the usual electoral officials
and the polling places will be only in @entity3 regional government buildings , not at numerous other sites , such as at city halls , many of which had opposed the referendum
unity in question @entity2 said the @entity3 political parties -- including his nationalist @entity53 -- that had favored the referendum and independence are no longer as united as they recently were on the issue
leftist pro-independence parties have insisted that the november 9 referendum be held as planned , despite the court 's ruling , and some have called for a unilateral declaration of independence
on september 11 , @entity3 national day , hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of @entity10 for the third year in a row , demanding a vote on independence be held
self - governance but @entity0 argues that @entity5 , which represents one fifth of @entity9 's economy , already has broad home - rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health
and it insists that the @entity9 @entity80 does not allow any of @entity9 's 17 regions to unilaterally break away
@entity5 is a region of northeastern @entity9 , with @entity10 -- the second - largest city in @entity9 -- as its capital
if there is eventually a referendum , voters are expected to be asked a two - part question : " @entity88 be a state ? " and those who vote yes to that can then vote on the second question : " should that state be independent ? " polls indicate that a majority of @entity3 want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence , given the chance .
