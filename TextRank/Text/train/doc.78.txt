-- @entity2 's deputy chief justice recently made the alarming announcement that his government might start training judges to cut off the hands and legs of convicted criminals , if doctors refuse to carry out amputations as punishment
@entity12 said non-cooperation over the use of such amputations would be punished
adopting a defiant posture , he denied his government had ever stopped the use of one of the most severe forms of " hudud " punishments , which are based on an interpretation of islamic law
@entity12 revealed that 16 people had been subjected to amputations since 2001 , although the first reported case was that of @entity26 , 30 , whose right hand and left foot were amputated by three doctors on 14 february
@entity30 had been found guilty of highway robbery
the amputation prompted a public outcry , particularly by the @entity34 , which complained that doctors were horrified to have to break the @entity36 -- to protect patients , and not harm them -- in order to comply with government orders
amputations are just one form of cruel punishment carried out in @entity2
since 2005 thousands have been sentenced on counts of adultery , which carries the punishment of flogging , and , in some cases , stoning
@entity49 was 23 years old and the mother of a six - month - old infant when she was sentenced to death by stoning on counts of adultery by a @entity2 judge last july
he did n't mind that she did n't have a lawyer to defend herself , or that she did n't understand what " stoning " meant
the second woman to be sentenced to death by stoning in 2012 , she spent two months shackled , alone with her baby , in @entity63 prison , near the capital @entity65
both women were eventually released on appeal , following intense campaigns by @entity2 and international human rights organizations on their behalf
others , though , are less fortunate
almost every day in @entity2 , someone is given 20 to 100 lashes on a court order for minor offenses , and following a summary trial
many such floggings are carried out in public
these punishments are cruel , inhuman , degrading and may amount to torture
they are a clear violation of international human rights law and @entity2 's own international commitments , notably the @entity85
they are highly controversial within @entity2 , which explains in part why the authorities have been unable to enforce them systematically
but for those affected , the suffering is real -- and revolting
as @entity2 reviews its constitution , it is imperative that the authorities respect their international commitments , and address the issue of corporal punishments and the death penalty as a matter of priority
such cruel punishments can no longer be tolerated
and laws need to be enforced and respected to put an end to them once and for all
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity108 .
