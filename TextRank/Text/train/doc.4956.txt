@entity0 -- for several fear - filled minutes last friday , three passengers on board @entity3 flight 2332 in @entity5 called emergency dispatchers to report a flight attendant 's apparent meltdown , asking for help and trying to make sense of her strange rant
the flight , which was on the ground , never took off , and no passengers were hurt
but the 911 calls , released tuesday , show the mutual confusion of the callers and the 911 dispatchers as they tried to piece together information , which was sparse on both sides of the phone line
" we 're on flight 2332 and , um , they 're talking over the radio about crashing our plane , " the first caller , a woman , told the emergency dispatcher
" ok , who is talking about crashing your plane ? " the dispatcher asked
" the attendants , over the @entity36 , " the caller said
" obviously perplexed , and wanting to confirm the bizarre report , the dispatcher repeated the information
" you 're currently on board the flight , and the attendants are announcing over the @entity44 ... " " yes , " the caller interjected
" ... that they 're going to crash the plane ? " the dispatcher asked
" yes , " the caller said
" did they say why ? " " no , " the caller answered
the dispatcher implored the caller not to hang up , asked for her name and phone number , and asked precisely what the flight attendant said
" her specific words were , ' this plane is not going to take off before it crashes , ' " the passenger said
a second female passenger called , and the dispatcher told her help was on the way
" listen , we 've got people that are coming to you
i need you to give me some information so you can help me fill them in , ok ? " the dispatcher said
" ( you are ) going to be ok
as long as that plane does n't take off , you are still fine
you are still on the ground , right ? " the passenger confirmed the plane was still on the ground and said a passenger in the back of the plane had just gone up front
" ok , do n't be alarmed
he may be a sky marshal , " the dispatcher said
" they fly armed and they are in plainclothes
so do n't be alarmed
" the man , it was later learned , was another passenger who helped detain the flight attendant
the third 911 caller , a man , asked " are you all aware of what 's going on on flight 2332 right now ? " " it looks like they 're physically restraining a flight attendant , " he said
" she 's lost it
" finally , another call came from the airport control tower , saying the matter was nearing a resolution
" @entity102 returning to the gate
fight being reported , " the control tower official reported
friday morning 's event at @entity107 was a rare disruption blamed on a flight attendant , but did not appear to involve any criminal intent
local and federal officials said they had not filed charges against the airline employee , adding to speculation she had suffered a mental breakdown
one passenger later told @entity1 the flight attendant appeared confused even before the flight pulled away from the gate
the passenger said she overheard the flight attendant say she was bipolar and had not taken her medication
as the plane taxied towards the runway , the flight attendant made references to needing to perform " cross-checks , " and then appeared to be attempting to reach the pilots
unable to reach the pilots , she announced on the plane 's public address system that she was no longer responsible for the safety of the aircraft and that it might crash
fellow crew members scuffled with the woman for control of the microphone , and passengers moved in to restrain her
the flight attendant and a colleague were taken to a hospital for treatment , @entity3 said .
