-- @entity1 produced a memorable performance after his four - goal salvo helped @entity4 defeat @entity5 in @entity6
the 31 - year - old , who has scored ten goals in as many games for club side @entity10 , was on fire once again as @entity13 's men were swept away
the @entity15 skipper had given his side a 20th minute lead before goals from @entity20 's @entity19 and @entity22 's @entity21 gave @entity5 a half - time
@entity1 arrival marks watershed moment for @entity10 but it was @entity1 who stole the show after the interval , with three strikes in the final 12 minutes
after netting a 78th minute equaliser , @entity1 slammed home a rasping 30 - yard free - kick before rounding off his night with a scarcely believable scissors kick
it ruined the night for @entity5 captain @entity35 , who had hoped to celebrate his 100th cap with victory
@entity35 told @entity46 1 : " i still stick by @entity47 , he is the best player in the world as the best player of his generation , but his ( @entity1 's ) performance was world class and he just scored one of the best goals i seen live
" it was his night
if someone scores four goals and the way he scored them ...
it 's one of the best i 've seen
" @entity13 added : " the fourth goal was extraordinary , but it was the second and third goals which cost us
" for 70 minutes we were playing very well and we deserved to be in the lead , but we made changes and they took the initiative
" elsewhere , @entity61 recorded an impressive 2 - 1 victory over @entity63 after it came from behind in @entity64
@entity66 star @entity65 gave the hosts the lead only for @entity61 to hit back through @entity69 and @entity70
the highly anticipated grudge match between the @entity72 and @entity73 failed to catch light as it finished goalless in @entity75
@entity76 passes @entity78 's goal milestone @entity76 drew a rare blank after @entity80 was held to a goalless draw by @entity82
despite boasting the likes of @entity84 and @entity85 in their starting line - up , @entity80 were unable to make the breakthrough against a stubborn @entity82 defence
@entity89 scored a late equalizer as the @entity91 grabbed a 2 - 2 draw in @entity93
@entity94 had given the hosts a ninth minute lead before @entity98 's fine effort brought the @entity91 level
@entity100 looked to have won the contest with an 84th minute penalty but @entity103 fired home late on to ensure the game finished level
elsewhere , @entity108 was held to a 2 - 2 draw in @entity110 , @entity107 defeated @entity111 3 - 1 and @entity112 claimed a 1 - 0 win over the @entity114 .
