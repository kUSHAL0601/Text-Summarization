@entity0 -- @entity2 is a self - described assassin for the @entity5 government
he says he has fired on unarmed protesters , killed as many as 70 people and once slit a man 's throat
it was kill or be killed , he says ; @entity12 says he was simply carrying out orders
he says he worked at an @entity15 prison , and " we would go out with the officers from the prisons
... they gave us guns with scopes and you see the body as if you 're looking at yourself in the mirror
" @entity12 agreed to be filmed by @entity1 as his wounds were treated by opposition activists
he said he was on a bus that was ambushed by unknown assailants
he asked that his identify be obscured enough so that the government ca n't recognize him but said he wanted his friends to know that he is alive -- and a changed man
out of fear , his captors keep @entity2 blindfolded
members of the opposition intend to trade him for other men in custody , and they do n't want him to be able to identify them down the road
he is a bargaining chip
@entity1 could not independently confirm the man 's story , nor was it possible to know whether he had been coerced into telling it
" i ca n't untie your eyes because i am afraid of you , " @entity45 , a member of the opposition , tells @entity12
" why are you doing this ? why are you killing us ? " @entity45 demands , his gun nearby
@entity12 tells @entity45 about a time two police officers captured a man
a major put a gun to @entity12 's head and ordered him to kill the prisoner , he says
" he said , ' i am going to count to 10
' he cocked the gun , fired into the air and put it to my head again
i slaughtered him , " @entity12 says
the government turned him and others like him into monsters who would have killed their own fathers , he claims
they were promised wealth and told they were helping to fight terrorists , he says
for close to a year , the @entity5 government has sustained a brutal crackdown on protesters seeking to oust president @entity76
the government claims its security forces are battling terrorists
the @entity79 estimates that at least 5,400 people have been killed , while an opposition group says more than 7,000 people have died
each side is fighting for the future of @entity0 , and with each death , is growing more and more entrenched
still , perhaps , there is a space for change -- or maybe , just an apparent change of heart for a man being held against his will
" these guys i am with , i used to see them in a different light , " @entity12 says about his captors
" since i have been with them , i have seen only good
