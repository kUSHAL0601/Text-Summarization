an @entity1 prosecutor said friday there is enough evidence to continue an investigation into whether president @entity6 hid @entity8 's alleged role in a deadly 1994 bombing , a probe that paused after a different prosecutor died mysteriously last month
federal prosecutor @entity12 filed a 61 - page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor @entity14 claimed before he died in january : that evidence shows @entity16 and other top officials tried to cover up @entity8 's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a @entity22 center in @entity23
@entity12 sent his report to a judge , who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation
the judge can determine whether the case can proceed to trial
@entity14 , a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the @entity32 , alleged last month that @entity8 was behind the attack , and that @entity16 , to help sweeten a trade deal , covered up @entity36 's involvement
that trade deal , @entity14 alleged , involved cash - strapped @entity1 receiving @entity8 oil in exchange for meat and grain
@entity14 made the allegation in a nearly 300 - page report
but on january 18 , one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations , he was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head
@entity14 filled with fear before his death , friend says in his trash can , investigators say , was a 6 - month - old draft warrant for @entity16 's arrest
@entity16 initially called it a suicide , but a test found no gunpowder residue on @entity14 's hands
@entity16 said a few days later that she did n't believe @entity14 killed himself , alleging that some members of the country 's intelligence agency fed @entity14 false information about a cover - up and were responsible for his death
the president and the other accused government officials deny any cover - up in the bombing
@entity16 , the president 's general secretary , said the allegations against @entity16 are " a clear maneuver to destabilize democracy " in the @entity76 country
he also said the investigation lacks " judicial value " or " importance
" about 10 years ago , @entity14 was appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the bombing by then - president @entity82 , @entity16 's late husband
conspiracy theories aplenty in wake of prosecutor 's death @entity2 's @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 contributed to this report .
