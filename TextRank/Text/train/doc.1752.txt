@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 leftist leader @entity3 on tuesday laid out the radical agenda he hopes to pursue if he becomes prime minister , including the cancellation of severe budget - cutting measures forced on the country by international lenders
laws that cut pensions and salaries and those that " cancel basic workers ' rights " must be annulled , @entity3 said as he started efforts to form a governing coalition in the wake of sunday 's parliamentary elections
he also called for state control of the banks , which " remain in the hands of the managers who bankrupted the system , " he said
the @entity0 people voted clearly to reject the austerity demanded by international lenders , said @entity3 , leader of the @entity28
the two parties that made the agreement with international lenders " do n't have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the @entity0 people , " @entity3 told lawmakers
he said he was planning to meet the leaders of those parties wednesday but called on @entity36 of @entity37 and @entity38 of @entity39 to renounce publicly the deal they made with international lenders before then
@entity38 said what @entity3 was proposing would result in @entity0 exiting the eurozone , and that the @entity28 leader was doing everything possible to ensure no government would be formed
@entity36 said @entity37 would not form a coalition with @entity28 , as the party would only participate in a coalition government that would secure @entity0 's position in the eurozone
@entity0 media reported that @entity3 was preparing to send a letter to the @entity53 , but it was not immediately known what he planned to say
@entity3 met @entity0 president @entity56 earlier tuesday to get instructions to try to cobble together a government in the wake of elections that left the country 's political system in chaos
@entity28 will have three days to form a government
@entity67 leader @entity66 spoke with @entity3 by phone but will not meet him , @entity65 said
@entity70 of the @entity71 , which splintered from @entity28 in 2010 , told @entity3 that when they met tuesday @entity28 needed the support of more than just the left , @entity3 ' bloc said
the @entity74 also rejected @entity28 's approach for support tuesday , saying a road map to exit the crisis was needed
@entity28 came in second in the elections , in which seven parties got seats in parliament and no party captured more than 19 % of the vote
the @entity0 stock market dropped about 5 % in early trading before recovering somewhat tuesday
the market had fallen more than 6 % monday
the @entity0 elections came the same day that @entity91 voters kicked out president @entity92 in favor of @entity94 , who spoke out against austerity in his victory speech sunday
the failure of @entity0 's main center - right party to form a coalition government monday added yet more uncertainty to the debt - ridden country 's political situation
@entity39 leader @entity38 said he did " everything possible " to form a coalition , but none of the parties agreed to join with his party , which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in sunday 's parliamentary elections
politicians have until may 17 to come up with a new working alliance or , if they can not , set a date for another round of elections
@entity28 more than tripled its parliamentary representation to 51 seats out of 300 in the balloting
@entity3 left little doubt sunday about what direction his party would take in a new government
" @entity125 leadership and especially ( @entity127 chancellor @entity126 have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat , " @entity3 said
he called the election results " a message of a peaceful revolution
" the election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in @entity0
a @entity138 spokeswoman said monday that @entity0 needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country 's leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown
" the commission hopes and expects that the future government of @entity0 will respect the engagements that @entity0 has entered into , " spokeswoman @entity145 told reporters
@entity39 finished first in sunday 's voting but ended up with only 108 seats in @entity0 's 300 - seat parliament
voters also delivered a rebuke to @entity37 -- @entity39 's socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government -- stripping the party of 119 seats
together , the parties fell short of the 50 % necessary to continue the coalition , requiring formation of a new government
last year , @entity0 's debt threatened to force it to drop @entity125 's common currency , the euro , prompting the @entity166 and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding
in exchange , they demanded that the government slash spending
the resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs , wages , pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry
the national unemployment rate for january , the latest month for which figures are available , was nearly 22 % , prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work
youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work
for two years , the country 's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17 - country eurozone
@entity0 pushed through a huge debt swap in march to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the @entity53 , the @entity166 and the @entity198 , worth â ‚ ¬ 130 billion ( $ 171.5 billion )
the debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc , where fears that @entity0 might collapse had increased pressure on other debt - laden nations such as @entity209 and @entity210
the tribulations of @entity39 and @entity37 were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also - rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago , propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures
@entity2 's @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .
