@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's baaaaack
the defiant and combative @entity4 that reporters knew from the past returned in full spring bloom on friday , now that a report he commissioned cleared him of wrongdoing in the @entity11 lane closure controversy
a few minutes into his first news conference in more than two months , @entity1 's @entity13 governor flashed his famous cantankerousness at suggestions he was hiding something about the apparently politically motivated traffic jams last september in @entity19
" colorful , " he interjected as one journalist asked an extended question
" can you get to it already ? " later , he cut off a reporter to complain she was wrong about the timing of events in december
" stop , " he said , insisting that " you have to get the facts right if you 're going to ask the question
" when the journalist persisted , @entity4 cut in with " excuse me , excuse me " and then moved on by saying " the premise of the question is so infirm i 'm not going to answer it
" @entity4 's feisty approach had been missing of late , especially during his previous news conference in january that lasted almost two hours as the governor faced questions about the scandal labeled @entity37 by @entity39 foes
separate federal and state investigations continue , but the report released this week found no evidence that @entity4 was involved in possible political retribution against @entity19 's @entity39 mayor for not endorsing his re-election
@entity4 holds first news conference in two months @entity4 called the report exhaustive while critics labeled it a whitewash
regardless of perspective , it gave @entity4 renewed vigor to face public questioning on the issue during friday 's news conference that lasted just over an hour
the return of his trademark gruffness provides multiple benefits for @entity4 , who easily won re-election last year in traditionally @entity39 @entity1 and now has possible ambitions for the @entity13 presidential nomination in 2016
he tightly managed friday 's news conference , basically telling journalists that he did n't care if they liked his answers or not
more importantly , his tough tactics play well among media - hating conservatives he will need to win the @entity13 nomination two years from now , if he runs
some on the political right mistrust @entity4 because of moderate positions on issues such as gay marriage , as well as his public support for president @entity78 as they toured the damage from @entity81 days before @entity78 's reelection in 2012
" now that he 's been self - exonerated , it appears that he 's decided to dispense with his faux humility of the past few months , " @entity84 spokesman @entity83 said of the governor
one particularly heated exchange involved @entity90 , his former deputy chief of staff whose now - infamous email " time for some traffic problems in @entity19 " propelled what was a little noticed local controversy into an outright political crisis for the governor
@entity4 said he canned @entity90 for lying to him , and he decided against meeting with her before the firing to avoid any perception of coercion or intimidation on the matter
when a reporter persisted on the topic , @entity4 exploded at the premise of the question
" i do n't know whether you ca n't take notes or you 're not listening , but for you to characterize my last answer that i did n't want to ask her because i did n't want to know is so awful that it is beneath the job you hold , " he said
@entity4 saved his best for last , concluding the more than hour - long session by sarcastically telling reporters " it 's such a joy and relief to be finally able to come back and interact with you in the kind and gentle way we always have
" " i 'd love to say i missed you , " he added , " but i did n't
" @entity2 's @entity123 reported from @entity0 for this story , which was written by @entity125 in @entity126 .
