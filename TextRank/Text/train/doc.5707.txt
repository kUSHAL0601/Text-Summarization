-- yes , a pope can resign but it has n't happened for nearly 600 years
the surprising news from @entity4 monday leaves the church and the world in unfamiliar , but not entirely uncharted , territory
the last time a pope resigned was in 1415 , when pope @entity9 resigned during the worst institutional crisis in the church 's history
called the @entity14 , there were not only three popes but three colleges of cardinals competing for allegiance
@entity9 's heroic stepping down helped the church heal at a critical moment
it is quite likely that @entity23 's shocking move will help burnish his reputation in the long run
his papacy has been a bumpy one , marked by poor communication among his @entity30 staff , and with the church at large
certainly his controversial wording about @entity33 in his speech at @entity35 in 2006 was an example of a scholar pope unable to reach a mass audience , especially when compared to the media maestro @entity37 all sorts of internal curial squabbling marked what was supposed to be a @entity44 housecleaning by a @entity46 administrator who did n't turn out to be up to that task
pope @entity23 's statement in full this pope will go down in history in the line of scholar popes more interested in high - end theology than modern evangelism
but that should not be seen as a criticism even though anyone elected after the superstar @entity37 was destined -- perhaps doomed -- to seem smaller compared to such a giant
all eras of church histories have seen different popes for different times , so perhaps what the church needed was a quiet pope after a boisterous papacy
yet the introverted pope who played @entity68 seemed unable to hit the right note when it came to addressing the major issue of the last decade : the priest sex abuse scandal and the related problem of bishops who protected predators
this makes for a decidedly mixed verdict -- at least today
@entity77 : what do you think ? the precedents to his surprise move are few.the first pope to resign was @entity84 , in 235 , when @entity85 was still an illegal religion in the @entity87
he was deported from @entity4 to @entity88 to a prison known for its brutality
since he knew he would die there , he resigned so a successor would be in place
the pope 's @entity46 roots the most famous resignation is @entity97 in 1294
a hermit , totally unsuited to the politics of the medieval papal court , he resigned after less than half a year in office
@entity102 famously put @entity103 for his " great refusal " or , in @entity106 , il gran rifiuto
so why is pope @entity23 resigning ? it seems , like @entity97 and maybe even @entity108 , that @entity23 was never quite comfortable as pope
it could be that this very traditional man is setting a helpful precedent for modern medical times , and making papal resignations easier in the future due to ill health
@entity23 may have simply come to the moment where he realized he could n't do the job any more
unlike @entity37 , who decided to stay in the job , @entity23 is offering a different model
pope @entity23 will surely retire quietly to a @entity122 monastery to keep writing , the life he imagined for himself before his election
abuse mars legacy the question now is what authority does have an ex-pope have
when he renounces the papal throne , he no longer has papal authority
@entity23 must be very careful not to interfere or to answer the inevitable phone calls when his successor makes a move that appears different from the one he would have made
to interfere would be out of character , so it seems likely that this careful theologian and prototypical company man will go gently into that good night
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144
