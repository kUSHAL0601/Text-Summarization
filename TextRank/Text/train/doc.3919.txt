-- the @entity2 could perhaps ' @entity1 ' to hit the skins after their drummer 's surgery forced the band to delay its march tour of @entity8 and @entity9
" @entity12 regret to advise that the @entity2 tour has been postponed from march 2011 to november 2011 to allow drummer @entity2 to recover from surgery for a torn right labrum and bicep , " @entity11 's website said
" a new itinerary is currently being secured for november in @entity8 and will be advised to fans this week
ticket holders should hold on to their tickets until further notice
" @entity23 issued an apology through his @entity26 account
" sorry to all the fans in @entity8 and @entity9 , " @entity23 tweeted
" my bum wing needs more time to heal but we 'll be back later this year
" brother and lead singer @entity2 -- suddenly with time to kill -- asked for suggestions on his @entity26 account
" well , i now have march off , " he tweeted
" any ideas for fun ? i could always fly down to @entity8 and party anyway
i need some sun. " this is the second time the band has run into problems during its global tour to promote their latest album " @entity43
" the band 's tour bus caught on fire at the @entity47 in @entity48 just before @entity49
and last week , @entity2 got into a media shouting match of sorts with the creator of the hit tv show " @entity56
" in an interview with the @entity60 , the show 's creator @entity57 said he 's miffed at the rockers for refusing to let the cast sing the hit " @entity1 " on the show
" f -- you , @entity2 , " @entity57 says in a tirade against the band
" they 're self - centered a- -- s , and they missed the big picture
they missed that a 7 - year - old kid can see someone close to their age singing a @entity2 song , which will maybe make them want to join a glee club or pick up a musical instrument
" " this whole ' @entity56 ' thing is a shock to us
it 's gotten out of hand , " guitarist @entity2 told @entity0 in a statement
" at the time of the request , we had n't even seen the show
it came at the end of that record cycle , and we were over promoting ( the song ) , " @entity2 said
" this was never meant as a slap in the face to ' glee ' or to music education or to fans of the show
we 're not sure where the anger is coming from
we just said no to a license for a tv show , which we do a lot
" the @entity2 has achieved tremendous success in recent years , scoring a multi-platinum album and several hit singles with their 2008 album " only by the @entity110
