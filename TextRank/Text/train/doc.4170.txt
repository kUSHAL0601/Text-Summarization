-- a man suspected in a series of stabbings and carjackings in @entity6 was charged sunday night with the murders of four people , authorities said
@entity12 was arraigned in @entity13 on four counts of murder , one count of attempted murder , one count of assault , two counts of robbery and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon , @entity11 district attorney 's office spokesman @entity9 said
he will be back in court monday , at which point he 'll have a lawyer appointed for him , according to @entity9
as he was led away from @entity11 's 61st precinct to an awaiting police cruiser earlier sunday , @entity12 was deluged with questions from gathered media and hostile shouts from the crowd
after uttering an expletive , he said , " this was a set - up , man
" authorities said saturday that @entity12 allegedly stabbed three people to death , hit and killed a man with a car , slashed at least five other people and carjacked two vehicles before he was wrestled to the ground early saturday while attempting to break into the cab of a subway car
@entity12 , 23 , who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist , was arrested about 9 a.m. saturday , about 28 hours after he allegedly began the spree spanning three @entity6 boroughs , police commissioner @entity47 said
" it 's so horrendous and bizarre , " @entity47 told reporters saturday
" we have no reason that we can give you as to why he did this
" police said @entity12 got into a dispute with his mother at her @entity11 home about 5 a.m. friday after she refused to let him take her 2004 gray @entity62
the suspect 's stepfather , @entity63 , intervened and was stabbed 11 times
@entity63 , 54 , died , while @entity12 's mother -- who survived unscathed -- alerted authorities
investigators believe @entity12 then took the @entity62 , drove about a mile away to the home of his ex-girlfriend and allegedly stabbed her mother , 56 - year - old @entity72 , 11 times , at about 10:30 a.m. @entity12 's former girlfriend found her mother dead on the floor when she returned home at about 4:15 p.m. , police said
but in the short period before they arrived , authorities believe @entity12 -- who presumably was still in the apartment -- allegedly attacked the former girlfriend , 20 - year - old @entity81 , with a knife
he chased her into the street and killed her , also slashing the jacket sleeve of a passerby trying to stop him , authorities said
he then left the scene in the @entity62 and rear - ended another car , a @entity91 , allegedly stabbing its 60 - year - old driver in the shoulder and neck in a confrontation and then leaving the scene in that car , police said
authorities said they later found four kitchen knives in the @entity62
the @entity91 driver was in stable condition as of saturday , recovering from three stab wounds , @entity47 said
about 4:25 p.m. , @entity12 allegedly struck a pedestrian about two miles away , @entity47 said
@entity104 , 60 , died of his injuries
police believe the suspect eventually abandoned the @entity91 , which was later found near a @entity11 railroad line he was known to frequent as a graffiti artist
shortly before 1 a.m. saturday , @entity12 allegedly got into a cab in @entity11 and stabbed the driver
as of saturday , that driver was in stable condition
@entity47 said @entity12 then got out of the car and confronted a couple , allegedly stabbing a man in the hands and taking his car keys
that man was treated and released at a hospital , @entity47 said
the car , a @entity122 , was later found in @entity123
@entity124 told reporters he was that victim
" he looked crazy , " he said of the suspect
" he looked like a crazy guy
" he said the suspect pulled a knife and a gun and told him to get out of the car or he would kill him
" i was shocked , " he said
" i did n't know what to do
" but he said he decided to fight , and moved over into the passenger seat
" i was trying to kick him to get him out
" but he said the man forced his way in and hit the gas
@entity124 said he was holding on to the man 's hands as he tried to stab him
police received a tip saturday morning that @entity12 might have been riding a southbound subway train in @entity144
a woman approached police at a subway stop and said @entity12 knocked a newspaper featuring his picture from her hands and said to her , " do you believe what they 're writing about me ? " before crossing the tracks and jumping onto a train
the suspect stabbed another passenger -- a 40 - year - old man , whom @entity12 did n't appear to know -- in the head and neck sometime during his time onboard , @entity47 said
that male subway passenger was in stable condition sunday
eventually , the suspect worked his way to the front cab of the train
the commissioner said @entity12 pounded on the cab 's door , yelling " police " -- apparently trying to get in , by claiming he was a police officer
he did not appear to know two transit police officers , later identified as @entity170 and @entity171 , were inside the cab with the train 's operator
soon after , the officers -- with aid from off - duty @entity6 police @entity177
@entity180 and an unnamed civilian nearby -- wrestled @entity12 to the ground
no one was hurt in that scuffle , during which a knife fell to the ground
police also found @entity12 had another , smaller , knife when they detained him
he also had what @entity47 described as a " significant amount of money
" @entity47 said the suspect was mostly " incoherent " after being arrested , besides a statement that " she had to die
" the commissioner said he did not know if " she " referred to ex-girlfriend @entity81 , her mother or someone else
@entity47 said @entity12 had 10 previous arrests , mostly for drug charges and graffiti , plus one robbery charge
his most recent arrest was january 26 , when he was accused of possessing crack cocaine
for roughly the past seven years , @entity12 has been a naturalized @entity206 citizen
he arrived in this country with his father and mother in 1992 from his native @entity210
