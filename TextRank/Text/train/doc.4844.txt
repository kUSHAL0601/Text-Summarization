-- last week , in a segment called " @entity4 " on @entity0 's " @entity3 , " @entity1 begged @entity5 to end its love affair with the 1980s
he expressed his disappointment in the fact that not only did " @entity12 " earn $ 35 million at the box office opening weekend , but a sequel is already in the works
referring to @entity5 's vision as " backward , " @entity1 said that the movie industry relies too heavily upon familiar characters and plot lines in order to tap into that " quaint nostalgia factor ... that drives all @entity20 candidates to try and prove they 're the most like @entity21
" @entity1 predicted that if the trend did n't stop soon , in 30 years he 'd be forced to endure " @entity23 : @entity24 " or " @entity25 " in @entity26
but what about the people who grew up in the ' 80s and watched movies and tv shows about the ' 50s and ' 60s , such as " @entity33 " and " @entity34 " ? @entity35 , editor at @entity36 , told @entity0 that ' 80s movies waxed nostalgic about the ' 50s " because the directors then grew up in the ' 50s and were starting to come of age and have real power in @entity5
" today , history is repeating itself
now the people who grew up in the ' 80s are the @entity5 heavyweights green lighting projects
" if you were a young , naive child in the ' 80s like i was , " said @entity35 , " you thought of @entity21 and jellybeans when you thought of the ' 80s
you did n't really understand the things that you understand when you 're an adult
" @entity35 , 33 , pointed out that people , like she , who were small children in the ' 80s were " too young to know that there were good and bad things to pop culture " because they had n't reached that age of awareness yet , so as far as they were concerned , " everything was super awesome
" @entity35 suggested that maybe @entity1 , whose 47th birthday is today , ca n't relate because he had already reached that " awareness " age by the ' 80s
" we have such a fondness for it , " said @entity35 , " but it 's because that was a time of pure , unfiltered , uncynical enjoyment of pop culture
" @entity35 suggested that her generation is coming of age in terms of power , whereas perhaps the generation ahead feels a little insecure
remember , while a lot of ' 80s films were throwbacks to the 20 - 30 years before , the ' 90s and early 2000s were dotted with ' 70s remakes and re-imaginings , such as " @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " anchorman " ( by the way , @entity89 's coming back -- a sequel was announced earlier this week ) and tv 's " @entity91
" that generation wanted to distance itself from the ' 80s in a lot of ways , and people once again started wearing bell - bottoms and boot - cut jeans
@entity35 , who noted that she 's beginning to age out of the demographic that @entity5 is targeting , said it 's easy to feel neglected
@entity102 , executive producer at @entity103 , agrees with @entity1 and also thinks @entity5 needs to generate some new material
people " go for the warm , " but at the same time audiences have wised up , said @entity102 , who noted that " footloose , " for example , bombed at the box office
@entity102 is also averse to @entity5 's turning old tv shows -- not just " @entity12 " -- into movies
he said that audiences may get excited when they see the poster , but for the most part it insults their intelligence
@entity102 calls " @entity12 " a remake " in name only
" it would n't necessarily be associated with the original tv series , save for the cameos
for one thing , the movie is a comedy ; the series was a drama
it appears there are two camps on how to approach and appreciate remakes : some want literal interpretations that serve as amped - up versions of the originals ( e.g. " @entity134 " ) , and others prefer movies like " @entity12 , " which barely resemble their yesteryear counterparts
@entity35 lsaid that for a remake to work it needs " some sort of meta - element or link
" she said that , while she thought @entity5 butchered " @entity144 " -- because @entity143 can not be replaced -- she has high hopes for a potential " @entity146
" " if you 're gon na remake @entity149 , i would like not just for @entity150 to have a cameo , i want him to be the star , along with @entity152 and @entity153
" people should n't be afraid to " watch people age in a remake , " she said
there 's also the issue of actually getting people to movie theaters
familiar titles and warm - and - fuzzy memories can help sell tickets
@entity35 noted that there 's a corporate reasoning behind doing remakes well " and not just making people buy tickets because they 're suckers
" when " @entity172 " got green - lighted for a remake , some diehard fans of the 1987 @entity170 / @entity169 classic firmly objected
but their pain may have been alleviated by the fact that @entity175 , who choreographed the original , is directing the new version
the film industry is relying on so - called name brands in order to get an older demographic that might not be as willing to part with its money for movie tickets
it also serves as a nice was to clue in younger generations about the past
" it 's kind of fun to have a reason to introduce our pop culture past to kids today and make them more media - literate in terms of how their stuff has been influenced by the stuff we grew up with , " @entity35 said
@entity35 pointed out that " @entity12 , " " @entity144 " and " @entity203 " are more like " one - offs " designed to introduce a slicker version of the same old brand
the trend can be found in fashion as well
t - shirts with ' 80s fonts are big , as is neon -- lipstick , shoes , handbags , @entity213 's hair ; even fluorescent household appliances are flying off store shelves
another reason why the ' 80s is coming back is because the era was so hi - tech , comparatively
" movies went from low - budget auteur to big blockbusters , " said @entity35 , " and that coincides with where we 're at now , as depressing as that sounds
we 're almost like the @entity227 ' 80s
... we 're what @entity228 dreamed things would be like
it 's almost like we 're in an ' 80s do - over with new and improved fantasy technology
