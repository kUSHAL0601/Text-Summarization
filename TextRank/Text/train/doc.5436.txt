-- horrific events , such as the massacre in @entity3 , can be catalysts for social and political change
sometimes it seems that they 're the only catalyst ; recall how drastically our policies toward terrorism changed after 9/11 despite how moribund they were before
the problem is that fear can cloud our reasoning , causing us to overreact and to overly focus on the specifics
and the key is to steer our desire for change in that time of fear
our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis
we tend to exaggerate spectacular , strange and rare events , and downplay ordinary , familiar and common ones
we think rare risks are more common than they are
we fear them more than probability indicates we should
there is a lot of psychological research that tries to explain this , but one of the key findings is this : people tend to base risk analysis more on stories than on data
stories engage us at a much more visceral level , especially stories that are vivid , exciting or personally involving
when it 's not ' only a movie ' if a friend tells you about getting mugged in a foreign country , that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel traveling to that country than reading a page of abstract crime statistics will
novelty plus dread plus a good story equals overreaction
and who are the major storytellers these days ? television and the @entity55
so when news programs and sites endlessly repeat the story from @entity3 , with interviews with those in the theater , interviews with the families and commentary by anyone who has a point to make , we start to think this is something to fear , rather than a rare event that almost never happens and is n't worth worrying about
in other words , reading five stories about the same event feels somewhat like five separate events , and that skews our perceptions
we see the effects of this all the time
it 's strangers by whom we fear being murdered , kidnapped , raped and assaulted , when it 's far more likely that any perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend
we worry about airplane crashes and rampaging shooters instead of automobile crashes and domestic violence -- both of which are far more common and far , far more deadly
our greatest recent overreaction to a rare event was our response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11
i remember then - attorney general @entity94 giving a speech in @entity96 -- where i live -- in 2003 in which he claimed that the fact there were no new terrorist attacks since 9/11 was proof that his policies were working
i remember thinking : " there were no terrorist attacks in the two years preceding 9/11 , and you did n't have any policies
what does that prove ? " what it proves is that terrorist attacks are very rare , and perhaps our national response was n't worth the enormous expense , loss of liberty , attacks on our @entity116 and damage to our credibility on the world stage
still , overreacting was the natural thing for us to do
yes , it was security theater and not real security , but it made many of us feel safer
the rarity of events such as the @entity3 massacre does n't mean we should ignore any lessons it might teach us
because people overreact to rare events , they 're useful catalysts for social introspection and policy change
the key here is to focus not on the details of the particular event but on the broader issues common to all similar events
opinion : average @entity143 do n't need assault weapons installing metal detectors at movie theaters does n't make sense -- there 's no reason to think the next crazy gunman will choose a movie theater as his venue , and how effectively would a metal detector deter a lone gunman anyway ? -- but understanding the reasons why the @entity143 has so many gun deaths compared with other countries does
the particular motivations of alleged killer @entity159 are n't relevant -- the next gunman will have different motivations -- but the general state of mental health care in the @entity143 is
even with this , the most important lesson of the @entity3 massacre is how rare these events actually are
our brains are primed to believe that movie theaters are more dangerous than they used to be , but they 're not
the riskiest part of the evening is still the car ride to and from the movie theater , and even that 's very safe
but wear a seat belt all the same
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178
