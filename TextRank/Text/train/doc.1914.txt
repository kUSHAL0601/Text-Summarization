if you doubt there 's an unwritten code of honor among criminals -- governing certain behavior that 's just not permitted -- consider this : police say a burglar in southern @entity9 who stole an old @entity11 camera and tapes from a home discovered to his horror the graphic video content of a man sexually abusing boys
the burglar put three tapes in a brown envelope , hid them under a parked car , and then called police from a public phone , directing them to go find it
inside the envelope , police found a note with the home address of the suspected pedophile and a message from the burglar : " i 've had the misfortune that these tapes have fallen into my hands and i feel obligated to turn them in so that you can do your job and put that ( expletive ) in prison for life
" @entity9 national police confirmed thursday they arrested a 64 - year - old suspected child molester this week at his home -- the one that had been burglarized -- in the southern provincial capital of @entity48
the suspect is a local football ( soccer ) coach who lived alone
he lured some of his young players into watching pornographic videos together , and then sexually abused them , police said
police have identified four minor boys who were victims of the alleged abuse , including a 16 - year - old who may have been abused for six years
the suspected pedophile had reported the burglary at his home to police , listing various electrical appliances that were stolen
but he did n't mention the camera or the tapes , police said
at his home , police said they found other tapes with graphic content of sexual abuse of boys
and yes , they 're still looking for the burglar , the one " with a conscience , " said a police officer in @entity48 .
