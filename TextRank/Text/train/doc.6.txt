-- @entity2 lawmakers overwhelmingly passed new legislation early friday that allows abortions if the mother 's life is at risk
members of @entity9 in the devoutly @entity11 country spent hours before its passage debating the @entity14
the vote was 127 - 31 in favor of the bill
conservative and progressive lawmakers argued over amendments to the draft law
religious lawmakers and church leaders are upset over a provision allowing abortion if a pregnant woman is acutely at risk of committing suicide
they called it a " @entity34 " leading to easy abortion access and wanted it removed , but the provision was included in the final bill , according to @entity33
a woman ca n't just threaten to commit suicide and expect to receive an abortion , according to the bill
two psychiatrists and an obstetrician must certify that the risk of suicide is " real and substantial
" female lawmakers introduced an amendment to permit abortions if a woman becomes pregnant after incest or rape , but later shelved it when it ran into resistance , the @entity33 reported
in its final provisions , the bill underlines existing @entity2 laws to protect the fetus
" it shall be an offense to intentionally destroy unborn human life , " it reads
a woman who violates the law could face a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison
the bill has proved divisive even within the government
@entity66 affairs minister @entity65 , who was opposed to elements of the legislation , resigned thursday , prime minister @entity64 confirmed
doctors and hospital personnel involved in illegal abortions face the same punishment , according to the bill
woman 's death in @entity2 abortion case ruled ' medical misadventure ' the issue was brought to the forefront last year when a 31 - year - old woman died after doctors refused to perform a life - saving abortion
@entity82 went into a hospital in @entity84 , @entity2 , in october , complaining of severe back pain
doctors established @entity87 , who was 17 weeks pregnant , was having a miscarriage
but they did not terminate the pregnancy , afraid the law would not allow it
three days after the request for a termination was made , the fetus died and was removed
four days later , @entity94 died of a blood infection
public outrage over her death likely hastened the passage of the new legislation
it was proposed after a 2010 ruling by the @entity102 , but had been moving slowly through the legislative system
the @entity102 found that @entity2 's failure to regulate access to abortion had led to a violation of its human rights obligations
twenty years ago , the @entity110 ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother
but the ruling was never enacted into law , meaning there was little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion could not take place
@entity123 said the new legislation failed @entity2 's women by not going far enough to reform the country 's abortion laws
it did " the bare minimum " to comply with the @entity66 court ruling , and did not address other issues such as the rights of women who are pregnant as a result of rape , it said in a statement
" the new law does add clarity , but requiring women to seek multiple approvals from health professionals may delay or defeat access to legal abortions , " said @entity136 , women 's rights advocate for @entity123
" ultimately it does little to improve the draconian restrictions on abortions
