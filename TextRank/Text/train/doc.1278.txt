last year 's @entity1 show was n't bad but the greatest natural light display in a decade is coming this december , according to @entity4
solar activity will hit the peak of an 11 - year cycle at the end of the year -- and the more intense the solar flares , the more magnificent the aurora display
" the vast majority of auroras occur in a band known as the @entity18 , " says @entity11 , founder of a similarly named tour agency -- the @entity13 -- that specializes in @entity1 trips
" this band can expand when solar activity is high
" the best chance to see the @entity1 will be somewhere between 66 to 69 degrees north -- a sliver of the world that includes northern @entity23 and @entity24 and bits of @entity26 , northern @entity27 and northern @entity28
before venturing into any of these freezing wildernesses , it 's worth checking out the kp index , a measure of electromagnetic activity in the atmosphere
a reading of two or higher is considered good for @entity1 spotting
you can also head south , for the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , lighting up from around march 2014 onwards
here are some of the places the auroras will be showing up
@entity42 , @entity43 best spot : by the @entity45
" you can see the @entity13 everywhere in @entity43 , " says @entity46 , who 's spent the past year photographing the @entity1
" you just need to stay within the boundaries of the @entity49 , find a clear sky and check for electromagnetic activity on the kp index
" for him , the @entity55 , on the southeast coast of @entity43 about 250 kilometers from @entity53 , makes for a perfect shot
the iceberg - filled lagoon reflects the lights , making the experience all the more awesome
on a boat tour of the lagoon ( $ 31 per person ) you can concentrate on looking upwards and marveling
@entity46 recommends checking the weather forecast before setting off
rain or snow -- both common in @entity43 -- tend to dampen the experience
@entity69 , @entity23 , @entity70 best spot : in a hot spring
two major challenges when hunting the @entity1 are the cold and fatigue
watching them in a hot spring asolleviates both
the city of @entity69 , in @entity23 , is often cited as the best place to see the @entity1 in the @entity70
it 's home to the @entity80 at the @entity81 , @entity69 , which issues forecasts on @entity13 viewing conditions
if you fancy soaking while you watch , @entity80 researchers recommend @entity86 and @entity87
@entity88 is better equipped and better connected with @entity69 's airport
the resort also provides an aurora alarm service , alerting guests if the lights " switch on " in the middle of night
@entity86 , @entity95 , @entity69 ; +1 907 451 8104 ; rooms from $ 189 per night ; return bus tickets from the airport to the resort cost $ 150
the resort in the tiny village of @entity101 went bust but you can watch the lights for a small fee from spring - fed hot tubs provided by a local couple
