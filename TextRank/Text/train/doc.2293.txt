gov. @entity0 will meet with prime minister @entity2 when the @entity4 @entity3 heads to the @entity5 for a trade mission this week , a trip that will give @entity0 a chance to strengthen his foreign policy credentials as he prepares for a potential presidential run
@entity0 's three - day tour -- his third international trip since september -- starts sunday with a @entity14 game between @entity15 and @entity16
later in the trip he meets with @entity2 in @entity18 as well as with members of the prime minister 's @entity20 and @entity23 ambassador @entity22
" there is no other country that has such a strong connection to ours in terms of history , economy and culture , " @entity0 said on a call with reporters before the trip
" and , so , we want to continue to make the most of that relationship
" @entity0 traveled to @entity36 in september and to @entity37 in december , placing a heavy emphasis on energy policy while visiting the @entity23 ' neighbors
with the @entity5 as @entity4 's third - largest trade partner -- more than $ 7 billion annually -- the governor is leading a delegation of @entity4 business leaders to meet with representatives in the life sciences industry , including pharmaceutical and biotech companies
he also will visit @entity49 , a drug addiction treatment facility that 's backed by members of the royal family
@entity5 's prince @entity53 teamed up with @entity0 in 2013 to tour recovery efforts after @entity55 severely damaged the @entity56
along with sharpening his foreign policy chops , the trip gives @entity0 a chance to prove that he 's able to tone down his " @entity61 " persona
when he was in @entity36 last september , reporters noticed the governor was acting more guarded and restrained than his normal self
in an interview with the @entity67 , he acknowledged that he can be " flamboyant " at times
" but it does n't mean that 's the way i am all of the time , " he added
" you know , i have more than one club in the bag , and i 've demonstrated that over time , " he said
@entity76 gov. @entity75 , who 's also laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign , will travel to the @entity5 a week after @entity0 .
