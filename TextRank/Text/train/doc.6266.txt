-- two storied teams ... two superstar quarterbacks ... an iconic venue
sunday 's @entity4 between the @entity5 and the @entity6 at the @entity7 in @entity8 has all the ingredients to match the inevitable hype which accompanies @entity12 's love affair with the finale of the @entity15 season
streets will be deserted as well over 100 million watch on television in the @entity12 alone and it 's not just the action on the pitch which attracts the massive audience
the list of acts who have performed in the pre-game and halftime entertainment is a who 's who of rock and pop celebrity , including @entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 and @entity34
this year pop icon @entity35 will sing " @entity36 " just prior to kickoff while the halftime headline act is the hip - hop group @entity39
the @entity40 is @entity12 's @entity42 final indeed , one of the most talked about incidents at a @entity40 took place in the halftime show in 2004 when @entity51 's " wardrobe malfunction " raised eyebrows and became the most watched clip on the internet
this year 's performers , lacking the traditional cheerleaders as neither of the two teams has them , will be hoping to avoid the sort of mishap which befell @entity58 , while on the pitch the pressure will be even more immense
the @entity5 have claimed more @entity40 wins than an other franchise with six against one defeat , the @entity6 took the first two in 1967 and 1968 with a further triumph in 1996
the @entity5 have also won a record eight @entity67 ( @entity67 ) championships , including their 24 - 19 victory over the @entity69 to reach this season 's @entity40
the @entity6 claimed a record nine @entity15 championships before the @entity40 was instituted and their 21 - 14 victory over arch - rivals the @entity72 was their third @entity75 ( @entity75 ) championship
so with two teams with a lengthy history and impeccable pedigree a classic showdown is in prospect , particularly as the last meeting between them ended with a nail - biting 37 - 36 win for the @entity5
much of the pre-match hullabaloo centered around the team 's star quarterbacks , @entity88 for the @entity5 , @entity89 of the @entity6
they were given their own podiums to address the mass ranks on tuesday 's traditional media day while other players had to do with designated spots in the stands at the @entity98 stadium
quarterbacks hold the key but with that spotlight comes an awesome responsibility , a misplaced or intercepted pass can mean the difference between triumph or despair in the @entity40 with its history littered with tales of under performing quarterbacks
@entity88 has been there and done it , helping the @entity5 to @entity40 wins in the 2005 and 2008 seasons , his 35 - yard touchdown pass to @entity114 clinching their most recent triumph
and it was " @entity88 's " pass to receiver @entity117 in the final play of the game which gave the @entity5 that narrow one - point win over the @entity6 the last time they met just over a year ago
" we were fortunate enough to get a win but what happened in @entity125 in 2009 is going to have no bearing in this stadium
so many of the components of these teams are different , " said @entity129 coach @entity128
@entity89 finally took over the mantle at the @entity6 from the great @entity133 in 2008 and in his five - year professional career is the @entity15 all - time leader for the highest percentage of completed passes in the regular season with the lowest number of interceptions
it demonstrates a precision that may prove invaluable come sunday night as he seeks his first @entity40 ring
@entity6 ' fans will be hoping @entity89 gets the chance to dust off his unique touchdown celebration , dubbed " @entity147 "
after a touchdown or scoring play , @entity89 makes a motion as if putting an imaginary belt around his waist
@entity129 will be banking on their highly - rated defense to get to grips early with the @entity40 rookie and disrupt his rhythm
@entity159 's largest domed stadium so the stage set for a classic in a stadium which , it being in @entity164 , prides itself on being the biggest and the best
according to the official @entity98 website , it is the largest domed stadium in the world , has the world 's largest retractable glass doors at each end and possesses the world 's largest video screen
the world 's largest freestanding support holds it all up with the stadium able to seat 80,000 fans with a maximum capacity of 110,000
if a clutch of out - of - stadium tickets to watch on a big screen are counted , the record for a championship game , of 103,985 at the @entity184 @entity183 in @entity185 for the 1980 @entity15 championship game , could well be broken
with such huge interest and despite the economic downturn in the @entity12 , advertisers are still willing to stump up an eye - watering $ 3 million for a 30 - second slot on the transmission by @entity193 with the commercials " take " set to be another record
the only cloud on the horizon in the build - up to match day was the appalling weather in @entity8 , with sub-zero temperatures forcing both teams inside to practice and the @entity98 stadium shrouded in snow
the cold snap was forecast to continue through the weekend .
