turns out , the rich really are getting richer
and they 'll soon own more than the rest of us put together
so says a new report , which estimates that the richest 1 % will have as much wealth as the other 99 % combined by next year
" the richest 1 % have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44 % in 2009 to 48 % in 2014 , " @entity6 says in a report monday
at that rate , the wealthiest will own more than 50 % by next year , according to the report
" do we really want to live in a world where the 1 % own more than the rest of us combined ? " asked @entity14 , executive director of the international aid agency
@entity14 will co-chair the annual @entity19 in @entity20 this week
she plans to use the platform at @entity20 to call for urgent action on the rising inequality
the 80 richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion people , the report says
" the scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering ; and despite the issues shooting up the global agenda , the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast , " she said
" it is time our leaders took on the powerful vested interests that stand in the way of a fairer and more prosperous world
" while 1 % of the population owns 48 % of the world 's wealth , a majority of the remainder follows the same trend
" of the remaining 52 % of global wealth , 46 % is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world 's population , " the report says
the remainder of the population only possesses 5.5 % of global wealth
their wealth last year ? an average $ 3,851 per adult , the report says
meanwhile , the " global elite " members had an average wealth of $ 2.7 million each last year , it says
the report comes a day before president @entity62 is expected to unveil proposals that close tax breaks on the wealthy
@entity62 will discuss his plans to help the middle class during his @entity67 on tuesday .
