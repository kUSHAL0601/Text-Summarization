@entity0 , @entity1 -- a leader of the @entity1 discounted concerns about a nuclear - armed @entity5 in a @entity2 interview monday , saying @entity7 would find the ultimate weapon to be of little use
sheikh @entity10 , the @entity1 ' prime minister and vice president , told @entity2 's " @entity13 " that he did not believe @entity5 would build a bomb
" what can @entity5 do with a nuclear weapon ? " @entity10 , the ruler of @entity0 , asked
" for example , will they hit @entity18 ? how many @entity19 will die ? and you think if @entity5 hits @entity18 , their cities will be safe ? they will be gone the next day
" @entity7 has long insisted that its development of nuclear technology is strictly peaceful , aimed at producing civilian electricity
but it has refused international demands to halt its production of enriched uranium , bringing it under increasing sanctions in recent years
and the @entity31 nuclear watchdog agency reported in november that it has credible information that @entity5 has carried out work toward developing a nuclear bomb
the @entity1 lies just across the mouth of the @entity36 from @entity5 , with barely 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) separating the two nations
" @entity5 is our neighbor , " @entity10 said
" they are @entity41 , and we lived next to each other for thousands and thousands of years
i do n't believe that @entity5 will develop a nuclear weapon
" but other countries -- notably @entity18 -- are more concerned about the prospect
@entity18 prime minister @entity47 has called a nuclear @entity5 a " grave , direct threat
" @entity18 is widely believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , though it has never declared itself a nuclear power
@entity52 analysts say @entity5 could spur an arms race among other countries in the region if it develops nuclear weapons .
