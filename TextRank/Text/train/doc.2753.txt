-- @entity1 was lean and athletic ; he skied and walked a lot , and would go snowshoeing every wednesday with his friends
a golf course superintendent , he lived in @entity6 , @entity7 , with his wife and three sons
one evening in 2000 , he and his buddies decided to snowshoe up @entity11 and ride the gondola down
@entity1 complained of indigestion on the way up , which was odd because his last meal had been lunch
he told his friends he needed to sit down before getting on the gondola
after the group got in the cable car , he lost consciousness
@entity1 was not a smoker and only drank a glass of wine every now and then
his blood pressure was always fine
his physician had told him that his cholesterol was fine , too , but that he might need to watch it , his wife , @entity26 , remembers
but despite appearing healthy , @entity1 died of a heart attack at age 47
" we did not see that coming at all , " @entity26 said
" that was a tough one -- just when @entity35 was starting to become a good male role model for ( their sons )
" heart attacks may seem like a senior citizen phenomenon , considering that about 82 % of people who die of coronary heart disease are at least 65 , according to the @entity43
but sudden heart problems can occur much earlier in life , too
" @entity47 " actor @entity46 , 51 , died in @entity48 wednesday of an apparent heart attack
actor @entity50 died in september at age 54 , having never recovered from the heart attack he suffered on july 13
@entity53 , son of actor @entity54 , died of atherosclerosis , a condition that brought on a heart attack , according to the @entity59 coroner
heart attack risk goes up in men older than 45 and women older than 55 , but it can happen even earlier
while lifestyle modifications help reduce risk -- eating a healthy diet , maintaining good blood pressure and normal weight , not smoking -- sometimes it 's not enough
family history is a big risk factor that ca n't be changed
@entity1 's father had a triple bypass surgery more than a year before @entity1 's death , @entity26 said
and men are more likely to have heart attacks than women
what causes a heart attack ? a heart attack happens when the blood that flows to a section of heart muscle gets blocked
that section of heart muscle begins to die without a quick restoration of blood flow , according to the @entity86
heart attacks are often the result of coronary artery disease , which occurs when a waxy substance called plaque builds up in the coronary artery
an autopsy revealed that @entity1 had severe blockage , @entity26 said
the location in the artery involved plays a role , said @entity98 , a cardiologist in @entity99
if there 's a huge clot producing such extensive damage that the heart stops beating , it could only take a matter of minutes to be fatal
heart attacks in the @entity108 are uncommon among people younger than 55 , but the numbers could rise because obesity is a growing problem , said dr. @entity113 , @entity114 professor and dean of the faculties of health sciences and medicine at @entity119
being overweight leads to type ii diabetes and increases in blood pressure and bad cholesterol
heavy smoking is also a strong risk factor for heart attacks
refraining from smoking and not becoming obese are key for avoiding heart attacks , he said
if you are obese , make sure your cholesterol and blood pressure are under control
" there 's no better prevention than addressing the reversible risk factors , " @entity113 said
when a person who 's especially young dies of heart problems , such as in their thirties or younger , something other than blockage to the heart may be at work , @entity98 said
the heart could be enlarged or thickened , or there may be a congenital abnormality that would predispose the person to die suddenly
because younger people do n't believe they 're at risk of heart attacks , they might not get themselves to a hospital right away when experiencing warning signs
who will get a heart attack is still somewhat mysterious there 's still a long way to go in terms of determining who is most at risk of a heart attack , he said
" more often than not , the first symptom of heart disease could be heart attack , " @entity98 said
" that is a huge gap in the profession that we 're still dealing with
" red wine , minus the alcohol , may lower blood pressure a recent study showed that a test called a coronary calcium scan can be effective in predicting cardiovascular risk
this scan identifies specks of calcium in the arterial walls , which are an early sign of plaque buildup
it 's relatively cheap -- about $ 200 -- but does involve some radiation exposure
@entity98 recommends it for women as young as 50 , and for men 45 and older
but if you have a strong family history of premature heart disease , it may be best to start even earlier in the forties
one of @entity98 's patients , @entity190 , had his first heart attack at age 43
he drove himself to the hospital in 2008 when he started having pain in his chest , back , arm and jaw
he did n't know he had heart problems , but his grandparents and two uncles on his mother 's side had cardiovascular disease
the event was scary , but @entity190 did n't follow his doctor 's recommendations
his second heart attack was a month later
" the second time , he was noncompliant with diet and his regimen of smoking , " @entity98 said
" i was n't surprised
when he was very compliant , he does great
" in the past four years , @entity190 has had three stents and four balloon angioplasties
stents can improve blood flow and treat narrow or weak arteries
a balloon angioplasty is a ballooning of the vessel to open it
" i 've seen the results of me not taking care of myself , " @entity190 said
a more heart - healthy lifestyle these days , @entity190 is on a low - cholesterol , low - fat diet
he exercises six times a week , with at least 40 minutes of cardio and 20 to 30 minutes of weight lifting
practicing these behaviors " keeps you out of the hospital and keeps you out of trouble , " he said
@entity26 , whose husband died after snowshoeing in 2008 , watches out for trans fats and has warned her three sons about heart risks
they are in good shape , she said , and none of them smoke
" they know , with @entity35 having a heart event that early , " she said
" i hope i 've impressed them -- or just general health knowledge has impressed them -- with the importance of taking care of yourself
