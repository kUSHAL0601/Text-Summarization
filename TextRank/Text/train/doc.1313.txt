@entity2 an @entity1 court triggered an international uproar monday , confirming a death sentence for 183 defendants
the defendants were convicted of murdering 11 police and two civilians in august 2013 , @entity1 's state - run @entity8 news agency reported
those deaths came in an attack on a police station
it followed a massive , deadly crackdown by @entity1 forces on supporters of ousted president @entity19
" today 's death sentences are yet another example of the bias of the @entity1 criminal justice system , " said @entity20 of @entity21
" these verdicts and sentences must be quashed and all of those convicted should be given a trial that meets international standards of fairness and excludes the death penalty
" " issuing mass death sentences whenever the case involves the killing of police officers now appears to be near - routine policy , regardless of facts and with no attempt to establish individual responsibility , " @entity20 added
" so far , 415 people have been sentenced to death in four trials for the killing of police officers , while the case against former president @entity46 , involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the uprising , has been dropped
to date no security officers have been held to account for the killing of 1,000 protesters in august 2013 , " the organization said on its website
@entity21 opposes the death penalty altogether
thirty - four of the 183 defendants were tried in absentia
all are permitted to appeal
in july and august 2013 , hundreds of demonstrators -- perhaps more than a thousand -- were killed by @entity1 forces in what @entity61 said " probably amounts to crimes against humanity
" " the authorities have failed to hold even a single low - level police or army officer accountable for any of the killings , much less any official responsible for ordering them , and continue to brutally suppress dissent , " the group said
it issued a 188 - page report titled " all according to @entity74 : the @entity75 and @entity76 in @entity1
" since august 2013 , 343 police personnel have been killed , @entity1 's @entity77 says
at the heart of all this is the battle for control of @entity1 that has gripped the country for four years
in february 2011 , strongman @entity46 was toppled
@entity19 , a longtime fixture in the @entity85 , became @entity1 's first democratically elected president in 2012
but he was deposed a year later in a military coup after mass protests
also in 2013 , @entity1 authorities cracked down on former @entity19 supporters
in december of that year , @entity1 's interim government officially declared the @entity85 a terrorist organization
( @entity93 , the @entity94 militant group that controls @entity95 , is a branch of the @entity85
) @entity1 's current government , led by president @entity97 , has called for a " religious revolution " and asked @entity85 leaders to help in the fight against extremism
he has launched a war against terrorism focused particularly on the country 's @entity106 region where an extremist group recently pledged allegiance to @entity110
@entity3 's @entity111 reported from @entity112 , journalist @entity113 from @entity2 , and @entity3 's @entity114 from @entity115 .
