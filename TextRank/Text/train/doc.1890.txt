-- @entity2 's supreme leader took verbal jabs at the @entity4 saturday in his first public reaction since the @entity4 accused @entity2 of plotting to assassinate the @entity7 ambassador to @entity8
ayatollah @entity9 labeled the allegations " meaningless and absurd
" " they ( the @entity4 ) want to isolate @entity2 , " @entity9 said over chants of " down with @entity4 " in a speech before thousands in the western @entity2 city of @entity14
also , an @entity2 official said claims by the @entity4 that a high - level @entity4 diplomat had met wednesday with an @entity2 counterpart over the plot were untrue
" there were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries , and there was not such a contact , " said @entity21 , press secretary for the @entity2 mission to the @entity23
the @entity4 had reported having had " direct contact with @entity2 " about the alleged plot
@entity33 spokeswoman @entity32 disclosed the contact to reporters
a senior administration official told @entity0 it occurred wednesday and was initiated by the @entity4
two @entity33 officials said @entity4 ambassador to the @entity23 @entity39 met with @entity40 , @entity2 's permanent representative to the @entity23
ahead of saturday 's rebuttal of the claims of diplomatic contact , @entity2 officials had previously declined to confirm the meeting
@entity4 authorities have accused @entity2 of being involved in a plot to kill the @entity7 ambassador to the @entity4 , @entity48 , in spring 2012
the alleged scheme involved a connection to the @entity51 , a branch of the @entity52 , which formally answers to @entity9
@entity53 , a 56 - year - old naturalized @entity4 citizen , and @entity53 , an @entity2 - based member of @entity2 's @entity52 , are accused of conspiring to hire hit men from a @entity57 drug cartel to bomb a restaurant , where the ambassador would have been
authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a @entity57 drug cartel , according to officials and an @entity70 agent 's affidavit
@entity71 , a religious scholar and author , told @entity0 on saturday that the described plot " just does not fit the @entity51 's @entity73 ( modus operandi )
" using a drug cartel would be risky and a @entity51 agent would be more reliable than @entity53 , a used - car salesman in @entity78 , he said
it 's uncharacteristic , " said @entity71
" it really does not serve @entity2 's interest in any legitimate way
" @entity2 could more easily target @entity7 diplomats in the @entity85 , @entity86 and elsewhere , @entity71 said
" doing so on @entity4 soil is unmistakably an attack on the @entity4 , not on @entity7
" @entity0 's @entity89 and @entity90 contributed to this report
