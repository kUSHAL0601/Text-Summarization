a historic deal was struck early sunday between @entity1 and six world powers over @entity4 's nuclear program that slows the country 's nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions while a more formal agreement is worked out
the agreement -- described as an " initial , six - month " deal -- includes " substantial limitations that will help prevent @entity1 from creating a nuclear weapon , " @entity11 president @entity10 said in a nationally televised address
the deal , which capped days of marathon talks , addresses @entity1 's ability to enrich uranium , what to do about its existing enriched uranium stockpiles , the number and potential of its centrifuges and @entity4 's " ability to produce weapons - grade plutonium using the @entity29 reactor , " according to a statement released by the @entity31
@entity1 also agreed to provide " increased transparency and intrusive monitoring of its nuclear program , " it said
there was no immediate reaction from @entity39 prime minister @entity38 , who has consistently asked the @entity40 to be wary of any deals with @entity1
however , @entity39 intelligence minister @entity42 reiterated the @entity39 government stance when he said sunday morning that the last - second amendments put into the agreement are " far from satisfactory
" " this agreement is still bad and will make it more difficult than before to achieve an appropriate solution in the future , " he said
@entity10 warned that if @entity4 violates terms of the deal , " we will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure
" you can be sure that president @entity10 will speak to prime minister @entity38 " on sunday about the @entity1 agreement , a senior administration official said @entity10 will speak with @entity38 sometime sunday
" ultimately , we understand why @entity39 is particularly skeptical about @entity1 , " the official said , adding , " this is not simply about trusting the @entity1 government
there are strict verification measures
" @entity1 foreign minister @entity64 called the deal an opportunity " to avert an unnecessary crisis
" @entity64 said he hopes the nuclear agreement will lead to " concrete steps " to improve relations between @entity1 and @entity72 powers
as part of the deal , according to @entity64 , @entity1 retains the right to nuclear technology , including the enriching of uranium under the terms of the @entity80 -- which requires it not to create nuclear weapons or enable other countries to obtain them
@entity1 has agreed to what @entity11 secretary of state @entity85 described as " unprecedented international monitoring " of its nuclear program
" the first step , let me be clear , does not say that @entity1 has a right to enrich uranium , " @entity85 said , appearing to contradict claims earlier by @entity1 's deputy foreign minister @entity90
@entity90 -- on @entity94 feed commonly attributed to him by @entity1 media -- said that " our enrichment program was recognized
" in exchange for @entity1 's concessions , sanctions on its oil revenues will be eased
but @entity85 said the agreement does not roll back the " vast majority of the sanctions that are currently in place
" the deal was formally announced by @entity108 , the @entity109 's foreign policy chief , in @entity110 where the foreign ministers representing @entity1 , the @entity11 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 were meeting
but closed - door negotiations had been taking place for a while
a senior administration official told @entity122 that in the months leading up to the @entity110 talks , @entity11 and @entity1 officials held private , previously unknown discussions to generate ideas for the wider @entity128 negotiations
the official said talks began after @entity131 was elected @entity1 's president , and that as the discussions were occurring , @entity11 officials were briefing the @entity128 partners
the official suggested other partners were meeting with the @entity1 and briefing the @entity11 about the progress of those discussions
the @entity1 nuclear deal is a first step requiring actions by both sides , which have " a strong commitment to negotiate a final comprehensive solution , " @entity137 said
according to a statement released by the @entity31 , the deal halts @entity4 's nuclear program , including halting the development at the @entity29 reactor and requiring all of the uranium enriched to 20 % -- close to weapons - grade -- to be diluted so it can not be converted for military purposes
the @entity29 heavy water reactor under construction southwest of @entity4 had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations
for years , @entity1 and @entity72 powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement , frustration and at times open animosity
but the diplomatic tone changed with the transfer of power after @entity1 's election this year , which saw president @entity131 replace @entity165
caustic jabs at the @entity11 and bellicose threats toward @entity39 were a hallmark of @entity165 's foreign policy rhetoric
he lambasted the @entity40 over the economic sanctions crippling @entity1 's economy and at the same time , pushed the advancement of nuclear technology in @entity1
@entity131 has struck up a more conciliatory tone and made the lifting sanctions against his country a priority
despite the sanctions , @entity1 today has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones , according to @entity182 , a nuclear policy expert at the @entity184
most world powers believe that @entity1 could not realistically build a usable bomb in less than a year , @entity182 said .
