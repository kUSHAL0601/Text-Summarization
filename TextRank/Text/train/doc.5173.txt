@entity1 -- " terrorism and violence can not be permissible in @entity8 , " @entity0 told @entity2 's @entity3 in 2010 after declaring a fatwa on terrorism
the bold pronouncement thrust @entity0 into headlines worldwide and led to an invitation to speak at the prestigious @entity13 and @entity12
two years on , the religious cleric has resurfaced in @entity15 , demanding free and fair elections , after spending the last six years living in @entity17
@entity0 has come a long way since his time as a parliamentarian during general @entity22 's regime in the early 2000s
after promoting his agenda from abroad -- speaking out in videos and books -- he is now back in the political spotlight in his home country , calling for a caretaker administration to take the government 's place and carry out election reforms ahead of an upcoming vote
according to @entity0 , the composition of the caretaker government should be decided with the input of the judiciary and the military
but in a country with a history of military coups , @entity0 's mention of the army in the electoral process set off alarm bells with the current government and opposition who quickly reassured the @entity15 people that nothing would stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process
some @entity15 have suggested @entity53 is working on behalf of the military -- an allegation he denies
he maintains that he is working only to ensure a corruption - free electoral process
@entity0 threatened that unless his election reform demands were met by thursday , he would stage a " @entity61 " to the capital , paralyzing the city with thousands of supporters
" we will not succumb to these illegal demands , " senator @entity64 , @entity15 's interior minister told media thursday , in anticipation of the protest , which is expected to arrive in @entity1 on monday
@entity64 said he would not allow the rally to enter downtown @entity1 as it posed a security risk and would disrupt business operations in the city ; he said the @entity15 government had cordoned off sensitive areas of @entity1
" the residents of @entity1 are scared that mobs will raid their houses and there will be violence and murder , " @entity64 said
" i will hold @entity0 personally responsible if there is any violence or murders during this rally
" @entity64 announced last week that he had intercepted intelligence that the @entity15 @entity86 was planning to attack the gathering on monday
despite criticism from the government , @entity0 seems intent on marching to the capital , spending millions on prime time television advertising to urge others to join him
" we are expecting one to two million people who will join the march " , @entity93 , spokesman for @entity0 , told @entity2
" we plan on removing the barricades put up by the government and we will remain in the city whether it is [ for ] two days or 30 days , until our demands are met , " @entity93 said
however , just two days before the planned march on @entity1 , the only political party supporting @entity0 's march , the @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , a coalition partner in the current government , pulled its support
supporters maintain that @entity0 is only trying to make a positive change in a country that is in need of help
they point to his welfare organization , called @entity115 , which promotes " true @entity8 teachings
" according to its website , it has up to 280,000 members worldwide and works to build madrassahs around the country to teach young children the @entity121
the " @entity61 , " which is expected to reach @entity1 on monday , could be a game changer , analysts say , because it could have a major impact on the democratic process -- but whether the outcome of that would be positive or negative at this crucial time for @entity15 politics is still unclear .
