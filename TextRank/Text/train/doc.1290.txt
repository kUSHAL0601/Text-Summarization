@entity0 -- the @entity3 was " factually and legally " proper in 2009 when it fired @entity4 , who killed four people and wounded three others in a rampage this year , an internal department report said friday
@entity4 , 33 , apparently took his own life during a police shootout in february after he was cornered in a mountain cabin in @entity11 , @entity12 , about 100 miles east of @entity0
after a five - month review of @entity4 's firing , a team headed by a special assistant to the police chief found that the officer 's termination " was not only appropriate , it was the only course the department could have taken based on the facts and evidence , " the internal report said
the review team found the firing " sound and just , " the report said
@entity4 was removed from the police department in september 2008 and officially terminated in january 2009 for filing a false complaint against his training officer , who @entity4 alleged kicked a suspect
in an 11 - page manifesto this year , @entity4 said he was relieved of his duties after he reported excessive force by a fellow officer in 2007
" after a thorough review of all the available information , my analysis concludes that the discharge of @entity4 was justified , " @entity36 , @entity3 special assistant for constitutional policing , said in a statement
" his discharge was based on his own actions
the allegations he made against his training officer appeared to have been made in an effort to forward his own agenda
" police chief @entity50 said he sought @entity36 's review " because i wanted to ensure that the @entity3 is fair and transparent in all that we do
" all of us recognize that as a department we are not perfect , " @entity50 said in a statement
" nonetheless , this report shows that the discharge of @entity4 was factually and legally the right decision
" the report was submitted to the @entity58 , which will hear the matter at its meeting tuesday
a second department report will be published later this year on issues raised by @entity4 and others about alleged corruption in the department 's disciplinary process and about the state of employee relations
after unsuccessfully challenging his dismissal in court , police say , the renegade officer launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the @entity3 , targeting numerous officers involved in his case and their families
he had served in the @entity81
@entity4 killed the daughter of his police union representative , her @entity84 Â© , a police officer in suburban @entity86 and a sheriff 's deputy .
