-- ask @entity1 where he gets his ideas , and he 's likely to take you back to a house in @entity6 , @entity7 , torn by anger and disappointment
it 's not the popular image the singer often projects
at various points in his career , he 's been the savior of rock ' n ' roll , an @entity17 hero , a working - class poet and , perhaps above all , the icon of the @entity20 ( or , if you prefer , " @entity21 " ) , with fans hanging on to every utterance , every ticket stub
he 's a guitar god , a multimillionaire , a family man
but @entity1 has n't forgotten
" the deepest motivation comes out of the house that i grew up in and the circumstances that were set up there , which is mirrored around the @entity17 with the level of unemployment we have right now , " he told @entity30 reporters in an intimate discussion about his new album , " @entity33
" the conversation -- a rare chat for the often press - shy musician -- was filmed by director and @entity1 archivist @entity43 and turned into a short film , interwoven with music and video from " @entity33
" @entity1 's publicists approached @entity0 about premiering the film after discussions about interviewing @entity1 at the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52
this is its @entity17 premiere
@entity56 fans have certainly heard some of these stories
in concert -- marathons that can run three hours or more -- he frequently transitions between songs with monologues about his life
the ones he 's told about his father , @entity66 , are like closely examined scars
even at that , the heartfelt way he discusses his childhood in the film may surprise people : he sits on a bare stage with @entity78 tv personality @entity77 in a @entity80 theater , reporters arrayed in the orchestra seats , answering with measured , thoughtful observations
the relationship between father and son was fraught when @entity1 was a teenager
@entity86 , who died in 1998 , held jobs in a rug factory , as a cab driver and as a prison guard
none seemed to last long
at one point the @entity92 were forced to move in with @entity1 's grandparents ; at another , they rented
@entity86 was not a happy man at the time , and his son 's late - night activities , playing in clubs and bars along the @entity102 , did n't help matters
" some nights , [ @entity108 ] just sat in the kitchen of the @entity111 house , drinking beer , with all the lights off , " writes @entity104 in a new @entity1 biography , " @entity1 and the @entity106
" @entity1 has described his teenage self coming home late , hoping to tiptoe past the elder @entity1
often he did n't make it , and their conversation would descend into a furious argument , one that only ended when his mother intervened
" my father struggled to find work
i saw that was deeply painful [ and ] created a crisis of masculinity , " he said in the @entity80 talk
" and that results in a house that turns into quite a bit like a minefield
" @entity17 reality vs. the @entity17 dream almost 40 years after his first album , 1973 's " greetings from @entity135 , @entity7 , " @entity1 remains a source of fascination
" @entity138 " ( 1975 ) made him a star ; " born in the @entity17 " ( 1984 ) made him a phenomenon
in the last two decades his albums have ranged from the brooding ( " @entity143 " ) to the loose - limbed ( " the @entity144 " ) , with perhaps the best received -- 2002 's " @entity145 " -- meditating on 9/11
his latest album , the pointedly political " @entity33 , " debuted at no. 1 on @entity148 's album chart in early march , @entity1 's 10th chart - topper
he 's also the subject of two 2012 biographies : @entity104 's and a forthcoming volume by @entity153 ( who has written biographies of @entity155 and @entity156 )
review : " @entity33 " has strong moments though the new album has generally earned positive reviews , the politics that undergird it -- and @entity1 's determination to talk about those issues , such as joblessness , corporate greed and governmental responsibility -- have received their share of catcalls
" he should stick to music rather than interviews in which he offers social commentary , " wrote @entity169 in the the conservative journal @entity171 , dismissing @entity1 as " a $ 200 million poor boy from @entity7
" @entity169 has been an official in @entity179 presidential administrations going back to the @entity181 era
it 's not the first time @entity1 has come under fire
he has been considered out of touch , overrated and , especially in our contentious age , a reciter of " shallow left - wing talking points , " in @entity169 's description
the latter complaints have followed @entity1 at least since 1984 , when he bristled at being invoked by @entity181 in a campaign speech
for @entity1 , " @entity33 " is of a piece with his other work -- which , as he 's said more than once , describes " the distance between @entity17 reality and the @entity197
" " there is a feeling of patriotism underneath , " he said of " @entity33
" " at the same time it 's a very critical , questioning , often angry sort of patriotism
" a call to attention anger is the wellspring for plenty of great rock ' n ' roll : @entity213 's " @entity212 , " the @entity214 's " @entity211 , " the @entity215 ' " @entity216 " and pretty much every 17 - year - old 's decision to turn his amp up to 11
as @entity1 himself has said , " you can never go wrong pissed off in rock ' n ' roll
" but anger is usually overlooked in the popular image of @entity1
he 's often portrayed as a distinctly @entity17 bard , passionate and reassuring , celebrating the open road and eulogizing the past , especially if the present consists of boarded - up @entity227 and closed - down factories
but it 's there , in lyrics hissing like hot lead : " you 're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else 's past " ( " @entity238 " ) ; " i 'm 10 years burning down the road / nowhere to run ai n't got nowhere to go " ( the oft - misunderstood " born in the @entity17 " ) ; " the road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone " ( " @entity243 " )
as @entity1 told an audience at @entity50 in march , he has taken the message of the @entity247 ' " @entity246 " seriously , both literally and metaphorically
" that 's every song i 've ever written , " he said
" that 's all of them
" it 's no act , said @entity104
but it has become a means to an end : a way to inspire his listeners and call attention to social justice
" as he 's gotten older , he has come to believe more in the power of bringing people together with that music and sending them out into the world with ideas that need to be acted on , " @entity104 said
@entity108 and @entity1 became close in later years , but the early memories never left @entity1
" i think a lot of the anger that surfaced in my music from day one comes out of that particular [ time ] , " he told the @entity30 reporters
@entity1 added that some people may not want to hear the anger , or any reminders of real - life anguish
they 'll have their own interpretations
" you put it out there and people hear it , and then it 's up to them , " he said
but @entity1 will keep pushing forward and asking questions -- about himself , about culture , about @entity17 and the world
it 's probably why he is seen in so many different ways
" it 's funny , " said @entity104
" when you do readings about @entity1 , everybody comes up to you and tells you who they think @entity1 really is
and all of their opinions are different
" there 's nothing @entity1 can do about it except be himself -- anger , compassion , hope and all .
