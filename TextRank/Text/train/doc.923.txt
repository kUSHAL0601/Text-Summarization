the week before @entity1 hit @entity2 in 2005 , @entity0 came back to her native city on a trip for work
she stayed behind to help her family recover and has been home ever since
there was something she felt she had to do
" when something you are so familiar with is threatened to be lost forever , you cling to what 's familiar , " said @entity0 , who moved back from @entity10
for @entity0 and her brother , that meant bringing back a century - old @entity2 practice of masking , or masquerading , which was nearly vanishing
that year , she founded the @entity2 @entity18 and incorporated into the dance company a cultural legacy series of dance performance that would revive tradition of the @entity23 -- with a modern twist
" we wanted to do something representing this tradition and what it meant and symbolize it in some form
" the @entity33 practice started about 1912 , when groups of women in @entity2 ' red light district poked fun at society 's stereotypes of women by marching in street parades dressed as dolls
it grew into a tradition centered on dance and paired with jazz bands of the popular music of the era
groups of women embraced the attitude of freedom and the pageantry of the @entity33 street parades , but their focus grew over the decades
they organized and began serving their community through groups called " social aid and pleasure clubs
" " these were just people who were very much of their community , " said @entity60 , a historian with the @entity61
" they tried to help their neighbors during an era of segregation and limited opportunity for all people of color
" however , by the 1980s and 1990s , only a handful of groups were masking as @entity23
several neighborhood groups like the @entity73 and the @entity74 were active in the new millennium
but by 2005 , the @entity33 practice seemed as if it was about to be forgotten in @entity1 's wake
" my brother and i decided , we needed a sort of campaign , " @entity0 remembered
" it all started so we could give something back in our own backyard
" she had heard about the @entity33 tradition as a child and felt that it was a medium close to her heart
" it 's synonymous with dance and with women , " she said
@entity0 's revival produced the @entity93 , with costumes , face paint , music and dances that are modern takes on the @entity23 of the past
rather than using a live band , her brother @entity99 plays mixes of hip - hop and jazz for their choreographed performances
but @entity0 also wanted to bring back the community focus central to the @entity33 tradition
by partnering with local schools and cultural organizations , the @entity93 connect with youth through education and outreach programs
" mainly , our focus as been creating creative movement - based workshops and motivational assemblies , " she said
led by the fully costumed @entity93 ensemble , the group takes students from the history of jazz to modern hip - hop
the kindergarten - 12th grade workshops bring a cultural history lesson to inner city youth , many of whom do n't know the history of @entity2 ' treasured music and cultural practices
" we just treat it like we 're in @entity131 , " @entity0 joked
" we just take it from scratch with them , introducing the culture , the significance of all that 's positive about the @entity140 - @entity139 tradition
" sine their debut at the @entity142 in 2009 and the @entity143 during @entity144 2010 , the @entity93 have grown from a dance ensemble to an organization of women inspired to do good in their community
" it evolved from a promiscuous background to neighborhood groups mimicking that behavior , " @entity0 said , " to now , women of excellence
" with a group of @entity157 , the group is has more than 40 members this year
from health professionals to bus drivers to charity organizers , each of the women inducted into the group uses her time and talents to further the @entity93 ' mission
for @entity0 and others , the legacy of the revival was in safeguarding the history of the tradition
" the first responsibility that we really felt was the need to preserve it , " she said
" i could n't think past the museum
" @entity0 helped curate the first @entity33 exhibit at the @entity178 with a group of historians and authors
working with @entity33 elders and the descendants of @entity23 , the exhibit shares their stories and traditions with artifacts in the museum
as their membership grows , the @entity93 hope their mission to reach their community through the practice will grow as well
this year includes plans for health and wellness seminars to go along with their education outreach
" it 's related to what these women did in the ' 30s and ' 40s , " @entity60 said
" they dressed as @entity23 for @entity144 day , but they were still a cohesive group the rest of the year
