too strong for the @entity2
the @entity1 , defeated the @entity2 6 - 1 on wednesday to win their eighth @entity4 title and cap a wicked good worst - to - first season that delighted a city dealing with the aftermath of the deadly bombings at its signature marathon in april
@entity10 drove in four runs with a bases - loaded double in the third and an rbi single in the fourth as @entity1 took the @entity4 four games to two
@entity17 @entity16 , walked four times -- three times intentionally -- and scored two runs for the @entity1
a resurgent @entity21 pitched six strong innings before fading in the seventh and leaving with the bases loaded with a 6 - 1 lead
but reliever @entity26 got out @entity27 to blunt the @entity2 ' comeback attempt
in april at a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the bombing , it was @entity16 , known as @entity16 , who fired up the crowd
" this jersey , that we wear today , it does n't say ' @entity1
' it says ' @entity1 , ' " @entity16 said , standing on the infield as the crowd cheered officers who were on the field
" we want to thank you mayor ( tom ) menino , gov. ( @entity45 ) @entity44 , the whole police department , for the great job that they did this past week
this is our f * * * ing city
and nobody 's going to dictate our freedom
stay strong , " he said , echoing the newly minted " @entity54 " motto
the @entity1 became only the second team in major league history to finish last in their division in one season and win the @entity4 the next year
in 1991 , two worst - to - first teams met in the @entity4 with the @entity60 edging the @entity61 in seven games
it 's the club 's third @entity4 title in the last 10 seasons -- albeit the first that they 've celebrated on their home field since 1918 .
