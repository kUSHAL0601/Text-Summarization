-- @entity2 's hopes of @entity4 success were boosted on monday with the news that @entity6 and @entity7 have been passed fit for tuesday 's first leg of the @entity10 quarterfinal against @entity12 club @entity11
top scorer @entity6 was in doubt for the match , @entity2 's first in the last - eight stage since 2004 , due to a recurring hamstring problem suffered before the international break
the @entity19 captain missed saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity21 which ended @entity2 coach @entity23 's unbeaten home league record that started nine years ago when he was in charge at @entity25
however , he trained on monday along with @entity26 @entity7 and @entity27 , who were also named in the 19 - man squad following their recovery from thigh and rib problems respectively
marvelous @entity23 record falls -- but will it ever be beaten ? @entity34 midfielder @entity33 returns after a domestic suspension and striker @entity36 should make his second appearance after returning on saturday as a substitute following back surgery , but @entity41 striker @entity40 is ruled out along with midfielders @entity42 and @entity44
" this is a match that a lot of people want to play in but are unable to , " @entity23 told reporters on monday
" it has been several years since @entity2 have played in the quarterfinals of the @entity10
" the @entity10 is the most important club competition in the world
whoever plays it does n't have to look far for motivation
all we must do is focus on this match
" @entity11 have also been hit by injuries , but former @entity41 international @entity58 may make a surprise return from a knee problem to boost a defensive line - up lacking club captain @entity61 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65
@entity23 loses long unbeaten record @entity68 winger @entity67 is expected to return from a hamstring injury after training at the @entity70 on monday , and will give @entity11 an attacking threat that was missing in the last - 16 elimination of @entity73
" i was one of the first people to say that @entity67 would be an excellent player , and i said it when he still was n't a familiar face in @entity4 football , " @entity23 said
" i know he is a great player , but he is young and has a lot of room for improvement
i think he will be the best of the best
" @entity11 reached the @entity10 semifinals in 1962 , but this is the first time that the @entity85 side have qualified for the tournament since it was revamped as the @entity10 in 1992
coach @entity87 said his team have every chance of reaching the last four
" i do n't feel any pressure
no one expected us to be here at the start of the season and we have a big chance of winning , " he told reporters
" we are not just coming here to turn up
we want to keep progressing
" the dream is still there for us , we have to make that dream come true
we want to go all the way if we can
we know how difficult it 's going to be , but there is still a chance and we have to take it
" in tuesday 's other quarterfinal first - leg tie , @entity23 's former club @entity108 continue their title defense against @entity112 club @entity111 at the @entity113
@entity111 beat @entity108 on penalties in the 1997 @entity116 final at that venue , but go into the match with new coach @entity119 -- who failed to take the club past the group stage in 2005 - 06 in his first spell in charge
@entity108 coach @entity124 has yet to win a @entity10 match at home , and his side must bounce back from saturday 's demoralizing 3 - 0 defeat in the @entity73 derby which put a big dent in @entity108 's hopes of retaining the @entity133 crown
" the way we qualified has brought confidence , proving that we never give up , " the @entity26 said of his team 's elimination of @entity111 's fellow @entity112 @entity136 in the previous round
" that 's what we want to keep doing -- it does n't matter if we lost the derby on saturday
i respect the criticism i have had since then but the first - minute goal made life complicated
we 're obviously disappointed , but i 'm sure my players will react
and , yes , i 've never won a @entity10 game at home ( as a coach ) but i 'm not dwelling on it
" @entity111 's last game against @entity154 on friday was called off after an assistant referee was hit by a full beer cup thrown from the crowd , but by that stage defender @entity158 had already broken his nose and @entity160 and @entity161 also picked up injuries
former @entity73 striker @entity163 is ruled out along with @entity164 and @entity165
@entity108 striker @entity166 , a two - goal hero in last year 's final , returned from a two - month injury absence against @entity73 but the @entity169 may again start on the bench .
