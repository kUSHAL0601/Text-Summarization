you gave us a reason to reconsider our favorite day of the workweek
and , apparently , the @entity6 could n't get enough
@entity1 , the teen songstress who became a @entity8 sensation with the bubblegum ear worm " friday , " topped the @entity11 list of hot search terms in 2011
released in march , the largely reviled tune caused searches for the then - 13 - year - old 's name to increase more than 10,000 % over the past year , @entity11 reported wednesday
this year was the 11th for @entity11 , @entity11 's look at search trends for the year
the report , rendered with interactive images and detailed infographics , breaks down searches by country and region as well as tallying global activity
" from local celebrities in @entity30 to @entity31 looking for news on the revolutions in @entity34 and @entity35 half a world away , people turned to @entity11 to learn more about what was happening on the world stage , " @entity11 's @entity25 wrote on the company 's official blog
the top 10 was n't all breezy pop songs
" @entity42 " star @entity41 , who died in a car crash in june , was the third - hottest search , while @entity45 , the @entity46 co-founder who died in october , was ninth
@entity45 was already an internationally known name
but searches for him still rose 982 % over 2010 , @entity11 said , with traffic peaking the week after his death
it was a big year for technology overall , and @entity11 's results show it
the company 's own @entity55 social network was second on the list
( if that seems all too convenient , note that @entity60 rankings consider how fast a search term rises
so something that did n't exist last year , like @entity55 or @entity1 's career , is inevitably going to have an advantage
) massive video game release " @entity66 " was fifth on the list , and the @entity67 2 was 10th
squeezed between those two offerings , at no. 6 , was a tech world product that does n't even exist : the @entity70
@entity11 says searches for that term peaked the week of september 25 , days before @entity46 lovers learned that the new phone they were getting was , in fact , called the @entity76
@entity77 , @entity80 's damaged @entity79 power plant and acquitted murder suspect @entity82 rounded out the top 10
of course , where there are top risers , there are fastest fallers
as @entity55 emerged ( albeit to what appears to be waning interest ) , former social networking hot spot @entity89 slid , becoming the fastest - dropping search term
@entity95 , @entity96 web services company @entity94 ( a @entity11 rival during the company 's now - terminated efforts there ) and the spanish - language search " @entity102 " also saw big dips , compared with their 2010 search rankings .
