@entity2 says cigarettes kill more people than drugs that are illegal
@entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- cigarettes kill ; 400,000 people die prematurely every year from smoking
when we analyze the harm from drugs , there is no doubt that cigarettes are the worst
they kill more people than cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine and all other illegal drugs combined
more than 800,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana , the vast majority for possession , yet all the data from studies that compare the two substances show that cigarettes are more harmful to an individual 's health
if we make these other drugs illegal , should n't we outlaw the leading killer ? considering how we deal with less harmful drugs , making cigarettes illegal seems logical
over the past decade , we have seen , in states from @entity40 to @entity8 , increasing restrictions on when and where people can smoke -- and even momentum toward tobacco prohibition
smoking is banned in bars and restaurants and on some university campuses
people can now be fired from their jobs because they ca n't give up smoking
we have seen parents denied adoption rights if they smoke
in some cities , it is nearly impossible to smoke anywhere besides your own home
the @entity4 sponsored a @entity60 in 2006 , and we were shocked to find that 45 percent of those polled supported making cigarettes illegal within the next 10 years
among 18 - to 29 - year - olds , it 's more than 50 percent
but with all of the good intentions in the world , outlawing cigarettes would be just as disastrous as the prohibition on other drugs
after all , people would still smoke , just as they still use other drugs that are prohibited , from marijuana to cocaine
but now , in addition to the harm of smoking , we would find a whole range of " collateral consequences " that come along with prohibition
a huge number of people who smoke would continue to do so , but now they would be considered criminals
we would have parents promising their kids that they will stop smoking but still sneaking a smoke
we would have smokers hiding their habit and smoking in alleys and dark corners , afraid of being caught using the illegal substance
we would have cops using precious time and resources to hassle and arrest cigarette smokers
our prison overcrowding crisis would rise to an unprecedented level with " addicts " and casual cigarette smokers alike getting locked up
we would have a black market , with outlaws taking the place of delis and supermarkets and stepping in to meet the demand and provide the desired drug
instead of buying your cigarettes in a legally sanctioned place , you would have to hit the streets to pick up your fix
the cigarette trade would provide big revenue to " drug dealers , " just as illegal drugs do today
there would be shootouts in the streets and killings over the right to sell the prohibited tobacco plant
we have tried prohibiting cigarettes in some state prisons , like in @entity40 , and we have seen that smoking continues , with cigarettes traded illicitly
there is a violent black market that fills the void and leads to unnecessary deaths over access and the inflated profits
luckily , no one is proposing making cigarettes illegal
on the contrary , our public health campaign around cigarettes has been a model of success compared with our results with other prohibited drugs
by placing high taxes on cigarettes , restricting locations where one can smoke and banning certain kinds of advertising , we have seen a significant decline in the number of people who smoke
instead of giving teens " reefer madness " - style propaganda , we have treated young people with respect and given them honest education about the harm of cigarettes , and we have been rewarded with fewer young people smoking today than ever before
although we should celebrate our success and continue to encourage people to cut back or give up smoking , let 's not get carried away and think that prohibition would eliminate smoking
we need to realize that drugs , from cigarettes to marijuana to alcohol , will always be consumed , whether they are legal or illegal
although drugs have health consequences and dangers , making them illegal -- and keeping them illegal -- will only bring additional death and suffering
do n't just take my word for it
take it from the news anchor who was called the most trusted man in @entity178 , @entity177
here is what he said about prohibition and our war on drugs : " i covered the @entity185
i remember the lies that were told , the lives that were lost -- and the shock when , 20 years after the war ended , former defense secretary @entity189 admitted he knew it was a mistake all along
... " and i can not help but wonder how many more lives , and how much more money , will be wasted before another @entity189 admits what is plain for all to see : the war on drugs is a failure
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
