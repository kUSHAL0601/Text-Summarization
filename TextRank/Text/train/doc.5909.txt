@entity37 's arrival in the 66th minute -- the @entity39 striker also started on the bench after missing the match against @entity28 with a bout of gastroenteritis -- added another string to @entity1 's attacking bow but a goal did n't materialize
@entity26 , who will be hoping to retain @entity48 's @entity47 when the winner is announced on monday , passed and probed but could n't find a way through

@entity57 's side had their moments too with @entity59 narrowly missing out at the far post when @entity39 defender @entity61 flicked on @entity63 's corner kick in the 28th minute
@entity65 midfielder @entity64 , who provided much of the @entity2 's creative spark , also saw a chance go begging with 12 minutes to go -- his mistimed volley easily scooped up by @entity1 's keeper @entity69
both teams are now six points ahead of third place @entity72 , but @entity75 's side will reduce their arrears to three if they beat @entity77 on sunday
