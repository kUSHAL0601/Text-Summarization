@entity0 -- @entity2 is investigating a report that workers at a @entity6 plant that manufactures its @entity8 game systems have threatened mass suicide in a pay dispute , according to a statement by the company 's @entity13 office
" @entity2 takes working conditions in the factories that manufacture its products very seriously , and we are currently investigating this issue , " the statement said
@entity1 has not been able to confirm the full details of the dispute , but @entity23 , the plant owner , and @entity2 did respond to inquiries
the @entity6 contractor acknowledged in a statement thursday that 150 workers had protested at its @entity30 factory on january 4
the incident , the company said , stemmed from a decision to transfer all employees to an alternate production line
and though it was later resolved " successfully and peacefully , " 45 workers have since chosen to resign
" the welfare of our employees is our top priority and we are committed to ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and that their rights are fully protected , " the company statement said
@entity23 produces brand - name electronics for companies such as @entity2 and @entity47
a @entity2 spokeswoman later added that the controversy was derived from employee grievances in " staffing assignments and transfer policies , not working conditions
" overheard : @entity54 too dependent on foreign manufacturing @entity23 apparently offered disgruntled workers the option to transfer or resign , whereby they would receive " all salary and bonuses due , according to length of service , " said a @entity2 spokeswoman
" after the protest , the majority of workers chose to return to work
a smaller portion of those employees elected to resign , " the statement said
@entity23 raised workers ' pay twice at its factory in @entity74 in 2010 after a spate of suicides , @entity6 state media reported at the time
" we have a stringent @entity79 that spells out our expectations , and we monitor working conditions closely on an ongoing basis and address issues as they emerge , " @entity2 's statement added
" @entity2 is committed to the fair treatment and safety of workers employed by our vendors and to ensuring conformance with @entity2 policy
" after the 2010 suicides at @entity23 , the company said it was taking measures to improve workers ' lives , including organizing recreational activities , calling in @entity98 monks to offer spiritual consolation and setting up a 24 - hour help line
@entity23 , one of the world 's top electronics manufacturers , also makes products for companies such as @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108
it employed at estimated 800,000 employees in @entity6 in october 2010 .
