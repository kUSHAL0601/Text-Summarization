a @entity2 man pleaded guilty thursday to three charges over online threats he posted against the creators of the television show " @entity7 , " the @entity0 said
appearing before a @entity10 federal court , @entity8 admitted to charges of using the @entity12 to conspire to solicit murder , making threatening communications and using the @entity12 to place others in fear
he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of the charges when he is sentenced may 18 , the @entity0 said in a statement
@entity23 was the co-founder in 2007 of @entity8 , a radical group based in @entity2 that is supportive of @entity25 's philosophy
the former @entity27 resident , also known as @entity28 , was taken into @entity30 custody in @entity31 last may , according to the @entity0 statement
" @entity23 operated @entity8 to radicalize those who saw and heard his materials online and to incite them to engage in violence against those they believed to be enemies of @entity41 , " @entity30 attorney @entity33 said in the statement
" we may never know all of those who were inspired to engage in terrorism because of @entity8 , but the string of recent terrorism cases with ties to @entity23 's organization demonstrates the threat it posed to our national security
" @entity23 left the @entity30 in the summer of 2010 because he feared arrest after two associates from @entity53 were charged with terrorism offenses in june of that year , according to a senior @entity30 counter-terrorism official
investigations had revealed that @entity8 was the " top catalyst for radicalization for violence in the @entity30 " over the last several years , according to the official
@entity23 had a multitude of connections to individuals charged or convicted in @entity30 terrorism cases , the official said
they included @entity66 , now 21 , who last year admitted to posting online threats and attempting to provide material support to @entity69 , a designated foreign terrorist organization
he was sentenced to 25 years in prison
@entity66 , a @entity8 convert like @entity23 , communicated threats against the writers of " @entity7 " for an episode that depicted the @entity74 in a bear suit
@entity23 aided @entity66 in posting online messages that included the writers ' home addresses and urged online readers to " pay them a visit , " the @entity0 said
they also posted speeches by radical @entity84 cleric @entity83 giving a justification for killing those who insult the @entity74
in an affidavit accompanying the complaint against @entity23 , @entity88 special agent @entity87 said @entity23 worked with @entity66 on a " clarification statement " after the latter 's postings
the pair made website postings that were threats -- despite their claims otherwise , @entity87 said
@entity23 's links with extremists included @entity100 , the editor of @entity103 's english - language " @entity104 " magazine
@entity100 was killed last september along with @entity83 in a @entity30 drone strike
@entity100 knew @entity23 from his days living in @entity2 and invited him to contribute to a radical blog he was producing in @entity107 called " @entity108 , " before traveling to join @entity103 in @entity109 in october 2009 , according to the official
@entity100 told @entity23 of his plans to travel to @entity109 , according to the senior @entity30 official
the official was unaware of any communications between the two after @entity100 left the @entity30
@entity115 , a @entity30 citizen from @entity116 , @entity117 , who was charged with planning to use model aircraft filled with @entity122 plastic explosives in an attack against targets in @entity125 in september was in touch with @entity23 as he prepared his operation , according to the official
@entity115 asked @entity23 about the @entity41 justification of suicide bombings
@entity23 replied that what was key was the intention behind them and that they were an enormous benefit in a war of attrition , according to the official
@entity23 later invited @entity115 to speak in more detail in an online conference call he was holding on the website @entity140
in the e-mails , @entity115 did not reveal his specific plan , according to the official
@entity115 has pleaded not guilty to the plot
@entity146 , a @entity147 resident who in november was arrested and charged with plotting to detonate pipe bombs in @entity2 after allegedly beginning to build an explosive device was in touch with @entity23 via e-mail before he was arrested , according to the official
@entity146 wrote that he was big fan of the @entity8 website and " @entity151 , " another website run by @entity23 , and asked @entity23 about whether he could trust a particular individual , according to the official
@entity146 has pleaded not guilty to the plot
@entity23 's group was connected online to several others who have admitted or been charged in connection with terrorist offenses
@entity159 , an @entity30 woman who pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to assassinate a @entity161 cartoonist in 2009 , was a subscriber to @entity8 's website
@entity163 , a @entity164 convert to @entity41 who pleaded guilty to a plot to blow up a @entity168 military recruiting station in 2010 , also visited the website -- but was not in direct touch with its founders , according to the official
@entity173 , arrested in @entity174 in october 2010 and charged with making false statements in a matter involving international terrorism , attended @entity8 meetings and made his website a feeder for @entity8 's , according to the official
@entity173 , who authorities alleged attempted to travel to fight jihad overseas , pleaded not guilty
@entity23 's associates in @entity53 were @entity184 and @entity185 , who last year pleaded guilty to conspiring to murder individuals on behalf of a terrorist group in @entity188
@entity184 and @entity185 were arrested as they tried to board international flights at a @entity2 airport on june 5 , 2010
a few days later , @entity23 arranged for tickets to fly to @entity31
@entity23 also had a web of international connections , according to officials
he was in touch with @entity196 , the ringleader of a plot to blow up the @entity198 and other @entity200 targets in december 2010 , who pleaded guilty last week
when @entity23 moved to @entity31 , he asked @entity196 to take over the running of the @entity8 website , according to the official
@entity196 was part of a group of radical extremists linked to the @entity209 pro-al @entity206 @entity210 , whose former members have been implicated in several @entity209 terrorist plots
@entity23 's group @entity8 was a spinoff of the @entity30 wing of @entity210
the @entity209 group is still active in the @entity209 , operating under different names
according to the @entity30 official , @entity23 was also in touch with @entity220 , another member of the same @entity209 extremist circle
@entity220 pleaded guilty to soliciting murder after posting a death threat in november 2010 on the @entity8 website against @entity209 parliamentarians who had supported the @entity227 war
in a @entity229 interview in 2009 , @entity23 defended the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and argued that further attacks on @entity30 were justified
however , he said he did not encourage violence on @entity30 soil .
