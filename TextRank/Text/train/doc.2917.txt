in one of @entity8 's biggest organ trafficking cases
the ring , headed by @entity10 , allegedly helped scores of customers find organs by paying mostly young and poor men approximately 25,000 yuan each
their kidneys were then sold for about 200,000 yuan , according to the state - controlled @entity17
the @entity20 's @entity19 prosecuted @entity10 and 15 others involved in the scam , including some doctors from state - run hospitals
according to reports , an operation room from a township hospital in @entity27 was set up between march and june of 2010 , where more than 20 kidneys were removed from living " sellers " and sent to @entity2 for patients suffering from kidney disease
@entity10 then purportedly moved the operational base to @entity2 in the second half of the year to ensure easier transportation of the organs and to minimize their spoiling
police busted up the ring in december
one analyst believes the shortage of donated organs in @entity8 is the main motive for the growing practice , but added that the issue of ethics played its part
" the involvement of medical staff in such illegal acts reflects management loopholes in hospitals
strengthening professional ethics of doctors is important to wiping out the illegal dealings , " @entity55 , a professor at @entity57 's @entity56 , told the @entity17 .
