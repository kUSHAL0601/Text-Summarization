-- @entity2 president @entity3 and his wife , @entity4 , have filed for divorce in an attempt to clear the way for the first lady to run for the presidency , @entity2 judge @entity1 told @entity0
@entity10 jumped in the race for president on march 9 , but she has been dogged by critics who called her candidacy illegitimate because of a constitutional article that bars relatives of the president from seeking the high office
the couple filed for divorce on march 11 , the family court judge said
the divorce petition was a " mutual agreement , " so judicial hearings will not be necessary , @entity1 said
under @entity2 law , within eight days of the divorce petition being filed , both parties must meet with a conciliatory commission to examine if the marriage can be saved
if not , then the divorce can be finalized in another eight days
@entity1 declined to say whether @entity4 and @entity10 met with such a commission
in an interview with @entity0 en @entity33 the day before she filed for divorce , @entity10 declined to say whether divorce was an option to see her candidacy go forward
she did say , however , that she and her husband had an " excellent relationship , " and that she was very happy
@entity10 claimed that under @entity2 's civil code , marriage does not constitute a relation that is banned under the constitution , and she said that her candidacy was legitimate even without divorce
" i have the legitimate right to participate , the political right , the human right , to be a presidential candidate , " she said
critics are calling the divorce a fraud to circumvent the anti-nepotism article in the constitution , but @entity1 said that because the divorce is mutually agreed upon , no reason or cause need be given
" their intentions are a personal matter , " the judge said
if mutual , the only requirement to is have been married for longer than one year
@entity10 and @entity4 have been married for eight
@entity10 and @entity4 belong to the @entity62 , or @entity62 , party
in a statement , the party confirmed the pending divorce , stating that the goal was " to avoid further political manipulations from the opposition
" " they were in a situation that was difficult , but for the good of the nation , " said @entity71 , general secretary of the @entity63 , which is allied with @entity62
" they are doing it for national interests and not personal interests
they are making a sacrifice
" constitutional lawyer @entity80 told the @entity2 newspaper @entity81 that the politically motivated divorce made a farce out of the institution of marriage
" as public figures , they should set an example , and the worst part is that they are taking these actions only for the possibility of a candidacy , " he told the paper
" this means that if they win they can reunite , or if not , they can also reunite
