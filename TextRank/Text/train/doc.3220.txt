@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday narrowly defeated a proposal to sharply restrict the @entity6 's phone surveillance program that was exposed by @entity7
the @entity11 administration and @entity2 speaker @entity12 , unlikely allies in the sharp partisan climate in @entity0 , joined forces to reject the limit offered as an amendment to a defense spending bill , 217 - 205
a coalition of libertarian , liberal and conservative lawmakers pushed for curbs on the blanket collection of those records , arguing that it was too broad and intrusive
@entity7 , a former @entity6 contractor , revealed details of the bulk phone tracking effort and a companion e-mail collection initiative through leaks of classified information to media outlets last month
he has been charged with espionage
since then , a number of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been highly critical of the sweeping way in which the government applies telephone surveillance that is overseen by a secret court
they and privacy groups concluded the government had reached too far into the personal lives of @entity3 in the interests of national security
rep. @entity43 , a @entity45 @entity44 who sits on the @entity47 , said during debate on the amendment that the @entity6 had exceeded its mandate
he said the measure would have halted surveillance of people not under direct investigation by authorities
" the time has come to stop it , " he said
but rep. @entity58 said approval would have effectively killed the program , which he said has been found constitutional and approved by bipartisan majorities
" folks , we are at war , " said @entity58 , an @entity62 @entity44 and @entity64 veteran who urged his colleagues not to undermine the surveillance tool he said was critical for troops in the field in counterterrorism operations
unusual alliances the proposal forged alliances among bitter political rivals on @entity74
it even prompted an unusual tactical move by the @entity2 to weigh in on an amendment vote before debate , saying the proposal was hasty and blunt and would dismantle a counterterrorism tool
@entity2 @entity44 leaders tried several ways to stave off a vote , but agreed under pressure from many conservatives eager for public debate
a breakdown of the tally showed 134 @entity88 voting with 83 @entity89 to reject the measure offered by the @entity92 odd couple of sophomore @entity93 rep. @entity93 and 25 - term @entity89 rep @entity94
@entity12 , who as speaker rarely votes on the @entity2 floor , opposed it as did @entity99 @entity98
but 94 @entity88 and 111 @entity89 supported it
@entity93 told reporters his amendment was " about the @entity3 people versus the elites in @entity0
" he maintained that @entity6 program represented " a clear violation " of @entity108 protections regarding warrants
@entity93 said he was simply working to ensure the government was following the original intent of the @entity112 , the anti-terror law that authorized increased government surveillance powers after 9/11
@entity88 argued against the measure , with chairs of the @entity117 , @entity47 , and @entity119 committees circulating a letter saying it would have " unintended consequences for the intelligence and law enforcement communities
" national security pressure national security officials personally appealed to @entity2 members , hoping to derail the vote
they have said phone and e-mail surveillance have helped thwart terror plots
president @entity11 also has stressed that the @entity6 was not using the surveillance program to listen in on phone calls ; that it only collected metadata , including numbers , times of calls and dates
@entity138 , the nation 's top intelligence official , released a statement before the vote noting that he had joined others in opposing the measure
@entity146 @entity89 rep @entity144 , a critic of the original provisions on data collection in the @entity112 , said he was n't persuaded by the warnings from the administration
he voted for the amendment
" i never dreamed it would ever be used for dragnet surveillance of every @entity3 phone call , even if only for metadata
and frankly that 's way beyond what @entity157 intended , " he said
the @entity159 , a conservative think tank often cited by @entity88 , released an analysis that warned the amendment would " increase the risks of terrorist attacks by limiting the scope of court - ordered foreign intelligence collection and thereby depriving the @entity3 of valuable intelligence it currently collects
" but at a monthly forum sponsored by @entity159 that features some of the @entity2 's most conservative members , that argument did n't sway many members
eight of the nine lawmakers on the wednesday panel , which included @entity93 , said they planned to vote for it
rep @entity177 , a leader of the tea party movement on @entity74 , broke with fellow conservative lawmakers , saying the @entity6 program collects phone records from telecommunications companies not individuals , so there is " no expectation of privacy
" a member of the @entity189 , @entity177 warned that " if we take this program and remove from the @entity3 the distinct advantage we have versus any other country it would be those that would be seeking to achieve the goals of @entity197 who will benefit from by putting the @entity3 at risk
" the defense spending bill now moves to the @entity201 , but that chamber has not considered its version yet in committee or scheduled a floor vote
but in the @entity201 , there is little support for making major changes to the @entity6 program
before the vote @entity144 said even this amendment failed he and other opponents of the program would continue to press for changes
" it simply will not be renewed when it expires in 2015
it 's going to end - now or later
the only question is when and on what terms
