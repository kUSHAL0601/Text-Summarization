-- retired army gen. @entity1 won sunday 's runoff presidential election in @entity4 , seizing on voters ' concerns about growing insecurity in the @entity9 nation
@entity1 led with more than 53 % of the vote , @entity4 's election authority said
his opponent , businessman @entity12 , garnered 46 % of the vote
" i want to tell you that we are happy , that we are very excited by this decision , but at the same time we have a big responsibility not to fail the @entity4 in the next four years , " @entity1 told a crowd of cheering supporters
@entity1 said unity across party lines would be a key step in solving the country 's security problems
" let 's put these elections behind us ... and come together in the the things we have in common , to pull @entity4 out of this crisis that we are living , " he said
in @entity31 monday , @entity1 's supporters celebrated the news
" i am very happy because we are going to have a change in our country , " @entity33 said
@entity1 , a retired army general who pledged to take a tough stand on crime , was the front - runner heading into the election
he won the most votes in the first round of voting in september
low voter turnout was reported in sunday 's election , according to the state - run @entity47 news agency
concerns about violence in @entity4 , which has worsened as @entity52 drug cartels have stepped up operations in parts of the country , dominated the vote
in a @entity59 national survey in july , more than two - thirds of @entity4 said violence was what concerned them most , far outpacing the combined totals for the economy , unemployment , poverty and lack of education
" let 's hope that it 's not like it 's been with the government in the past , that they are n't just lies
the truth is that it 's important that we return our country to the right path
we need security , education , health
we really hope the new president does all this , " @entity31 resident @entity78 said monday
campaign posters for @entity1 , who led in polls before sunday 's election , featured a clenched fist
the 60 - year - old retired general pledged to bring a " mano dura " -- firm hand -- to @entity4 's highest office
in a debate co-hosted by @entity0 en @entity90 this year , @entity1 called for " elite units of the army " to play a larger role in the nation 's battle against gangs and drug cartels
but that proposed approach -- and @entity1 's high rank in the military during @entity4 's decades - long civil war -- worries human rights groups both in @entity4 and abroad
concerns stem from the fact that the @entity4 military committed multiple atrocities during the civil war , though @entity1 has never been directly implicated in any of them
the former general campaigned for president a second time this year
he was defeated in 2007 by incumbent president @entity111
first - time candidate @entity12 , 41 , who ran under the banner of the @entity113 , energized young voters
he promised to continue social and economic programs that he warned would be at risk , if @entity1 won
like the former general , @entity12 championed a crime - fighting plan
poverty is endemic in @entity4 , and the country has one of the worst crime rates in @entity123
forty - three percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished
and the murder rate last year was 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world
while supporters praised his tough stance on crime , others said they feared the president - elect 's platform did not adequately address poverty
" i think that he is going to make a government of the rich
i do not think that they are thinking about the poor and they are going to leave us forgotten again , " @entity31 resident @entity141 said
this is only the fourth time that @entity4 has held presidential elections since peace accords were signed in 1996 , officially ending a civil war that devastated the country for 36 years
the conflict left more than 100,000 people dead and a million refugees
@entity1 will take office in january .
