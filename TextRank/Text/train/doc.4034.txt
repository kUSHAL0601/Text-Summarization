@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the shadow of the @entity5 , an ironic occurrence is taking shape
as the former two - term president traverses the country , rallying support for @entity12 facing tough electoral prospects , his party is bracing for severe losses in his home state of @entity1
embattled two - term sen. @entity16 faces a bleak outlook in her bid for re-election , while @entity20
@entity21 and @entity22 are opting to retire , opening the door to @entity25 takeovers of their seats
a @entity25 and a @entity28 are in @entity1 ' two other congressional districts , and they 're considered safe for the incumbent parties
democrats here in @entity1 and elsewhere in the @entity32 are buffeted by constituent anger toward president @entity34 and his legislative initiatives like health care reform and the stimulus , regardless of how they voted on the issues
@entity1 supported @entity40 over @entity34 in the 2008 election by more than 20 percent
@entity42 is portraying herself as a @entity45 power broker who can easily maneuver between the two parties , touting her independence while also proud to be the @entity49 's deciding vote in support of health care reform
" without a doubt , they identify so clearly with the problem that exists in @entity54 , where you have democrats in one foxhole and @entity25 in another , and very few people like myself who are willing to come onto the battlefield and look for the common ground , " @entity42 told @entity2 at a campaign stop in @entity60
according to an analysis by @entity2 , there are 62 democrats in @entity32 states facing re-election this cycle , all @entity72 members except for @entity42
nearly half of those , 28 , are considered in jeopardy
these members consist mostly of white men whose districts went for @entity40 over @entity34
" i do n't think @entity12 are in danger , " @entity21 said
" i think this is a very robust election year in a battleground state in battleground congressional districts
and are we at risk of losing elections in battleground districts ? you always are in a robust election year
" @entity21 also takes a pragmatic view of the fierce competition in the old @entity91 , believing that a thriving democracy , while not a cure - all , is the best medicine
" this is one of those periods of @entity97 history that are very important
when the intensity and challenges facing our country are great , the intensity is on different sides
and that 's why democracy works
" @entity1 has bucked the trend among @entity32 states by electing democrats to all seven statewide offices and giving them control of both legislative chambers
and despite a public sentiment leaning toward @entity25 candidates , incumbent @entity114 gov. @entity113 appears to be coasting to victory
republicans in this state are anxious for change , though they admit it might take longer than the election on november 2
" we 're seeing the same trend down ballot
obviously , the governor 's race will be a challenge , but we 're seeing a flip all the way down the ticket
things will go from blue to red like this state has never seen before , " said @entity131 , spokeswoman for the @entity132
observers agree that @entity12 will probably retain control of both the @entity72 and @entity49 , but with much slimmer majorities
one reason for the slow change : tradition
" there is a tradition at the lower level , that my granddaddy was a @entity28 , my great - granddaddy , so i 'm going to be one too , " said @entity143 , editor of the @entity144
and the @entity12 selected by voters tend to be a mix of moderate and conservative on economic and social policy
" the local officials have not been @entity12 recognizable as democrats to a national @entity28 in @entity155
they are liberals by no means
" @entity143 is not prepared to predict a dramatic realignment in the electorate , but he believes @entity1 is finally catching up to the rest of the @entity32 by electing more republicans , regardless of the help provided by favorite son @entity162 , who has come to the state three times this year to campaign for @entity42
" @entity162 's great , and he is great in enthusing the base
but he 's not going to decide the election
it 's good that he 's out there , because he 's more popular than @entity34
but he ca n't turn the voter tide
" the question of whether @entity1 triples the number of @entity25 it sends to @entity54 wo n't be decided until @entity172 , but dr @entity173 of the @entity174 urges caution in reading too much into what a potential electoral switch means
" one election does not a pattern make , " @entity173 said
" but then of course , political scientists declare a pattern 10 years after everyone else has already declared
" @entity2 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .
