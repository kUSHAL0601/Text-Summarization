@entity1 , @entity0 -- violence and heavy metal seem to have been inextricably entwined since the dawn of the metal genre
accusations that the @entity9 killers were influenced by @entity11 's music were found to be false
@entity12 , @entity11 and @entity13 are just some of the household metal names to have come under public fire for supposedly inciting teenagers to commit murder and suicide
it 's a fire the international media has been happy to flame , quick to draw links between various acts of savagery and heavy metal even if , as in the case of the columbine shootings and @entity11 , evidence points to the contrary
for anthropologist , documentary filmmaker and self - confessed " metalhead " @entity32 , heavy metal is often used as a scapegoat to distract from the thoroughly more complicated societal problems surrounding such incidents
" i think people look at heavy metal and label it for all sorts of things because we need easy answers to complex questions , " @entity32 says
" i think that it 's easy to target a heavy metal band for inciting violence or making kids turn to a cult than it is to actually look at real problems in the real world
" it 's easy to see where the journalists , parents and religious groups get their ideas from
a quick scan of the lyrics of any heavy metal band worth its salt will often reveal some gasp - inducing subject matter
for instance in his film " @entity68 , " @entity32 quotes some of his favourite lyrics by a metal band called @entity71 : " @entity72 , bloody foam spews from your mouth , smell the putrid stench of flesh , as it burns you to your death
" not the sort of poetry to be quoting to grandmother over lunch , but can such ludicrous gore really incite people to violence , not to mention murder ? as one young @entity88 metal fan told the @entity91 's @entity90 newspaper : " it 's all fantasy , none of this is real , you ca n't take this seriously , it 's just like a movie
" but compared to some of the images filling our cinema screens -- the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 to name a few -- even @entity104 's lyrics seem a little tame
" i have listened to enough metal for me to essentially be a serial killer , " says @entity105 from @entity91 music magazine @entity106
" but there 's something in me that says no , that 's not what i believe life is about
serial killers existed before @entity114 , you know
" " i 'm a big fan of horror movies but @entity117 , @entity118 , those torture porn films , i found myself repulsed -- metal is pantomime comparatively
" as @entity122 quips : " there 's more blood in ' @entity125 ' than in my shows and that 's required school reading
" for metal musicians , death , blood and mayhem , in its various guises , are all simply part of the act , part of " the show
" " i think it comes from being a child of the ' 70s , " says @entity136 's lead singer @entity135
" i was brought up on hammer horror movies and things like " @entity141 , " classics like that
" " so while we do the devil type things , it 's done ... i would n't always say in a tongue - in - cheek way , but there is an element of it
it 's done with a view to storytelling and drama , with a bit of dressing - up going on
" @entity136 has also endured its fair share of controversy
the title of its 1982 album , " @entity162 , " and repeated use of " 666 " in the titular track 's chorus had @entity167 's religious right up in arms
they accused the band of being devil worshippers , satanists and of " trying to pervert our kids
" " when i play that song i think , well , ok , this is n't glorifying the devil , because that 's certainly not what i would do , " says @entity136 drummer @entity174 , a born - again @entity175
" it 's making an awareness that yes he 's out there , and you 've got to be aware
there is a man with 666 tattooed on his noggin somewhere
" ironically , the fundamentalist reaction to " @entity162 " packed out @entity136 tour gigs in every @entity167 town they visited
kids squeezed into arenas desperate to see what was scaring their parents so badly
despite this marketing draw , @entity135 is keen to distance @entity136 from the violence for violence 's sake approach practiced by some of his contemporaries , such as musicians from the extreme @entity204 and @entity205 sub-genres
" we 're not interested in being extreme , " he says
" we 're interested in being interesting and in animating people 's imaginations with the stories that we tell and the songs
" it 's an approach that chimes with what one female @entity136 fan , @entity217 , tells us , " i really do n't see any violence in the fans and i have been to loads of their gigs , " she says
" i am in a tiny minority of women , in a room full of men wearing black -- which should seem scary , but it totally is n't
the men hold doors open for me and apologize if they bash into me
they are basically really meek and polite
" so while upside - down crucifixes , homicidal zombies and lashings of blood might continue to fuel our preconceptions about heavy metal music , it 's worth remembering , appearances and reality can be very different beasts indeed .
