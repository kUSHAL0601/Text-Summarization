young mothers whose children became sick
these are among the reported abuses of 116 minors by agents from @entity12 , according to a complaint filed wednesday by the @entity14 and four immigrant - rights groups
the groups say in their complaint that the incidents have been occurring for years and called for an investigation and improved federal policies toward young undocumented immigrants
" given these longstanding problems , and in light of the rising number of unaccompanied children seeking relief from dangerous conditions in their home countries , the need for broad and lasting agency reforms is clear , " the complaint says
a spokesman for @entity12 said the agency has taken " extraordinary measures " to look after the children , some of whom are new parents
@entity38 wrote in an e-mail that children get regular meals and drinks , constant monitoring , and those who appear sick get medical care
" mistreatment or misconduct is not tolerated , " he added
the crisis of unaccompanied minors from countries such as @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 is growing
because the children are not from countries that border the @entity56 , federal law prohibits them from being immediately deported
instead , after three days they are turned over to the @entity57
but the @entity14 and the other organizations say children have too often reported incidents of abuse , freezing cold cells and rooms where dozens of people are jammed in with access to only one toilet
about 70 % said they were held past the 72 - hour detention period
four out of five described a lack of water and enough food , according to the complaint , addressed to the @entity73 's @entity74 and the department 's inspector general
@entity77 , the @entity78 , the @entity79 and @entity80 and the @entity81 also joined the complaint
the children were between the ages of 5 and 17 when the incidents allegedly occurred
@entity73 would n't comment on whether it was investigating the allegations
@entity87 , a leader of a chapter of the @entity89 , a labor union representing @entity56 @entity91 agents , estimated that more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles will cross the @entity94 border with the @entity56 in 2014 and that the numbers will rise from there
many of the youths turn themselves in to the @entity91
" they know that once they get to the station , we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the @entity56 , " @entity87 said
the numbers are overwhelming @entity56 facilities , particularly in @entity106
on wednesday , homeland security chief @entity107 told a @entity109 committee that he recently visited the border
he also told @entity111 that the @entity56 would open three new facilities to house the children and would pull scores of agents from their duties watching the border so they could watch the youths
