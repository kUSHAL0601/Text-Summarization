pot is n't at the top of the @entity3 's most - wanted list
they 're more interested in keeping explosives off airplanes
but if you pack your suitcases with 81 pounds of marijuana , @entity3 officers screening your checked baggage are very likely to notice
on friday , a 26 - year - old woman was arrested at @entity13 after the @entity3 allegedly discovered marijuana in her three checked bags , according to the @entity3
the @entity17 , resident was attempting to fly from @entity13 to @entity17 , @entity18 , via @entity19 and @entity20
" @entity3 screens every bag placed on an airplane , whether taken as carry - on or checked with an airline , " said @entity3 spokesman @entity21 , via e-mail
if officers find something that 's probably a crime , they refer it to local authorities , who can decide whether to arrest and prosecute travelers
" as is common practice , @entity3 notified the @entity32 of the discovery , who responded and took possession of the marijuana , " said @entity21
" the passenger was subsequently arrested on criminal charges
" a small bit of pot might not get you in trouble , according to some security officials
some 81 pounds of marijuana in three separate checked bags ? that 's going to cause some trouble
can i take my pot on a plane ?
