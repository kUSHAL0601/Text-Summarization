set in the seedy underbelly of early 1930s @entity6 , the movie " cabaret " largely takes place in the fictional kit @entity9 , a gaudy , raunchy cabaret full of drunks , dancers , glitz and -- apparently -- odors
the film 's director , @entity14 , preferred that his actors rehearse in costume , and while @entity18 ( as @entity19 ) had been fitted for her dress , @entity21 ( as master of ceremonies ) learned his tailcoat was not ready yet
so the costumer provided him with an old coat from backstage
" i want to tell you about this coat , " @entity21 told @entity0 before the january 31 screening of the film at the @entity29 in @entity30
" it was the coat of a thousand men
it had come from stock , and it had been worn by many , many actors for many , many years
" " and never washed , " @entity18 interjected
" that was way before anybody knew anything about , ya know , keepin ' it nice , " @entity21 said
in other words , the coat was a relic from the pre-antiperspirant era , and when @entity47 " got warm , all the lives of these other actors , dancers or whoever came back
" " i kept looking at him and going , ' what ? what ? ' " @entity18 recalled
the screening was a homecoming of sorts for the cast , because the film made its world premiere at the same theater on february 13 , 1972
although billed as the " 40th anniversary , " the festivities came just shy of the 41st anniversary because a vertical scratch ran along an entire reel of the film
computer technology could n't remedy it so more than 1 million frames were restored by hand
" cabaret " made its @entity73 last week
the film is only loosely based on the 1966 @entity78 musical of the same name
the @entity78 show was based on the 1951 nonmusical play " @entity82 " and @entity84 's 1945 book " @entity85 , " which included his earlier 1939 short novel " goodbye to @entity6
" many details -- including characters , story lines and songs -- were added , removed or interchanged for the film adaptation
for example , the @entity19 character was originally @entity94 , and @entity96 ' name in " @entity82 " and the novels was @entity84 ( the writer had used his own name as the fictional narrator )
also , there was no romance between @entity96 / @entity103 and @entity19 , and @entity96 was only bisexual in the movie
" i was the first one hired , " @entity18 said , " and i remember one of the first things our producer said was , ' tell me what you think of the story
' and i said ' really ? ' and he said ' yes
' and i said , ' i think that the man should be gay so that leaves that wonderful relationship and it just opens up all sorts of emotions that could n't have been there in the play
" in " goodbye to @entity6 , " @entity19 was supposed to be untalented , so there was some criticism upon the film 's release that @entity18 was too polished a dancer
in fact , director @entity14 worked tirelessly to make the @entity127 dancers look unpolished and unkempt
@entity128 , who portrayed one of the dancers , said @entity14 " wanted it to seem more real , shaggy
" he asked the dancers to pluck their eyebrows and then draw them in , not shave their legs and put on weight
" it was the first time in history that he allowed dancers to eat during rehearsal , " she laughed
@entity21 added , " when ' cabaret ' came out , it was so unlike the usual @entity143 musical
" @entity14 was not a fan of people " erupting into song , " @entity21 said , explaining the director 's realistic approach to movie musicals
" movie musicals were in ill - repute
they were n't doing well at the box office
as a matter of fact , @entity14 had had a big failure right before , ( 1969 's ' @entity157 , ' his screen debut ) so he was intent on making it more adult -- more relevant
" @entity14 's " cabaret " was replete with political satire and heavy issues such as abortion , death , nazis and the @entity166
all the musical numbers in which characters sang to each other were cut for the movie
" there was no change for me from stage to film , " said @entity21 , who had originated the emcee role onstage and won the 1966 @entity173 for best featured actor in a musical
" it was the same dark character , and i somehow felt empowered to make him even darker in the film
you could n't miss his intention in a close - up
whereas if you 're sitting in a balcony watching it on the stage , you 're saying , ' so , is this funny or not ? ' " there was no denying or question of what the intention was of this movie , " @entity21 said
" there are so many people who have said over the years : ' oh , ' cabaret ' is so much fun ! such a great movie ! i had the best time ! ' and i think to myself : did they get it ? ' " the film 's most controversial line was a lyric to the song " if you could see her
" as @entity47 slow - danced with quick dressed in a gorilla suit , the last line of the song went : " if you could see her through my eyes , she would n't look @entity216 at all
" the lyric and gorilla costume were meant to show how @entity219 was beginning to run rampant in @entity6 , but @entity21 said it caused problems in the @entity30 stage production
" there were a number of @entity216 groups who missed the point of that song , " he said
" they just thought that we were saying @entity216 were ugly
" the line was replaced with " she is n't a meeskite at all , " but the response was tepid
( @entity234 was an old @entity236 term to describe an unattractive woman
) @entity21 , who is @entity216 , said the lyrics did n't offend him and he was hesitant about changing them
" i conveniently forgot about the change a few times , " he said with a nod
@entity14 passed away in 1987
daughter @entity242 told @entity0 that when the famed director and choreographer worked , he " asked people to do something they had never done before
" actress @entity247 was still new to show business at the time she was cast as @entity249
" cabaret " was her second film , and she remembered @entity14 as a great director who brought out the best in her and found unique ways to challenge her
" he played tricks on me and used to whisper erotic things in my ear before scenes so that i would kind of blush and feel strange , " she said , " which i did
and , you know , all that to get a good performance , and so i learned a lot and it was really wonderful
" as the song goes , " life is a cabaret , old chum , " and that appears to have been the case for this cast as well
" we were so close , " @entity18 said
" we were in a world of our own , and i think that shows
" the actress / singer called the filming " one of the best beginning to end experiences i ever had
and every friday night , ( @entity14 ) gave a party on the set
in fact , there 's a scene in the movie where you see somebody playing the saw
that was a stagehand who played the saw
" she added , " making the movie was so much fun , and so weird and bizarre and very sensual
" " cabaret " won eight @entity295 , including best director ( @entity14 ) , best actress ( @entity18 ) and best supporting actor ( @entity47 )
it lost the best picture @entity295 to " @entity302
" " they said my name and my father ( director @entity306 ) screamed so loudly , " @entity18 said , " screamed in my ear -- that i still have tinnitus
