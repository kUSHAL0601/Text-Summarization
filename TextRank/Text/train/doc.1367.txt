@entity0 , @entity1 -- the military judge overseeing the trial of admitted @entity0 gunman maj. @entity5 told defense attorneys thursday that they ca n't drop out of the case -- even though they believe it 's tantamount to helping him commit suicide
" this is nothing more than their disagreement with @entity5 's strategy in conducting his defense , " said the judge , col. @entity11 , rejecting a motion by the standby counsel who are tasked with assisting @entity5 as he represents himself
the attorneys argued wednesday that @entity5 is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence
@entity11 's decision sparked a bitter fight in a trial focused on charges that @entity5 shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 in the november 2009 rampage at the army installation near @entity30 , @entity1
" we believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics
it 's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel , " said lt. col. @entity35 , head of @entity5 's legal team
he asked for a stay on her order , which would prevent it from going into effect
the judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with @entity5 would be an ethical violation
" i will make it easy for you
i 've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability , " @entity11 said
@entity35 would have nothing of it , his voice raised in obvious frustration
" the order does not relieve us of the responsibility
... we believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant
this is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today : assist this man in achieving the goal , which we believe is achieving a death sentence
" the lead prosecutor chimed in , questioning the defense team 's claims , saying that @entity5 is mounting a legitimate defense
" the government sees only two defenses : either ' i did n't do it , ' or ' i did it , with an excuse
' he was caught with a gun in his hand , " said col. @entity77
" i do n't understand how that 's repugnant to defense counsel -- i 'm truly perplexed
" in a military capital trial , a guilty plea is not an option
@entity5 's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges
but on tuesday , @entity5 used his opening statement to declare " i am the shooter
" after the standby counsel argued wednesday that @entity5 was seeking the death penalty , @entity5 objected , calling it " a twist of the facts
" but he refused to submit his objection in writing , a move that @entity11 requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court
the defense attorneys thursday immediately appealed @entity11 's ruling
but she gave no stay in the meantime
" we 're going to move forward , " the judge said , allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in
the trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of @entity5 's shooting spree
the attorneys ' request wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony
although @entity5 , a @entity116 - born citizen of @entity118 descent , was granted his request to represent himself , @entity11 ruled before the court - martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings
expert : judge ca n't let attorneys stop @entity127 , a military justice expert at the @entity128 in @entity129 , said the defense lawyers are in " a terrible predicament
" " they have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck , and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers , " he said
but @entity127 said @entity5 not only has the right to defend himself , " he has the right to do it poorly " -- even to the point of asking for death
" the defense lawyers would love to get off this case , because it becomes unbearable , " @entity127 said
" if you imagine having to sit there , being an ardent opponent of capital punishment , watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes , it must be torture
but the judge ca n't let them off the case
" military death row : more than 50 years and no executions witnesses describe horror of shooting @entity5 , an @entity167 psychiatrist , was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage
he listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that november day at a processing center for soldiers heading to @entity175 and @entity176
staff sgt. @entity177 stared hard at @entity5 , appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times
but @entity5 just stared back
the courtroom turned silent as @entity177 was called as a witness
he was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against @entity5
@entity177 recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center , shouted " @entity188 , " pulled out a pistol and began shooting
" it was a state of panic , " @entity177 said
@entity177 , a health care specialist , described how his friend and colleague , physician 's assistant @entity195 , tried to hit @entity5 with a chair to stop the shooting ; @entity5 shot him dead
soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as @entity5 fired dozens of shots
as @entity177 was checking behind him , " @entity5 is turning the weapon on me , " he said
" he has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and i blink
in that time , he discharges his weapon
the first round , i 'm hit in the head
" a second shot caught @entity177 in the back
he decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door
he made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside , he testified
@entity5 continued shooting at @entity218 even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center , before police arrived
officers shot and wounded @entity5 , ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down
after the prosecution finished questioning @entity177 , the judge asked @entity5 whether he had any questions for the witness
" i have no questions , " @entity5 said
@entity5 also declined to question @entity230 , who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began
prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call , where she pleaded for help
scheduled to go to @entity175 @entity5 had been scheduled to deploy to @entity175 before the killings
prosecutors hope to show that the devout @entity240 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime
@entity5 did not want to deploy to fight against other @entity240 and believed " that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " said col. @entity77 , the lead prosecutor in the case
investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began , @entity77 said
@entity5 carried two laser - sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition , his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together , he said
internet searches on @entity5 's computer used keywords like " terrorist killing , " " innocent , " " @entity269 , " " fatwas " and " suicide bombings , " @entity77 said
@entity5 told the panel in his opening statement , " we mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion
" but , he added , " i apologize for the mistakes i made in this endeavor
" the mujahedeen consider themselves warriors who defend the @entity283 faith
witness : ' his punishment will come ' @entity5 told his family he had been taunted after the @entity288 attacks of september 11 , 2001
investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity292 , the @entity293 - @entity116 radical cleric killed by a @entity116 drone attack in 2011
the case was first set to begin in march 2012 , but was delayed repeatedly , notably over a previous judge 's unsuccessful demand that the beard @entity5 has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved
@entity2 's @entity301 and @entity302 contributed to this report .
