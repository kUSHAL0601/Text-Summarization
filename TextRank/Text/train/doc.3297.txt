-- what kind of people spend thousands of dollars transforming their front yard into a landscape of tombstones and singing skeletons , complete with a haunted maze and " @entity8 , " in the name of @entity10 ? a retired kindergarten teacher and his cooperative wife , of course
at this time of year , however , @entity14 and @entity15 are known to neighbors as " @entity14 " and " @entity17
" now in its eighth year , @entity18 is a local attraction in @entity20 , @entity21 , making it one of many homegrown spooky houses to pop up across the country this @entity10 season
with professional haunts costing more than $ 20 per person in some places , proprietors of homemade affairs say they are hosting more and more visitors each year
" @entity14 " and " @entity17 " do n't ask for money to enter @entity32 , but they accept donations , which they give in full to the @entity35
two years ago , they raised more than $ 5,000 , @entity36 said
" my wife and i love @entity10
also , since i enjoy children so much and they have been such a large part of my life as a teacher , it makes @entity10 even more enjoyable to do something for them , " he said
" we call it ' family frightful
' we do n't do gore or blood
it 's a chance for families to spend old - fashioned , quality time together
what 's better than that ? " it 's not unusual for families to spend hours exploring @entity18 , because there 's so much to see , he said
there 's an hourly light show and a graveyard of 100 tombstones , ghouls and monsters named for their grandson , @entity65 a homemade hearse contains a " @entity8 " of animatronic singing skulls
a crowd favorite , @entity69 , communicates to visitors from his cage with the help of a remote microphone and an infrared camera monitored by one of @entity77 's buddies from his living room
do - it - yourself @entity10 decorating 101 a maze in the four - car garage leads you to a caged " insane asylum " of fright flick favorites including @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87
@entity0 ireporter @entity88 visited @entity32 last saturday with her 4 - year - old son and spent nearly two hours exploring
her son 's favorite attraction was the garage maze , which has an electric chair that rattles and groans and lets off smoke when you sit on it , she said
" he had a good time
he did n't want to leave , " she said
" real live ghouls roam around the stand behind bushes and ' boo ' you
" it 's a large undertaking to set the scene for thousands of visitors each year
dozens of friends pitch in and they get a little help from students who volunteer for high school credit , which is why they do it every other year , @entity15 said
" it 's really a lot of fun but we do it every two years because it 's much work
it takes us three months to get ready , " he said
@entity119 and @entity120 of @entity121 , @entity122 , also take several months to prepare their house of @entity125 , a graveyard of zombies and monsters that has grow in size over the past eight years
each year brings more visitors , @entity130 said
about 300 visitors came by last weekend , not including the retirement home bus and hayride that passed by
the house on @entity136 has also become a local legend
ireporter @entity138 made a point of visiting saturday after missing it last year
as he pulled his car up to the house , he was greeted by a chainsaw - wielding @entity87 from the movie " @entity10
" " others down the street are starting to dress up their house because of the response , " @entity138 said
" he obviously takes a lot of time on the creatures
" the couple do n't charge visitors a fee to view the collection of 17 zombies and monsters , each of which @entity130 makes by hand
this year 's new addition : the infamous scene from " @entity163 " of the possessed young girl strapped to a bed
it was simple , really , he said
a nurse friend gave him a gown and scrubs for clothes , and he made the body out of packing foam and the bed from wood left over at work
" the thing that cost the most was the mask of her face , which i found online
but i did n't like how it looked so i painted over it to make it look better , " he said
it 's a true labor of love that goes back to childhood , when he 'd construct his own tombstone decorations of cardboard for his mother 's home
" i love @entity10 , it 's just like @entity192 , " he said
" as much as i like @entity10 and horror movies , i 'll keep doing it until i ca n't anymore
i have more space in the backyard so i 'll probably end up there next year
