-- marathon man @entity1 survived another epic on his return to competitive tennis after his record - breaking 11 - hour @entity6 match
the @entity7 saved two match points before beating @entity9 , from @entity10 , 4 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 6 to seal his place in the quarterfinals of the @entity13
it is @entity1 's first tournament since @entity6 back in june when his opening round victory over @entity18 @entity17 in @entity19 clocked in as the longest match in tennis history
@entity1 's battle with @entity17 stretched over three days and 183 games before he finally triumphed , 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 7 7 - 6 70 - 68
he later told @entity0 : " i really did n't think it was going to end
" @entity1 reflects on ' crazy ' @entity6 match the match turned @entity1 into a household name in the sport , and after his straight sets defeat to @entity30 in the second round the 25 - year - old targeted a prolonged period of rest
but on his return to the court he was made to work hard by @entity9 , saving two match points and firing 33 aces as he won in two - and - a - half hours to delight the 5,000 strong crowd
" i did n't want to let [ the fans ] down , " @entity1 told the @entity39 tour website
" i did n't want to lose my first match here
also , i had a lot of friends and family here , so i did n't want to go out early
" i had n't seen a live ball in quite some time and @entity9 was never going to give me rhythm with his lefty serve
i felt i was shedding the rust off in the second and third sets
i will only keep getting better
" as a tennis player you need a lot of matches to play your best
this was one of the biggest wins of the year
i wanted to get matches under my belt before @entity61 and the two masters 1000s
" @entity1 was catapulted to a new level of fame after his marathon match but the world number 19 insists he wants to be remembered for more than just a first - round @entity6 victory
" i 'm ranked in the top 20 , i think i can still improve and keep climbing , " he said
" my goal is to reach the top 10 and contend at the really big events
" the match was pretty ugly to be honest , but i was proud how i competed and the crowd helped in that regard
" i was down break points a couple of times in the second set -- they were kind of baby match points with the way he was serving
" @entity1 will now face fellow @entity7 @entity82 in the last eight .
