-- the movement to stop a horrific new @entity3 - like penal code in @entity4 is growing
on tuesday , i spoke at a rally organized by the @entity7 to demand that the sultan of @entity4 immediately rescind the new law that includes the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians and the public flogging of women
these " kill - a - gay " laws or laws that allow the brutal whipping of women for abortions violate international law and have no place in civilized society
my husband , @entity25 , said it clearly at the rally : " what year is it , 1814 or 2014 ? " as a board member of the @entity7 , i fought to stop the @entity3 in @entity30
when no one else was paying attention , we were there , exposing the @entity3 's reign of terror and the special viciousness it reserved for women and girls
we built a strong , diverse , unrelenting movement against the @entity3 and helped @entity30 women rally against gender apartheid
we fought the @entity3 then , and we will fight these @entity3 - like laws now
there is no room for compromise
we are talking about people being stoned to death
we are talking about people being flogged
as we saw all too recently in @entity30 , flogging can lead to death or paralysis
this is cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment for actions that no one should dare call " crimes
" no one should be killed for who they are or whom they love
women should not be abused for making their own health decisions
the @entity62 has expressed deep concern about this new penal code and has stated unequivocally that the @entity4 law violates international law and human rights
now that the sultan of @entity4 has announced that the law will begin to be phased in , the @entity68 and the @entity69 must condemn the @entity4 government
and if @entity4 fails to rescind this gruesome law , the @entity69 should investigate whether @entity4 should be allowed to remain a member of that body , a privilege it has had since 1984
i pledge to do my part
the @entity7 pulled its annual @entity79 , an event that @entity82 co-chair every year , from the @entity83 -- a @entity85 property owned by the @entity86
the agency is managed by the @entity4 @entity88 , which is controlled by the sultan
we simply could not hold women 's rights event at a hotel whose owner blatantly violates basic human rights
we have also joined with lgbt rights groups and other women 's right groups to protest this draconian new penal code
although the law is being styled as a " religious " law , we see here , as we saw in @entity30 , that religion has little to do with it
this is about a dictatorship using terror tactics to control the population
and we ca n't stand for that
the sultan announced last week that he would phase in the new penal code over three years -- and the first phase , which includes fines and prison sentences , went into effect may 1
the second phase includes corporal punishment such as amputations and flogging women who have abortions
the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians is slated for the third phase
but we can stop it
we 've done it before , and you can help
the @entity7 has launched a massive petition drive and social media campaign using the hashtag # @entity133 , calling on the government of @entity4 to rescind the code and asking the @entity69 to take action
sign the petition , and then spread the word
we want everyone to know about this outrageous penal code
for human rights and dignity , it must be changed
join us on @entity145 / @entity144 .
