@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge in @entity0 sentenced a 31 - year - old man to death friday for his role in a deadly home invasion that killed a woman and her two daughters in 2007
jurors convicted @entity11 in october on six capital felony charges
the 12 - member jury had recommended death by lethal injection on each of the counts
" the task of sentencing another human being to death is the most sober and somber experience a judge can have , " said @entity20 judge @entity19
@entity26 responded friday , saying that he " came into this trial angry and defiant
" it 's a " surreal experience to be condemned to die , " he said
" our apathetic pursuits trampled the innocent
" he said , " i did not rape
i did not pour that gas or light that fire
" " i will never find peace again and my soul is torn , " @entity26 added
the family of his victims left the courtroom before @entity26 spoke
@entity41 , in a victim 's statement prior to the sentencing , said the killings of his daughter and granddaughters had left him " half - past dead
" " they offered to give you everything you asked for , you did n't have to take their lives , " he told @entity26
" you will from now on be known as a prison number in the book of death
you are now in @entity54 's hands
" the man convicted of being @entity26 's accomplice , @entity11 , was sentenced to death in 2010
juries convicted the pair on charges that they beat and tied up dr. @entity11 , raped and strangled his wife , molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before trying to flee
@entity11 is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters
" i lost my family and my home , " said @entity11
" my wife , my friend , my partner
i miss our late night chats and our partnership in raising the girls
" before assaulting and killing @entity11 , @entity11 forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $ 15,000 from an account after finding evidence that the account held between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 , authorities said
the two daughters , who were both tied to their beds , died of smoke inhalation , while @entity11 managed to escape from the basement , where he had been held
@entity11 had been charged with third - degree burglary in 2003 and sentenced to five years in prison
he was released three years later to a halfway house , where he met @entity26
@entity26 's attorneys had asked for leniency , arguing that he had no prior history of violence , was abused as a child and had been committed to a mental hospital for depression .
