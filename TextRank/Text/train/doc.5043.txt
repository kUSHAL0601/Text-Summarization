-- march 29 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 : disaster - affected areas @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity14 , @entity15 : an airport 's recovery , a former president 's return to @entity6 , and a plan to block out the sun ! all of it 's on the schedule for today 's show
this is @entity0 ! first up : sign of @entity29 @entity30 : we 're starting today in @entity4 at the damaged @entity33 nuclear power plant
engineers are trying to figure out just how much the recent earthquake and tsunami damaged the plant 's nuclear reactors , and what that might mean for the area around those reactors
yesterday , a government official said one of the reactors might be leaking radioactive material
tests on seawater showed some signs of contamination as well , about 360 miles out into the @entity50
and tests have shown small amounts of plutonium in the soil at different spots around the power plant , though the company that owns the plant says the plutonium is not a harmful amount
parts of @entity4 were shaken by another earthquake , though ; this one hit on monday
was n't nearly as strong as the quake from two weeks ago
but it did happen in the same general area as the march 11th quake , near the city of @entity67 on @entity4 's east coast
that 's where @entity70 is now for us
he 's at @entity67 's airport , looking at how its recovery is a sign of hope for the victims of these disasters
( begin video ) @entity81 , @entity0 correspondent : if you remember some of the most amazing images that came out in the first hours after the tsunami , one of them would have to be the airport in @entity67
it was just so amazing to see this massive airport overrun with water and debris
now , we 're going back to see how it looks today
but first , we have to avoid @entity4 's ongoing nuclear disaster
@entity95 , @entity96 special ops : this is the @entity33 reactor , the 25 - mile restricted area
this is our airplane here
@entity100 : colonel @entity101 was aboard the first plane to land at @entity67 after the tsunami
@entity104 : i think anything that you see on tv , well , @entity105 with their greatest special effects ca n't put into perspective the amount of destruction that was down there on the airfield the day that we arrived
@entity100 : sweeping in for landing ourselves , we see none of that
you can probably see that , for the most part , behind us it looks great
the transition is amazing given what happened here the day of the disaster
but get away from the runway and you see the reminders , which a literal army of 240 @entity134 airmen , soldiers and @entity136 , alongside @entity4 civilians , frantically worked to clear
by just dumb luck , there were no large passenger planes here when the wave hit , but hundreds of smaller , mostly private aircraft were n't so lucky
they look as though they fell from the sky
even ones in the hangers were n't spared
this is the main entrance here at @entity67
it 's like any normal @entity134 airport , only it 's not so normal now
@entity67 's an international hub
@entity4 officials had written the place off
did you think it would be able to be reopened ? @entity159 , @entity160 : to be honest , the answer is no. @entity100 : but it is open
it now serves as a center for humanitarian aid distribution
and guiding those planes from the same roof on which so many sought shelter , now stand @entity134 @entity96 air traffic controllers , who saw a tragedy and were able to help
@entity172 , @entity134 @entity96 combat controller : you feel kind of sad
then you know you 're here for a job and hopefully you can bring some relief to the @entity4 people
@entity100 : once an iconic image of a disaster , @entity180 has now been transformed into an early sign of hope
@entity70 , @entity0 , @entity67 , @entity4
( @entity185 ) crisis in @entity187 @entity30 : president @entity188 says the @entity134 role in @entity187 will get smaller as @entity190 takes control of the coalition operation
but @entity134 forces will still be involved
the question a lot of people are asking is why did the @entity134 get involved in the first place ? democrats and @entity199 have been criticizing the president
they 're asking about the purpose of the mission in @entity187 , the cost , and what it might mean for @entity134 's relationship with the @entity209 world
president @entity188 was scheduled to give a speech last night to address some of those concerns
it happened after we produced this show
we 're gon na have more details on that speech for you tomorrow
unrest in @entity218 @entity30 : in the @entity220 nation of @entity218 , a law that 's been on the books for nearly 50 years could soon be removed
it 's called the " emergency law
" what it does is allow the @entity218 government to make preventive arrests , meaning it can arrest people before they commit a crime
the decision to lift the law comes after protests against the country 's government
dozens of people have been killed in the fighting between protesters and @entity218 security forces
a lot of this violence has been happening in a couple cities in @entity218
the government blamed the violence in one of those cities , the one you see in these photos , on " armed gangs " who got a hold of police weapons
@entity254 @entity255 , @entity15 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an island nation located in the @entity258
communist forces took over my government in 1959
i 'm less than 100 miles away from the @entity134 , but i 've had a tense relationship with @entity134 for decades
i 'm @entity6 , and my capital city is @entity264
pres. @entity265 in @entity6 @entity30 : and that 's where former @entity134 president @entity265 is right now
he 's in the middle of a three - day visit to the communist nation of @entity6
president @entity265 arrived on monday
he was invited by @entity6 president @entity272 , whom he 's scheduled to meet with today
yesterday , @entity265 met with religious leaders and @entity134 officials
it 's not the former @entity134 president 's first trip to @entity6
@entity278 looks at what 's on the agenda for former president @entity265 and how this trip will be different from his last visit to the island nation
( begin video ) @entity287 , @entity288 , havana : when @entity265 arrived on his last visit to @entity6 , @entity290 himself was on the tarmac to greet the former @entity134 president
he 's the only @entity134 leader , in or out of office , to visit the island since @entity272 's 1959 revolution
@entity265 will be back on a private mission to talk about ways to improve @entity134 - @entity6 relations with the new president , @entity272
in some ways , the time is ripe
@entity272 has introduced sweeping changes to the @entity306 - style economy
@entity6 freed the last of 75 dissidents jailed in a 2003 crackdown on the opposition that prompted worldwide condemnation
@entity312 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for counter-revolutionary activities , but freed this month
@entity312 , cuban dissident [ @entity316 ] : " i want to continue my work in the defense of human rights , " he says
" we want a democratic and free society
" @entity323 : @entity272 agreed to release the prisoners last year as part of a deal brokered by the @entity327 and @entity328 , removing one of the major obstacles to improved relations with the @entity134
but you would n't know it from president @entity188 's speech
he talked about changes in @entity134 policy toward @entity6 that he 's made , and the need for reciprocal action
@entity134 president @entity188 : @entity6 authorities must take some meaningful actions to respect the basic rights of their own people , not because the @entity134 insists upon it , but because the people of @entity6 deserve it
@entity323 : part of the reason for the impasse between the nations is @entity350 , a @entity352 contractor who was arrested in @entity264 in 2009
this month , @entity350 was sentenced to 15 years in jail for his work on what @entity6 saw as a " subversive " program hooking dissidents up to the internet
the @entity134 said he was merely helping the @entity361 community
no doubt , expectations will run high that @entity265 will try to secure the early release for @entity350
but at least officially , it 's not even on the three - day agenda for the former president
( @entity185 ) is this legit ? @entity367 , @entity15 : is this legit ? @entity369 's @entity368 is played every two years
nope ! not true ! the @entity368 occurs once every four years
@entity370 ? @entity30 : in the summer of 2022 , the @entity372 nation of @entity7 will host the @entity368
this is a country where the temperatures in the @entity375 are normally triple digits , so engineers are working on ways for fans and players to beat the heat
it 's a robotic cloud made out of carbon fibers
officials are planning to put together a prototype this year , and this animation shows you how it might work
engines would help the robo - cloud get off the ground
and officials would plan to use remote controls to position the cloud between the stadium and the sun. will it work ? engineers have 11 years to find out for sure
before we go @entity30 : finally , in a cross-state battle , someone 's about to get their just desserts
and it looks like it 's going to be @entity406 , thanks to the world 's biggest whoopie pie
this is basically a giant cookie sandwich with fluffy filling in the middle
delicious ! @entity406 and @entity413 were jawing over which state could claim it as their dessert
@entity413 's largest : more than 200 pounds
this one in @entity406 : more than a thousand ! goodbye @entity30 : no matter how you slice it , that victory is sweet
i 'm sure it took a while to bake something so big
but if you ask the chefs , they 'd probably say it was easy as pie
we 've eaten up all our time for today
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity26 .
