-- the @entity1 seems a long time ago
the voices of @entity6 and @entity7 , the uprising in @entity9 , the street protests in @entity3 and @entity4 promised a popular awakening in countries where politics had been confined to an elite
the @entity15 democracies -- if a little hesitantly -- took the side of the demonstrators
but with the exception of @entity24 , their contribution to the @entity22 world 's new beginning comprised moral support and the promise of financial help once new governments were formed
the @entity29 used some of its substantial political clout in the region to ease @entity33 and @entity35 @entity34 out of power in @entity37 and @entity38 respectively
" soft power " -- advice , mediation , persuasion and some aid -- was leveraged to influence events ; the use of " hard power " as in @entity42 was not even contemplated
as president @entity48 put it in a speech in @entity51 in june 2009 , " events in @entity42 have reminded @entity29 of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible
" indeed , we can recall the words of @entity60 , who said , ' i hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power , the greater it will be , ' " he said
the president 's then - defense secretary , @entity65 , expanded on the theme , saying that more needed to be spent on " diplomacy , strategic communications , foreign assistance , civic action and economic reconstruction and development
" opinion : for @entity29 , @entity75 is truly a problem from hell the @entity48 administration has sought to reduce the @entity29 military footprint abroad , pulling all @entity29 troops out of @entity42 and setting a timetable for the withdrawal of combat troops from @entity84
it is wary of the use of military power for all but the most forensic of operations ( the raid that killed @entity90 ) or those that achieve defined aims at next to no political cost ( drones over @entity3 )
rare and rapid international agreement , blessed at the @entity98 , allowed for a swift military response to prevent a bloodbath in @entity9 , which had been taken over by opponents of the @entity103 regime
the targets -- most of them along a strip of the @entity107 coast -- were poorly defended and easily hit from the sea or airbases in @entity110
even so , @entity112 warplanes flew 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce a no - fly zone
and the result of all that military investment was a few weeks of euphoria with the ousting of @entity103 -- and many months since of chronic volatility , as groups sympathetic to @entity121 have sown chaos and turf wars have sapped the new government 's authority
before his death in @entity9 in september , ambassador @entity127 ' own communications revealed huge frustration and some anxiety about the proliferation of militia and growing violence in @entity24
this week , @entity134 of the @entity135 , a longtime watcher of jihadism in @entity138 , wrote that one of the main militant groups , @entity147 , " has been taking advantage of the lack of state control by building local communal ties , which is strengthening its ability to operate in more locations than @entity9
" forcible intervention by superior powers can quickly demolish regimes that lack legitimacy
but in societies where there is no tradition of civic society or democracy , deep sectarian or ethnic fissures and desperate economic problems , helping to fashion the new is an almost overwhelming demand
while @entity29 troops remained in @entity42 , @entity161 and @entity162 political groups had to obey some rules of the road , and @entity166 had to exercise its influence discreetly
but since their departure , sectarian violence has surged to its worst levels in five years
when a group believes that it is in an existential struggle , it is unlikely to heed the advice of diplomats who soon will leave for home
@entity37 's multilayered problems -- political , economic and demographic -- defy any short - term solution
there are more than 80 million @entity37 , most of them close to or below the poverty line and under the age of 25
faint hopes for a democratic alternative to @entity33 have been snuffed out
concerted diplomacy failed to persuade president @entity187 to be " inclusive , " as @entity48 put it , or take critical economic decisions
after @entity187 was ousted , back - corridor pleas to the @entity37 military to avoid civilian casualties , not declare a state of emergency and open new channels of dialogue all fell on deaf ears
missile strikes on @entity75 likely response to chemical attack @entity48 's preference for diplomacy and international consensus goes only so far , especially when there 's so little common ground that a @entity29 - @entity206 summit is not even worth holding
but there is no appetite in the @entity209 for more muscular nation - ( re ) building , especially after the experiences of @entity84 and @entity42
@entity48 recognized this when he said in @entity51 in 2009 , " no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other
" such campaigns are unpopular at home and very costly , demanding multiyear commitments for very little reward
groups that were at each other 's throats suddenly turn their fire on a common enemy : the invader
many observers expect that is exactly what would happen in @entity75 if there was a full - throated military intervention
and pacifying a country with so many weapons , so many open borders and so many sectarian fault lines would demand a force larger than the 168,000 combat troops deployed to @entity42 at the peak of the @entity29 commitment
that is not on the agenda
so the use of " hard power " in @entity75 would be limited to punishment strikes on the grounds that " something must be done
" such strikes would begin to degrade the @entity251 regime 's military infrastructure and discourage it from using chemical weapons but would probably not tip the military balance decisively
and they may become politically unavoidable if the @entity98 inspectors who have gone to @entity256 find irrefutable evidence that chemical weapons killed hundreds of people last week
they would also be welcomed by the regime 's opponents in the hope that more would follow
but they would be a metaphoric slap on the wrist
there is no " exit " or " end " strategy in such strikes , and it seems likely that hardline @entity269 groups would be best placed to take advantage of a weakening @entity251 regime
there is the faint chance that proof of the regime 's use of chemical weapons would oblige @entity206 and @entity281 to at least modify their resistance at the @entity284 to a tougher stance against @entity251
but turning that into a common position would demand exceptionally deft diplomacy
the @entity15 powers are not impotent in the @entity290
in @entity37 , the generals ' long relationship with their @entity29 counterparts ( and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing ) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past
the @entity29 and @entity299 can also join the @entity300 in providing emergency aid to @entity37 ( the @entity302 and others have already pledged $ 15 billion )
in @entity75 , @entity304 can continue to cajole the moderate opposition to behave more coherently and reassert itself in the face of the @entity308 ' rise
it can continue to work with the government of @entity3 in targeting @entity121 operatives in more remote areas with drones
in @entity38 , there is still an influential , moderate strand in the ruling @entity269 party , @entity316 , and a strong middle class with a secular outlook
the leaders of both countries have recently been in @entity304
but as age - old sectarian and religious hatreds rage across much of the @entity290 , from @entity323 in northern @entity324 to @entity323 in @entity24 , there is little more that outsiders can do but wait for the volcano to finish erupting .
