-- almost two years after @entity2 plunged into the southern @entity3 killing all 228 people aboard , investigators have released a report on what they believe caused the crash
after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles , the aircraft 's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found on the ocean floor at the beginning of may
after analyzing the data , @entity16 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) released its report friday saying the flight from @entity20 to @entity21 crashed because the aircraft 's speed sensors gave invalid readings
when did @entity2 go down ? flight 447 -- which was en route to @entity21 from @entity20 -- made its last contact with @entity29 's @entity28 ( @entity30 ) at around 01:33 gmt on june 1 , 2009 , informing the center of the plane 's position as it crossed the @entity3
investigators : @entity36 crash data recovered soon after , @entity29 's air control contacted @entity40 's control center in @entity41 and reported that @entity2 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence , officials said
there was no further contact with the plane
why has it taken so long to find the wreckage ? the area where the @entity52 went down is in the @entity53 -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in @entity29 or @entity56 in @entity57
the @entity59 @entity58 estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters ( about 9,840 feet ) to 7,500 meters ( 24,600 feet )
@entity29 officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters ( 6,562 to 9,842 feet )
the latest search covered a 46 - mile ( 75 - kilometer ) radius around the last known position of @entity2 , investigators said
according to the @entity15 the underwater terrain in this area is rough with underwater mountains and valleys
" it is a mountain range as big as the @entity75 , " @entity70 of @entity71 told @entity0 before the release of friday 's report
" there was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse
this is not a flat - bottom environment like the @entity83 is
" " therefore it is an unprecedented search in terms of depth and sub-sea terrain
" what would happen to wreckage at these depths ? up until recently , the memory module of the aircraft 's data recorder -- a vital device for crash investigators which records any instructions sent to the aircraft 's electronic systems -- had been missing
as a result , some experts feared it would not work even if recovered
" pressure and corrosion have likely damaged the wreckage , especially as it has been down there for so long , " said @entity70
" flight recorders are not designed to withstand pressures of the depths that this aircraft actually went to
" but he warned that flight recorders recovered from other crash sites have not worked when they should have , with the reverse also true
do we know why @entity2 crashed ? the @entity15 report findings say the airplane climbed to 38,000 ft when " the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled
" it then descended , crashing into the @entity3
the descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational , said the report
studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the @entity15 to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the @entity15 said in a 2009 report
tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes , which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed
before it crashed , @entity2 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms , officials have said
the @entity146 issued a directive in late august requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by @entity150 on @entity151 and @entity152
it said airlines should replace them with other @entity150 tubes and those manufactured by @entity158
the lack of speed , wind or direction information also prevented the autopilot system from functioning , said air accident investigator @entity164 said at the time of the crash
" this tells us that the plane has to be , in this case , directed by the pilot , " he said
what about the weather ? flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the @entity177 ( @entity177 ) , when it went down
the @entity177 is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet
clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world 's hemispheres meet
here , air and water temperatures are typically in the mid- 80s
the warm , moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. steamy air , coming off the ocean , rises until it hits cooler , drier air aloft , forming clouds and thunderstorms
these gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph
the height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air
even if you stacked two dozen of the world 's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other , they still would n't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the @entity177
however @entity70 pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the @entity177 every day without incident
" there was another @entity216 flight 30 minutes behind @entity2 that night and it encountered no problems , " he said
any other theories ? according to @entity70 , many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor
" the crash happened at around 2 am on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out
" he said the crew , possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point , suddenly have this problem and they " fixate " on it
" this is a syndrome , " he said
" there have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem
now we do n't know that , but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully
" whether it was out of control -- and i doubt this -- it was not being controlled
imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem
they do n't have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem
they fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped
" the airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent -- the pilots do n't notice as it is all very gentle
and when they look up they do n't believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and ca n't recover
" he highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a @entity266 737 - 300 to crash in the @entity267 shortly after take off from the @entity269 resort of @entity270
though @entity269 authorities disputed the claim , aviation safety officials in @entity16 and the @entity59 cited " spatial disorientation " as the likely cause based on evidence available , according to the @entity276 ( @entity276 ) .
