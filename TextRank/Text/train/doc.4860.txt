the complaining passengers were predominantly non-english - speaking women of @entity56 descent and nationality who were returning to @entity56 after visiting the @entity7 , according to the complaint
authorities launched an investigation , including video surveillance of the checkpoint
@entity11 told authorities tuesday that " he had considered harming himself , " assistant @entity7 attorney @entity66 told magistrate judge @entity67
@entity11 's public defender , @entity68 , said his client would not harm himself and was not a flight risk
" he has too much to live for
" @entity11 's colleague , identified in the complaint as the " co-schemer , " began cooperating with authorities in september 2010 and told police he has been stealing from passengers at the checkpoint since about october 2009
the colleague said that he and @entity11 had agreed that when he stole from passengers , he would " kick up " half the money to @entity81
@entity11 also regularly stole from passengers himself , sometimes giving his colleague some of that money , according to the complaint
between september 13 and october 5 , @entity11 accepted a total of $ 3,100 from the colleague , the complaint said
in an audiotaped conversation , @entity11 told the colleague he did not feel bad stealing from foreigners , as they were " leaving this country with our money , " according to the complaint
the colleague told police he would steal , on average , $ 400 to $ 700 a day from passengers and gave @entity81 $ 200 to $ 400 , the complaint said
meanwhile , he said @entity11 usually stole $ 400 to $ 700 a day , sharing some of it at times
on august 31 , @entity11 stole $ 400 from a female passenger of @entity56 descent by conducting a search of her bag , according to the complaint
the woman noticed the money missing after passing through the checkpoint , and approached a senior special agent with the @entity113 to report it , the documents said
the agent left the woman to investigate , but saw @entity11 approach the woman , along with a police officer
@entity11 told the woman someone else had found the money on the floor and gave it to him , and returned it
however , the complaint said , an @entity39 representative had told @entity11 's colleague that the woman had reported the theft and that a police officer was taking a report from her
" the co-schemer knew that he had not committed that particular theft and therefore believed @entity11 must have done it , so the co-schemer immediately called @entity11 on his cell phone to alert him , " the complaint said
both @entity11 and the colleague are shown stealing money from passengers on video surveillance , according to the complaint , and video surveillance showed @entity11 accepting $ 100 bills on numerous occasions from the colleague
surveillance from september 29 shows the colleague pulling about $ 1,000 from an envelope and giving @entity11 $ 500 , " which @entity11 accepted while laughing and then put into his front shirt pocket , " the complaint said
" @entity11 then gave the middle finger to a visible security camera in the [ transportation security officers ' ] office
" in audio recordings made october 5 , the colleague told @entity11 that he took a " full envelope " from a passenger and put it in the security office next to the checkpoint , according to the complaint
" @entity11 instructed the co-schemer to go to the airport gate where the passenger was scheduled to depart to make sure that the passenger departed the airport without noticing that their money was missing , " the complaint said
" after the co-schemer told @entity11 that the passenger had departed , @entity11 accepted $ 900 from the co-schemer
" authorities executed a search warrant to search @entity11 that same day , and found $ 1,300 in his pants pocket
" the serial numbers on $ 1,100 of the money recovered from @entity11 matched the serial numbers on the money that was provided to the co-schemer by law enforcement to give to @entity11 earlier that day , " the complaint said
an additional $ 100 matched the serial number of a bill police gave the colleague the day earlier , and @entity11 told authorities he had used another $ 100 to buy groceries , according to the documents
between 2003 , and wednesday , 162 @entity26 employees were terminated or removed from duty for theft from passengers or luggage at checkpoints , according to the agency
the @entity26 said that number is a small fraction of those who were employed during that time
" @entity26 holds its security officers to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero - tolerance policy for theft in the workplace , " said @entity26 spokesman @entity200
" we investigate any allegation of misconduct
when infractions are discovered , we move quickly to terminate the employment of offenders
it 's sad that the reprehensible conduct of a few individuals threatens to tarnish the 50,000 honest , hard - working folks from all walks of life whose patriotism ensures the security of millions of people every single day
