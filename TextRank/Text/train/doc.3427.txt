-- he 's one of the poster boys of the @entity3 , which is being staged a few miles down the road from where he grew up , and soccer star @entity7 has confirmed to @entity0 he will have a role in friday 's glittering opening ceremony
the @entity11 midfielder , who has also played for @entity12 and @entity13 , has played a pivotal role in bringing the @entity15 to his hometown but was controversially omitted from @entity18 's football squad last month
@entity7 was on hand to welcome the @entity15 torch to the @entity22 capital from @entity23 before it embarked on a 70 - day tour around the @entity25 but has ruled out the possibility of lighting the flame inside the @entity28 , saying that honor should be bestowed upon a person who has competed at the @entity15
the 37 - year - old told @entity32 that he would play a cameo role in friday 's ceremony to officially open the @entity3 , which is due to be watched by billions around the globe , but was tight lipped when asked what his part in film director @entity38 's show would entail
the 10 strangest @entity15 sports " no , i 'm not allowed to , " he said
" but it 's exciting , i 'm excited to be part of such a huge occasion for our country and for everybody involved in these games
" it 's exciting to have the @entity15 in the @entity51 of @entity52 and for myself to be part of that , i 'm very honored
" @entity7 confirmed that his role would not include children , animals or footballs , but when asked if a flame might be involved he replied : " i think i might have one
" the former @entity60 star , who has 115 caps for his country , was part of @entity52 's bid team that won the right to stage the biggest sporting spectacle on earth back in 2005 and has worked closely with @entity15 organizers since
@entity7 was born in @entity69 , just three miles from the site of the @entity28 , and said anticipation was building as @entity52 prepares to present to the world an event that has been seven long years in the planning
" it was seven years when this whole process started and being part of bringing the @entity15 to a part of @entity52 where i grew up , its exciting to see everything come together , " he added
" i was at the stadium yesterday -- i 've not been there for a few months -- and to see the change that has happened and also to see the change that 's happened around the area , it 's really incredible
" you can feel the atmosphere building around the stadium now , it 's great to see the athletes arrive and the interest become bigger
" @entity7 had been preparing to participate in the @entity15 , as one of three players over the age of 23 allowed in @entity18 's football squad , but he was controversially left out by coach @entity97
though he missed out on competing , @entity7 says he will try and take his family to as many events as possible , despite trying to juggle his commitments back in @entity101 with the @entity11
he also implored the whole of the @entity25 to get behind their athletes as they attempt to thrive under the pressure of performing in front of what is sure to be a partisan home crowd
" i 'm interested in all the @entity18 athletes , " he said
" i think it 's important for us to support every one of them
it 's such a huge sporting occasion -- we 've got so much talent in our country it 's exciting to have so much on display
" obviously , i 've got a busy week but there will be a few events i 'm hoping to get to and take my kids down to so it will be fun , hopefully
" since @entity7 left @entity13 in 2003 he has been based away from the @entity25 , winning a @entity123 title in the last of his four seasons with @entity12 before moving to the @entity11 in 2007
and though he says his family have been warmly welcomed by the public in the @entity101 since they made the move across the @entity129 , there is no doubt who the @entity7 household will be rooting for to win more medals
" oh no , ( my family 's ) loyalty obviously lies with @entity18 but they 'll still be supporting the @entity101 team because we 've lived there now for six years , we 've been bought in by the @entity101 public and people in @entity141 " @entity7 faces a hectic schedule during the @entity15 , none more so than this week where he will return to the @entity101 from @entity52 to play for the @entity146 @entity145 against @entity148 winners @entity147 before jetting back for friday 's opening ceremony
but it is a price he is willing to pay to be involved in both showpiece occasions
" it is what it is , " he said
" it 's my life , i would n't change it or swap it for anything
obviously , i did n't think i was going to be able to make the @entity146 @entity145 game but fortunately i can fly over , fly in and fly out
" it 's exciting because i 'm very proud to be involved in the all - star game and to be picked again this year
coming up against @entity147 , the @entity148 winners , it 's an exciting thing to be involved in
" one of his commitments in the build up to the @entity15 was to attend an event with former world heavyweight boxing champion , and @entity15 gold medallist , @entity168 , a man he regards as one of the greatest sportsmen of all time
" i do n't think there is a bigger sporting icon in the history of sport than @entity168 , " he explained
" he stood for so many amazing things and did so many amazing things , his whole career and his whole life was about survival whether it was boxing , whether it was his life in general , whether it was outside of the ring , it was always about survival and for me he 's the most amazing sportsman i 've ever met
