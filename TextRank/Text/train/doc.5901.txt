a three - judge panel court on tuesday acquitted @entity2 pitcher @entity1 of charges in the shooting death of a man in his hometown
@entity1 was charged with involuntary murder in the death of @entity9 , 25 , and with injuring the victim 's cousin @entity10 , 17 , early on january 1 in the nearby town of @entity13
defense attorneys argued that the prosecution failed to prove @entity1 fired the pistol that killed @entity10 , who he said was a childhood friend , during a @entity19 celebration
prosecutors claimed that @entity1 had bribed witnesses , including the wounded cousin , who on tuesday appeared less certain that @entity1 was the shooter than he had been in previous statements to police and the media
prosecutors said they will wait for the official verdict to be released but plan to appeal to the regional appellate court in @entity30
in the @entity32 , prosecutors can appeal an acquittal to a higher court within 20 working days
@entity1 faces a 10 - year sentence on the charges
the 30 - year - old right - hander started 23 games for the @entity2 this season and posted a record of 4 - 9 with a 4.90 earned - run average
according to local news website gentetuya.com , @entity1 is expected to sign a $ 12 million contract with the @entity2 .
