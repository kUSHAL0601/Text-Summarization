@entity1 motorsport maestros @entity2 want to get back to being " bellissimo " in @entity3 next month after two team errors saw their no. 1 driver @entity5 fall behind in the race for the @entity8 title
@entity5 dropped to fourth in the drivers ' championship -- and 30 points behind the leader , @entity14 's reigning champion @entity13 -- after his race in @entity16 was compromised by problems with his car 's rear - wing overtaking aid
the @entity20 also crashed out of the @entity22 @entity21 when the team failed to call him back to the pits to repair a damaged front wing that had slipped dangerously underneath his car
the mistakes mean @entity2 -- who have not won the team title since 2008 -- are now third in the constructor standings behind @entity14 and @entity31
after the first four long - haul destination races of 2013 , the team have returned to their @entity35 headquarters in northern @entity1 where team principal @entity36 has issued a rallying call to the famous racing marque
" we have to be perfect in every area , " he said
" responsibility lies with reliability , from the smallest to the biggest components , to ensure the level of perfection that has to be the standard for @entity2
we must work with renewed attention on this front
" that extra attention to detail has already begun at the @entity2 factory as the team 's engineers solved the problem with @entity5 's faulty drag reduction system ( @entity56 ) -- an overtaking aid which increases the car 's straight - line speed by flipping open the top flap of the rear wing -- the day after the @entity62
analysis revealed the problem was caused by a broken mechanical component
@entity2 say it was the first of its kind in the three years since @entity56 was introduced to @entity8
but the team say there is still work to be done , especially as @entity2 's @entity71 driver @entity70 also had a torrid race in @entity16 , finishing 15th because of tire problems
@entity5 had started the race in third place but battled his way to eighth after stopping twice so mechanics could mend his car 's faulty rear wing
" it 's hard to recall a race where so many things went wrong , " commented @entity80
" the @entity56 failure prevented @entity5 , who yet again produced a great performance , from fighting @entity13 for the win
" then for @entity70 , there were the two tire - related problems that pushed him out of the points and prevented him from getting the top - five finish that was within his grasp
" in these first four races of the season we have not managed , for various reasons , to bring home the points that were within our grasp
that 's why the gap to the top in both classifications seems quite large
" strong performances in @entity103 and @entity104 , where @entity5 raced to a dominant victory for @entity2 , continue to give @entity2 hope that they can still challenge their main rivals @entity14 , @entity31 and @entity108 in the title hunt when racing resumes in the @entity112 city of @entity3 on may 12
" we believe in our ability to be in the fight for the titles right to the end and this time , we have been in that fight since the start , which has not been the case for a while , " said @entity80
" we must not be discouraged , quite the contrary , because we have seen so often , both in our favor and against , how things can change in a hurry
