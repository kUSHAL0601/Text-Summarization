-- the @entity1 in @entity2 said friday it was " extremely disappointed " by a @entity4 court decision to uphold the eight - year prison sentence of @entity7 citizen @entity6
" i am extremely disappointed in the outcome although it was n't completely unexpected , " said @entity7 ambassador to @entity4 @entity9
" we ask the @entity4 government to consider an immediate humanitarian parole of @entity6 thereby allowing him to get back to his family and his way of life
" the geologist , a naturalized @entity7 citizens , was convicted on charges of violating state secrets and faces a fine of 200,000 yuan ( about u.s. $ 30,400 )
@entity6 has spent about three years in prison since his arrest
@entity26 's dr. @entity25 , @entity6 's former professor who has rallied for his release , said in july that @entity6 was languishing in prison on vague charges
" i find this whole thing just unbelievable in no small part because the rationale is just so thoroughly flawed , " @entity25 said
@entity6 " has always been a straight shooter , " @entity25 said
" he was not ... a wheeler - dealer type
" he is " an honest , hard worker and this came as a real surprise to him as well
" @entity6 was working in @entity4 as a leading geologist for the @entity40 - based @entity39 , a global provider of energy - related information , @entity25 said , and the information @entity6 was privy to did not include state secrets
while @entity25 said he was not privy to the specific database mentioned in @entity6 's indictment , the professor said the pieces of information commonly contained in such databases are not state secrets
" these types of databases usually contain information related to the petroleum potential of a given area , and that might include what wells already have been drilled and information on the geology and geophysical or underlying structure of these areas
that 's pretty much it , " he said
@entity6 's job as a leading consultant for @entity39 involved acquiring and reselling this type of data , @entity25 said
he said that as a petroconsultant , @entity6 thought he was viewed favorably by the @entity4 because he was able to sell to @entity4 officials similar data from countries in which the @entity4 had drilling interests
@entity25 said @entity6 had resigned from @entity39 at the time of his arrest and believed that the warnings issued by @entity4 officials concerning the database were not issued against him , but against his employers , he said
" @entity39 is extremely disappointed at the news and is very sympathetic to the situation
we are continuing to work with our advisors on the issue , " @entity39 spokesman @entity85 at the time of @entity6 's sentencing in july
