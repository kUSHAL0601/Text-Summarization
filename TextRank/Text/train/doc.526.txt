-- despite the election cycle rhetoric surrounding immigration , which would make it seem like the rest of the world is swarming across @entity8 borders like ants to a picnic , gobbling up our resources , the reality is quite different
there are a number of myths that we must dispel in order to forge a sound policy , or else we risk our own potential downfall in the long run
the first myth is that @entity8 continues to be a nation of immigrants
the second is that everyone who is thinking of emigrating wants to come to the @entity8 @entity27 is the idea that we beat the competition in attracting the best and brightest immigrants
lastly is the belief that immigrants end up as a burden on our economy
all of these false notions shape public perception and reaction to immigration reform
if we are to succeed in the next century , we need to base our decisions on facts
while @entity8 at one point had a huge influx of immigrants , today the picture is quite different
according to the @entity47 , the number of immigrants is almost four times what it was 100 years ago
but if we look at it as a percentage of the total @entity8 population , we see that it is about 13 % , which is not an all - time high
as recently as 20 years ago , @entity8 was the premier destination of all aspiring immigrants
today , this is no longer the case
as a percentage of population , @entity61 and @entity62 both have significantly higher rates of foreign - born residents than the @entity8 , at approximately 20 % and 26 % respectively
in fact , @entity8 's rate of foreign - born population -- about 13 % -- is now on par with those of @entity71 and @entity72
@entity8 also no longer draws the smartest people from around the world
compared with countries like @entity61 , @entity76 and @entity62 , the @entity8 has a greater proportion of low - skilled rather than high - skilled immigrants
about 30 % of immigrants in the @entity8 possess a low level of education , and only 35 % possess a high level of education
in @entity61 , only 22 % of immigrants have a low level of education , while more than 46 % have a high level of education
countries like @entity61 attract a greater influx of immigrants with higher education levels and specialized skills through immigration policies that specifically favor visa applicants with advanced degrees or work experience
in contrast , @entity8 policies place more emphasis on family relationships and less consideration on skills or education levels when granting permanent residence
perhaps the most persistent modern immigration myth is that immigrants are a drain on our economy , which is simply not true
taxes paid by immigrants and their children -- both legal and illegal -- exceed the costs of the services they use
a 2007 report from the @entity117 concluded that immigration as a whole increases the @entity8 gdp by roughly $ 37 billion each year
a cost estimate by the @entity122 in 2007 found that a path to legalization for unauthorized immigrants would increase federal revenues by $ 48 billion but would incur only $ 23 billion of increased costs from public services , producing a surplus of $ 25 billion for government coffers
and according to a @entity132 report , increases in immigration have improved @entity132 's finances
the consensus of the economic analysis is that the taxes paid by immigrants and their descendants exceed the benefits they receive
even with undocumented immigrants , the @entity140 estimates that they paid almost $ 50 billion in federal taxes between 1996 to 2003 , including payroll and @entity132 ( about $ 8.5 billion per year ) , property ( directly or as part of rental payments ) and sales taxes
nonetheless , about 40 % of undocumented immigrants ( @entity149 ) currently work off the books and consequently pay lower taxes
but if we look at their purchasing power , we find that undocumented immigrants sustain hundreds of thousand of @entity8 jobs
one study estimates ( @entity149 ) that @entity158 buying power totaled $ 951 billion in 2008 and will increase to $ 1.4 trillion by 2013
@entity160 buying power totaled $ 509.1 billion in 2008 and is expected to increase to $ 752.3 billion by 2013
countries such as @entity61 and @entity62 realized earlier that immigration policy is intrinsically linked to their economic success
where @entity8 immigration policy attempts to address economic realities is in the @entity168 visa classification for highly skilled workers
however , the caps , quotas and numbers do n't really work
ten weeks after the application filing period opened for @entity168 visas for fiscal year 2013 , @entity173 had reached the statutory cap
many @entity8 companies are struggling to fill 3.6 million job openings in the @entity8 , many of them in science - and technology - related fields
the cap stifles economic growth for 10 months until the next @entity168 visa application filing period begins
" the continued failure to devise and implement a sound and sustainable immigration policy threatens to weaken @entity8 's economy , to jeopardize its diplomacy , and to imperil its national security , " concludes a @entity186 report co-chaired by former @entity188 gov. @entity187 and former clinton white house chief of staff @entity189
just as a teenager grows up and dismisses the simplistic views espoused in the fairy tales of childhood , so too must we as a nation face the reality that we are no longer the world leader in welcoming talent
we still have a good chance in regaining the monopoly of what made our nation so great in the first place : a clustering of the best and the brightest from around the world
