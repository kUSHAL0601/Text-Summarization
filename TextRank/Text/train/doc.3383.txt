and jeers from the @entity5
when @entity8 president @entity7 announced the annexation of @entity12 's @entity11 region tuesday and signed a formal decree , he made a major @entity15 crisis almost irreversible
his nation 's lawmakers wept and gave him a standing ovation in parliament as he barraged the @entity5 for what he described as its numerous betrayals
but in @entity5 capitals , there was no applause
governments imposed sanctions on @entity8 leaders and warned that 's just the beginning
here 's the rationalization for @entity7 's decision , and the reasoning for the @entity5 's derision
point @entity11 rightfully belongs to @entity8 former @entity37 leader @entity36 gave @entity11 to @entity12 in 1954
at the time , no one thought the @entity37 would collapse , @entity7 said
and @entity11 was handed over " like a sack of potatoes , " @entity12 's @entity40 said
now the people have spoken , and they want to be a part of @entity8 , @entity7 said , referring to a hastily - called weekend referendum on separating from @entity12
" in our hearts , we know @entity11 has always been an inalienable part of @entity8 , " he said
@entity49 no , it does n't @entity12 prime minister @entity51 called the annexation " a robbery on an international scale , " one that his nation will never accept
president @entity57 and other @entity15 allies have accused @entity2 of violating @entity12 's sovereignty and independence
@entity11 , which has an ethnic @entity8 majority , has long been a semiautonomous region within @entity12
it had its own @entity63 , but @entity12 had veto power over its actions
" one country has come and temporarily stolen part of the territory of an independent country , " @entity51 said
--- point @entity8 had no choice but to act @entity12 's new government , backed by the @entity74 and @entity15 powers , prepared " to seize the state through terror and murders , " @entity7 said
what was @entity8 to do ? he asked
" the main executors of this were nationalists , @entity8 - phobes and anti-semites , " he said
" those people define what is happening today in @entity12
" @entity49 @entity8 saw a chance and pounced international observers said @entity2 saw its chance to annex a strategic territory and took it
the region is pretty significant : it still hosts the home port of @entity8 's @entity93
@entity7 is " mimicking the fascists of the last century " by annexing @entity11 , @entity12 president @entity94 said
and he has goals , some analysts say
" his project for his third term as president is to gather in as many of his neighbors as he can to form a new @entity104 , " said @entity98 , a professor at the @entity99
" @entity12 is the key to that project
and @entity11 is the key to @entity12
" --- point the annexation 's legal the @entity8 leader accused the @entity5 of " double standards " in its response to the @entity11 crisis , citing @entity117 's split from @entity118
in 1999 , @entity119 conducted a two - month bombing campaign to separate @entity117 's @entity122 population from the rest of @entity118
the @entity74 supported the breakaway
" it 's absolutely in favor of their own interests -- black today , white tomorrow , " @entity7 said
he said anyone who would allow @entity117 to split from @entity118 and not @entity11 from @entity12 would be showing " absolute cynicism
" @entity49 the annexation 's illegal the @entity74 said @entity8 's justifications for taking @entity11 amount to an attack on @entity12 's sovereignty
" president @entity7 today gave a speech rewriting history , and it only further put him on the wrong side of history , " @entity74 secretary of state @entity136 said
preceding the 1999 @entity119 campaign , ethnic albanians were being slaughtered
@entity11 's ethnic @entity8 were not facing the same prospect
--- - point the rest of @entity12 's safe even though there are @entity8 troops and vehicles along the border , @entity7 says there are no plans to take any more territories from @entity12
@entity49 the rest of @entity12 's under threat @entity12 stands at " the beginning of a very dangerous conflict , and we should do our best to stop this process , " said @entity161 , a former foreign minister and a leading potential candidate for president
" several weeks ago , we had a guarantee that nothing ( would ) happen with the @entity11 , " he told @entity0 's @entity164
" now under attack can be any country in the @entity169 , including other parts of @entity12
" --- point @entity8 will pay @entity74 , @entity172 and @entity104 officials imposed sanctions on more than two dozen @entity8 and @entity11 officials
they include visa bans and frozen assets
" president @entity7 should be in no doubt that @entity8 will face more serious consequences , and i will push @entity15 leaders to agree further @entity104 measures when we meet on thursday , " @entity178 prime minister @entity177 said
@entity74 vice president @entity185 said @entity8 faces more than just sanctions
" we 're talking about @entity8 putting itself on a path that undermines long - term confidence and creates obstacles for its full participation in the global economy , " he said
" that path that they 've placed themselves on does nothing to help the next generation of @entity8 compete and succeed in a world that will be led by the most dynamic and open economies
" but @entity98 said maintaining warm ties with the @entity74 is not a priority for @entity7
@entity8 's granting of @entity205 leaker @entity204 asylum clearly shows that
" guaranteeing and expanding the @entity8 presence in @entity11 is much more important , " she said
@entity49 sanctions wo n't hurt @entity8 's taking the threats lightly
@entity211 , a @entity7 aide named in the sanctions , called it " a great honor " to be singled out for @entity74 punishment
" we wait for sanctions , " deputy prime minister @entity215 posted on @entity216
the message included a smiley face and a picture of a black bear , vodka and a rifle
biographer @entity224 said a country that can produce almost anything has no fear for sanctions
" it is absolutely not in the @entity74 interest to impose sanctions on @entity8 , because who will take @entity74 astronauts to space if not us @entity8 ? " @entity224 asked
and the sanctions are a good indicator of how far this battle will go -- or rather not go
" the so - called smart sanctions ... in response to events in @entity11 were an anti-climax and a confirmation of a total lack of any desire on the part of the @entity5 to take the fight with @entity8 any further , " said @entity239 , a former @entity240 adviser
--- - point this means war after a member of its military was killed and more captured when masked gunmen seized their base near the @entity11 regional capital , @entity259 , @entity12 's defense ministry authorized its forces to open fire
it warned that the crisis was shifting from political to military , and blamed it on @entity8
@entity49 no one wants war " if there were an armed conflict , neither the @entity74 nor @entity119 would get militarily involved , " @entity98 said
" and the result could be the dismemberment of @entity12 and its division into two states on either side of a new @entity277 divide
" instead , the @entity5 should offer @entity12 's interim government financial support and encourage it " not to let itself be provoked into a war with @entity8 as @entity281 was in 2008
" --- point this will isolate @entity8 it 's not yet evident whether the sanctions will turn @entity8 into a pariah nation , but the @entity74 has issued warnings to @entity2
" @entity8 military intervention in @entity12 will only deepen @entity8 's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the @entity8 economy , " president @entity57 said
@entity49 @entity7 's popularity soars though condemned by the @entity5 , the @entity8 leader was at the height of his popularity hours after the annexation
crowds gathered at the capital to sing and dance
" @entity7 , @entity7 , we love you ! " one woman said
" we bow to you
" to some @entity8 , it symbolized a defeat against the @entity5 .
