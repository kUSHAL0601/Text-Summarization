@entity0 , @entity1 -- diplomatic wheels turned tuesday as much of the international community prepared to welcome -- and help support -- a new government in @entity1
" the @entity8 is committed to assist a @entity1 - led , accountable and inclusive governance process , in a spirit of non-violence and upholding the key principles of democracy , the rule of law and human rights , thereby creating a conducive environment for free and fair elections , " @entity8 spokesman @entity7 told reporters in @entity10
secretary - general ban ki - moon sent a senior adviser , @entity21 , to @entity0 , where he met with senior officials and pledged the world body 's commitment
in @entity27 , @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 said @entity26 officials were " deeply engaged in trying to help this extraordinary transition that is taking place in @entity1
" in a joint news conference with @entity33 foreign secretary @entity32 , @entity25 said @entity1 's alliances should not necessarily determine what happens to its people
" it is not a @entity38 or the @entity26 or other choices , " he said
" this is about people of @entity1 and @entity1 making their choice about their future
and we want to work with @entity38 , with other countries , with everybody available to make sure this is peaceful from this day forward
" their comments came as acting president @entity50 told parliament tuesday that an interim unity government in @entity1 would be appointed thursday , raising the specter of continued instability here in the wake of the ouster of president @entity57
at the same session , parliament voted to ask the @entity59 in the @entity60 to investigate the " illegal actions of the main members of the government " -- including @entity57
but the @entity59 public affairs unit said in an e-mail that it had received no communication regarding @entity1 and that the @entity59 has no jurisdiction over that country , because it is not a state party to the @entity70 , the court 's founding treaty
in addition , it said , a state can not ask the @entity59 to investigate specific individuals
in the parliamentary session tuesday , lawmakers also voted to hold mayoral and city council elections on may 25 , concurrent with presidential elections
one candidate has already been announced
opposition leader and former heavyweight boxing champion @entity82 will run for the presidency , his press secretary @entity80 told @entity2
a dramatic sequence of political upheaval has unfolded in @entity1 in recent days after months of anti-government protests
last week , bloody street clashes between demonstrators and security forces left more than 80 dead , the deadliest violence in the country since it gained independence when the @entity93 collapsed 22 years ago
the violence continued tuesday , when an ex-presidential aide , @entity96 , was hospitalized after being shot in the leg , his press secretary , @entity94 , told @entity2
amid the unrest , the @entity26 has sent a team of @entity101 to the @entity102 in @entity0 to beef up security , an @entity26 official said
the request was made by the @entity105 and approved by the @entity106
last week , parliament ousted @entity57 , the focus of protesters ' anger , and authorities issued a warrant for his arrest over civilian deaths
but his whereabouts were unknown
lawmakers appointed @entity50 to serve as acting president and fired several of @entity57 's ministers
on monday , parliament named a new chief prosecutor , security service chief and central bank head
those now in power in the capital face a raft of challenges : the division between the country 's east and west ; protesters eager for bigger changes in government ; an economy riddled with corruption ; and how to handle the intentions of @entity38 , a vital supplier of natural gas and a key backer of @entity57
' we were trapped ' : eyewitness to massacre in @entity0 leadership change the head of @entity1 's electoral commission , @entity144 , said the campaign to elect a new president would begin tuesday , three months before the may 25 election date set by authorities
but @entity38 's @entity150 criticized those elections monday , saying @entity1 's parliament was acting rashly , and accused lawmakers of discriminating against ethnic @entity38 , most of whom live in the eastern part of the country -- near the border with @entity38 -- by excluding them from the reform process
" a course has been set for suppressing those who disagree in different regions of @entity1 with methods of dictatorship and terror , " the @entity150 said
@entity38 -- which pried @entity1 away from the @entity166 with a $ 15 billion loan in november -- has withdrawn that offer , and president @entity170 's role in the formation of a new government was uncertain
@entity38 contends that @entity57 was driven out by an " armed mutiny " of extremists and terrorists
" we have not only the internal enemies , but we have the external enemies , like @entity38 , " member of parliament @entity179 told @entity2 's @entity180 on tuesday from @entity0
" we are afraid of military intervention , and @entity170 is trying to find a pretext for that
" @entity38 's foreign minister has vowed not to intervene militarily , but tension is high between pro-russian and pro-european @entity1
clashes have broken out in the @entity189 on the @entity190
orobets said one of @entity1 's biggest challenges is getting its financial house in order
" we have to make unpopular steps , and we have to have this government taking those steps , " @entity179 said
" not just to have financial aid , but to have the plan of reforms to get outside of this economic crisis
" " this is not just the issue of @entity1
this is the issue of the whole region 's stability
" winners and losers east - west divide @entity57 's decision to scrap a @entity166 trade deal in favor of one with @entity38 prompted the protests , which began in november
the country 's new leaders have said @entity0 's return to @entity218 integration will be a priority
but in doing so , they risk an end to the aid that the @entity222 had bestowed on @entity57
interim finance minister @entity223 proposed monday that an international donor conference be held within two weeks
@entity1 , he said , will need $ 35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015
@entity26 treasury secretary @entity227 spoke sunday with @entity228 , of former prime minister @entity230 's @entity229 , or @entity231 , party , and told him that once a transitional government has been established , an @entity234 - centered international aid package would have broad support , the @entity26 @entity102 in @entity0 said in a posting on its website
" secretary @entity227 expressed that the @entity26 , together with @entity218 and others in the international community , are ready to supplement an @entity234 program to cushion the impact of reforms on low - income @entity1 , " it said
" however , secretary @entity227 underscored the need to implement reforms that could be supported by an @entity234 program
" @entity38 foreign minister @entity248 tuesday warned the @entity26 and @entity166 against turning @entity1 against its neighbor
" the relationship is not always developing in constructive ways
we have confirmed our position of not intervening in @entity1 politics , " he said
" we hope all channels will be used to calm the situation in @entity1
" @entity248 said @entity38 was working with @entity166 officials in @entity259 , @entity260
" it is not a good position to impose to @entity1 that ' either you are with us or without us
' but we hope it will become our full partner in the near future , " he added
@entity269 president @entity268 appealed tuesday " to all our international partners , in particular @entity38 , to work constructively with us to guarantee a united @entity1 that can be a factor for stability in the @entity218 continent ; a @entity1 that will have good relations both with its western as with its eastern partners
" ' people want to be united ' @entity57 's base of support is in eastern @entity1 , where @entity38 culture and language predominate and where many people are suspicious of the @entity218 - leaning views of their counterparts in western @entity1 , who were at the heart of the protests against @entity57 that filled central @entity0 for months
@entity57 insisted in a televised address over the weekend that he was still the legitimate president
but many senior @entity1 officials appeared to be turning their backs on their former leader
@entity1 ambassador to the @entity8 @entity294 told @entity2 's @entity180 on monday that @entity57 and his government had " betrayed " the @entity1 people
but @entity294 said the country is not as divided as some observers suggest
" they do n't want any civil war ; people want to be united , " he said
the old guard @entity57 's ouster was followed by the release over the weekend of @entity230 , one of his most bitter political foes
she spent 2Â½ years in prison , most of it in a detention hospital
she met tuesday with @entity166 foreign policy chief @entity311 in @entity0
on monday , @entity312 spoke with @entity1 's three main opposition party leaders : @entity228 ; @entity82 of the @entity316 party ; and @entity317 , of the nationalist right - wing party @entity314 , or @entity319
@entity230 , 53 , a longtime opposition leader and ally of @entity50 , has hinted she may be interested in running for the presidency
she is considered a hero of the 2004 " @entity323 , " which successfully challenged the results of an election won by @entity57
but she is less well regarded for her performance as prime minister from 2007 to 2010 , when she was ousted after losing to @entity57 in elections
" she was a very corrupt leader , " said @entity329 , senior editor at @entity330
" she was part of the reason the ' @entity323 ' failed
" @entity230 was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with @entity38
@entity338 governments said the case against her was politically motivated
amid the changes now under way , those involved in the recent street protests have expressed a desire for a new , untainted generation of leaders to step forward
" a lot of people who made this revolution feel like this movement has created a lot of new leaders , a lot of young leaders -- that now it 's their turn , " @entity329 told " @entity355 " over the weekend
@entity2 's @entity356 reported from @entity0 , and @entity357 reported and wrote with @entity358 from @entity359
@entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 and @entity365 contributed to this report .
