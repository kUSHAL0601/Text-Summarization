as @entity5 journalist @entity4 was flying to freedom sunday after 400 days in jail , the man in charge of @entity3 was making a long speech lamenting his country 's many problems
president @entity11 touched on the desperate state of the economy , the deadly jihadist insurrection in @entity15 , the role of religion in politics and human rights
amid this litany of woes , the jailing of @entity4 , who is @entity21 , and two other @entity5 journalists in @entity3 had become an embarrassment for a government whose human rights record was already receiving plenty of adverse attention
in july , soon after their sentences were handed down to an international outcry , president @entity11 acknowledged the case had been a pr disaster for @entity3
he told local journalists the trial had been " very negative " for the country 's reputation
" i wished they had been deported immediately after their arrest instead of being put on trial , " he said
@entity4 was arrested at the end of 2013 along with @entity47 bureau chief @entity46 and producer @entity48
they were accused of disseminating " false information " and belonging to a " terrorist organization
" after a four - month trial , @entity52 and @entity46 received seven - year sentences ; @entity55 got 10 years
as of monday , @entity46 and @entity48 were still behind bars
the case against them was part of a heavy - handed campaign against anyone who had anything to do with members or supporters of the @entity65 , which was decreed a " terrorist organization " soon after @entity11 and the military seized power
that campaign was supported by almost hysterical media coverage of the " threat within
" human rights groups say thousands of @entity65 members are in jail awaiting trial ; nearly 200 more have been sentenced to death
throughout the proceedings against the @entity5 journalists , the @entity3 government -- from @entity11 downwards -- insisted it had no part in the judicial process
few observers took that at face value
many thought the trio were pawns in a confrontation between @entity11 and the emirate of @entity91 , which funds @entity5
the charges even suggested as much , accusing the trio of broadcasting scenes " through the @entity91 @entity5 channel to assist the [ @entity65 ] terrorist group in achieving its purposes of influencing international public opinion
" @entity21 foreign minister @entity99 also alluded to the political complexion of the case when the three men were sentenced , saying : " @entity5 is not the favorite news channel in @entity3
so my fear is that @entity4 was in the wrong place at the wrong time
" throughout the @entity107 --- from @entity108 to @entity109 to @entity110 -- @entity91 has funded and supported groups affiliated with the @entity65 since the @entity112 erupted four years ago
among @entity91 's allies was the leader of @entity3 's @entity65 , @entity115 , who became president in june 2012 but was ousted by @entity11 a year later
@entity3 's traditional allies were openly appalled by the sentences against the three
the @entity121 lambasted " the prosecution of journalists for reporting information that does not coincide with the government of @entity3 's narrative
" but the journalists ' trial ( several others were charged in absentia ) was part of a pattern
@entity133 said the prosecution " coming after the prosecution of protesters and academics , shows how fast the space for dissent in @entity3 is evaporating
" one of many examples : @entity141 , an academic and former member of parliament , was charged with " insulting the judiciary after a tweet claiming the conviction of 43 employees of pro-democracy organizations demonstrated the " politicization " of the judiciary
he is yet to be tried
it was a draconian campaign that seemed tone - deaf toward governments that had long enjoyed good relations with @entity3 , and which -- in the case of the @entity154 -- provided billions in military aid
and as harrowing as the experience of the three @entity5 journalists has been , others have suffered worse fates , according to human rights groups
after @entity11 was elected president , @entity133 urged him to investigate " the police and army killings of more than 1,400 demonstrators over the past 12 months and the mounting allegations of torture and other ill - treatment of detainees
" @entity3 officials might argue that the @entity5 case was one component of a broader strategy to get @entity91 to mend its ways -- and that it worked
in the wake of the military takeover in @entity3 , @entity91 had become a sanctuary for @entity65 leaders
but in recent months , the @entity91 have quietly distanced themselves from prominent @entity65 figures
several left @entity91 in september , although the @entity91 insisted they had not been expelled
weeks later , @entity11 issued a decree allowing @entity3 to repatriate foreign prisoners , which is exactly what has happened to @entity52
@entity46 holds both @entity183 and @entity3 citizenship , so the same procedure seems likely in his case , but @entity48 is @entity3 and his fate remains unclear
which brings us back the speech @entity11 was making sunday as @entity4 was being deported
it came two days after the jihadist group @entity191 -- an affiliate of the @entity193 in @entity194 and @entity108 ( @entity195 ) -- carried out its most audacious attack yet on security outposts in the @entity15 desert , killing at least 30 people
acknowledging the threat from @entity202 militancy , @entity11 spoke of a " dangerous mass that has for the past 30 to 40 years been spreading extremist thought and does n't want to understand that @entity205 had created us different " ( code for the @entity65
) @entity11 announced that " east of the [ @entity209 ] @entity208 is now a single military command under the leadership of general @entity212 to fight terrorism
" but it 's the second time in four months he has promised the @entity3 people that he will combat extremism in @entity15
he also addressed the shooting death in @entity218 last week of political activist @entity219 , while casting himself as father of the nation
" @entity219 was the daughter of @entity3 and all the daughters and sons of @entity3 are my children , " @entity11 said , promising an investigation
activists claim @entity219 was shot by police during protests to mark the fourth anniversary of the 2011 uprising , in which more than 20 people were killed
anti-government protests have become more frequent despite the best efforts of the security forces
on the parlous state of the @entity3 economy and its public finances , @entity11 was equally forthright , thanking @entity237 and the @entity238 for their financial support , estimated at $ 11 billion in the year to july 2014
" if it was not for your support , @entity3 would not have survived until now , " he said
but he also admitted the government was still strapped for cash
" @entity3 does not have 150 billion @entity3 pounds ( about $ 20 billion ) to spend on its people
" simply put , amid this dire outlook , the @entity5 case became an irritant that @entity11 's government could do without
as president @entity11 himself made clear , the war on the @entity65 will continue to be pursued remorselessly
but his opponents at home and many international observers see a broader and unremitting campaign against dissent of any sort
@entity0 's @entity258 contributed to this report .
