the video captured from inside the @entity45 ' vehicle is being examined for clues , @entity20 said
despite the initial lack of physical evidence of a fire before the crash , " nothing is ruled out yet , " @entity20 told reporters at a news conference sunday
the @entity1 team is looking at the @entity5 driver 's last 72 hours to determine whether he had enough rest and whether he was using his cell phone when he lost control of his truck , @entity20 said
" fatigue , distraction and other human performance issues are at the top of our list
" dash - camera video from the first @entity68 vehicle on the scene could also help investigators understand what happened in the minutes after the crash as both vehicles burned , he said
investigators are interested in knowing whether passengers on the bus , which was new , were wearing seat belts , @entity20 said
some bus passengers were ejected from the vehicle , including the ones who died , he said

investigators found 175 feet of tire marks left by the bus , indicating the driver tried to avoid crashing into the truck
a computer on the truck that could have revealed how fast the truck was traveling -- known a the electrical control module -- was destroyed by fire , he said
the electrical control module on the bus survived but has not yet been examined , he said
blood samples should be obtained from the bodies of both drivers , which will provide information about whether drugs or alcohol might have been in their systems , he said
