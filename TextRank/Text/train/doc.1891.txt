-- dear @entity1 , @entity2 is here
i know you will once again be wondering why @entity5 does n't come home from work
i know this makes you sad
it makes me sad , too
i want to see you
i want to help you dress , brush your teeth and drive you to school
i want to take you outside so we can tend to your garden of tomatoes and peppers or ride your bicycle
since the last time we were together , i am sure you have gotten better at applying the brakes
i bet next time i see you i wo n't have to keep yelling " pedal backwards ! pedal backwards ! " i am writing this letter to explain to you why my work takes me away from home for so long
you may not understand everything i 'm saying now , but i hope one day you will
i work in @entity26 in @entity27
this country looks like heaven , but for too many people here , it feels like hell
there is stunning natural beauty , but it seems like so many of its 77 million people are simply trying to survive
their daily life is defined by extreme poverty , sickness and constant fear of marauding militias of men who roam the country molesting women and kids with impunity
@entity1 , my job is to try to make life better for mommies and kids
women in @entity26 , as they do in so many countries , work farm fields , bring home firewood , fetch heavy buckets of water , cook for the entire family and take care of all the children
even though women do that work , they earn very little money and are often treated very badly
men receive the money earned by women
men decide how it is spent
much of the time , men do n't even listen to what women and girls have to say about how the family money is spent
women are excluded from many of the family 's most important decisions -- even decisions that directly affect their own lives
i try to help women and girls in @entity26 go to school , visit the doctor and earn money so they can take care of themselves and their families
i got into this line of work because when i look back on my own childhood in northern @entity90 , i realize that i could 've easily been one of those people that organizations like @entity93 are trying to help
to help women and girls , i spend much of my time speaking with and educating men
just as men here have the power to make life very difficult for girls and women , they also have the power to support the girls and women around them
we are most successful helping daughters and mothers when sons and fathers are working alongside us
we talk to husbands about the community - wide benefits of supporting girls ' education and their wives ' efforts to save money and start small businesses
we show men how violence undermines the families and communities they value
i like to remind men that the women they can help lift from misery and despair are their mothers , aunties , daughters and sisters
i also tell them that being a responsible man requires being respectful of everyone
manhood is not about physical strength or the power to bully others
rather , it is working to make society better for everyone , including women and girls
that is a lesson still being learned not only here in the @entity26 but also there in the @entity143 and the rest of the world
when you grow up to be a man , @entity1 , you will have a right to be free and make decisions for yourself
but you should not take rights away from girls or women
robbing a girl or women of her rights is like robbing yourself
when a man takes away a girl 's right to go to school , he is taking away a girl 's right to do what she wants when she grows up -- her right to be a doctor , engineer , pilot , teacher , nurse or university professor
he is robbing his community of her talent and contributions
work for the freedom of others , @entity1
@entity178 is like a boomerang
what you throw into the world comes back to you
i 'm sorry i wo n't be home for @entity2 or to open the card you made for me at school
but i 'm proud to be part of a movement of men working with women around the world to make sure everyone -- regardless of gender -- is treated with dignity and respect
i may not come home in a uniform , but please know that our family 's sacrifice is for the most important struggle of our time
i know it makes you sad today , but i hope one day it inspires you to help others
i am so looking forward to spending future @entity207 with you
and watching as you grow into a good man
