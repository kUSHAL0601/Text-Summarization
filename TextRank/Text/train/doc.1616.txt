-- the contrast could not be greater
as @entity5 hooked his tee shot at the first hole way left of the fairway , new world number one @entity2 rolled home a birdie putt on his closing hole to lead the @entity11 on nine - under - par. woods , who bravely teed it up in the final major of the season despite a back problem , was eventually finish with a second straight 74 to be five shots outside the halfway cut mark for the weekend
@entity2 , bidding for a hat - trick of victories after winning the @entity19 and @entity20 , followed his opening 66 with a 67 to set a testing target for the later starters , which nobody was able to match
@entity27 of @entity28 got closest with a best of the day 65 to trail @entity2 by a stroke and he was joined on eight under by veteran @entity32 @entity31
as one of the early starters on the second day , the 25 - year - old @entity33 had to battle torrential rain , which brought about a near hour delay to play at @entity38 , but carded just a solitary bogey on his card
starting from the 10th , it came on the 12th to put him back to four - under , but @entity2 rebounded superbly with a birdie at the next and then an eagle on the par - five 18th , rolling home a 30 - foot putt
a run of pars came on the first six holes of his back nine before a stunning 242 - yard five - wood approach to the par - five seventh had the galleries gasping
@entity2 missed his putt for a second eagle of his round but the tap in birdie took him to eight - under and on his final hole , the ninth , came that final birdie to open up a lead on the field
" i 'm feeling good about my game
i 'm confident , " @entity2 said
" i did n't hit it quite as well as i did yesterday , but still really in control of my game and my emotions , " he told the official @entity65 website
@entity70 's @entity69 and @entity32 @entity71 , both leading on six - under after 65s on thursday , carded respective second rounds of 72 and 74 to drop back into the pack in @entity76
woods did save par on the first after his errant tee shot , but left himself with an almost insurmountable task to make the weekend after a three - putt double bogey on the sixth
he appeared to be hampered by his injury , but the 38 - year - old did finish with a flourish by birdieing the 18th
@entity88 , who had been paired with @entity77 , went one better , rolling home a short eagle putt to signal his challenge after a 67 for six - under overall
the 2013 @entity19 champion has only one top - 10 finish all season , but moved to within three shots of leader @entity2 with his late charge .
