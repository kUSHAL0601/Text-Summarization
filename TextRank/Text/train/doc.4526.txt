-- a grand jury has indicted a northern @entity4 couple accused of holding @entity5 captive for nearly two decades , authorities said friday
@entity6 and @entity5 face 18 counts , including kidnapping , rape and false imprisonment
they are also accused of possessing child pornography
both had previously pleaded not guilty to 29 felony counts in the case
@entity16 was 11 years old when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her home in @entity21 , @entity4
authorities say the @entity23 held @entity16 in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years
she was 29 when she was found in august 2009 at the @entity27 ' home in @entity28 , about 120 miles from her house
@entity5 's lawyers on friday entered a plea of not guilty on her behalf to the revised charges
proceedings against her husband have been suspended to determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial
the indictment , filed september 21 in @entity37 , allows the prosecution to circumvent a preliminary hearing , at which @entity16 might have testified in open court
the next hearing in the case is scheduled for november 4
the indictment came to light during a scheduled hearing friday , at which the @entity23 were present
they sat just a few chairs apart and showed little emotion as they spoke to their lawyers and listened to the judge
" there 's a number of reasons why we might use a grand jury , " @entity53 district attorney @entity52 later told reporters outside the courthouse
" one obvious reason is that sometimes given the publicity in a case , it 's a better way to get the case to a final conclusion and move it along to trial
" @entity67 , @entity5 's attorney , said he did not imagine a trial would start before the end of next year
he also said he believed that @entity16 testified before the grand jury
@entity71 , a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest , is accused of fathering two daughters with @entity16 during her captivity
@entity16 now lives in seclusion with her mother , @entity79 , and @entity16 's two daughters
officials have said @entity16 does not want to speak to @entity71 or his attorneys , and authorities have tried to keep her location a secret .
