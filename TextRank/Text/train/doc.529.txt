it 's an idea that 's radical in its simplicity
@entity3 voters on november 24 will consider capping executive pay at 12 times what the lowest - paid worker at a company makes -- the premise being that a ceo should make no more in a month than a low - level employee earns in a year
the referendum , which is called the " 1:12 initiative " and began after supporters gathered 100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot , is the kind of elegant solution to income inequality that we in the @entity22 should consider more seriously
not because the initiative , as it will be voted on , would work in the @entity22
but because the idea of tethering top executive pay to some sort of concrete metric might stop @entity22 execs from floating further into the stratosphere
related : the most unequal place in @entity22 here in @entity22 , the land of unequal opportunity , the @entity32 of top - 500 companies make in a single day about what it takes an average " rank - and - file " worker a year to earn , according to the @entity39 , the federation of unions
@entity3 has an average ceo - to - worker compensation ratio of 148 to 1 , the group says
the average @entity22 rate is 354 to 1 , according to the @entity39
others put the ratio somewhat lower , around 273 to 1 in 2012
either way , it 's bad
and some @entity22 companies are worse , still
@entity49 has the highest ratio -- 1,795:1 -- on a list of 250 businesses compiled by @entity53
that department store 's ceo got $ 53.3 million in pay and benefits in 2012 , @entity53 says
workers , by comparison , earned only about $ 30,000 a year
so , like , whatever , right ? what 's @entity61 up to ? it 's tempting to excuse sky - high exec pay as either necessary ( to attract top " talent " and because these inequality - era celebs are thought to increase the value of the companies where they exercise said talents ) or inconsequential
the @entity3 vote , for example , does nothing to increase average worker pay
it aims solely to clip cash from the very top of the economic ladder
but the pay ratio does matter , for a couple of common - sense reasons
one is that democracy starts to unravel if a few people become wildly , ethereally successful , while the rest of a country struggles
that was the best argument i heard on a recent phone call with @entity88 , a @entity3 politician who has been one of the earliest proponents of the 1:12 initiative
@entity88 is not arguing for the enforced pay ratio on practical or economic grounds
his is a moral position -- that it is fundamentally unfair for the pay gap to be so wide , and that it allows a few uber - rich people to wield undo influence over society , economics and politics
" there is a certain threat to democracy , " he told me
related : is income inequality ' morally wrong ' ? @entity88 does n't expect the 1:12 initiative to pass , but it does have about 35 % to 40 % support in recent polls , he told me , which is fairly staggering , and indicates people are fed up
another argument against sky - high ceo pay is that it 's unnecessary
@entity117 , a distinguished professor of corporate and business law at @entity119 , told me ceo pay has been rising for decades and that the @entity22 is , in effect , subsidizing the trend with " unlimited tax deductions " on certain forms of pay
" i 'm a big fan of capitalism , " she said
" i love corporations and i love the business world and i think it 's done more for peace and prosperity than people may realize
but there are structural reasons to think that executive pay and ceo pay are out of whack
" a $ 1 million salary worked for @entity22 ceos from the 1930s to 1980s , she said
ceo pay , including options realized that year , jumped about 875 % , to $ 14.1 million , from 1978 to 2012 , according to the @entity141
that increase , which is calcuated using 2012 dollars , according to @entity141 , is " more than double stock market growth and substantially greater than the painfully slow 5.4 % growth in a typical worker 's compensation over the same period
" a 5 % increase at the bottom versus 875 % at the top
that 's the same , right ? " what we 've got is basically an arms race , " @entity117 said , " where the @entity32 are competing on pay because they each want to have higher status than the others
" related : should we vilify the rich ? finally , all of this is bad business
@entity161 , who is recognized as the father of business management , famously said the ceo - to - worker salary ratio should not exceed 20:1 , which is what existed in the @entity22 in 1965 , according to the @entity141
beyond that , managers will see an increase in " resentment and falling morale , " @entity161 once wrote , according to a blog post by @entity172
that resentment is behind both the @entity174 and the @entity3 vote
so the question to me is not if we should do something about outlandish executive pay , but what , exactly
the 1:12 ratio would be unlikely to gain any traction in the @entity22 , said @entity184 , principal at @entity185 , a company that does consulting on executive pay issues
he called the measure , which , according to @entity88 , includes stock options and other non-salary forms of pay , " potentially draconian " and said most ratios between ceo and worker pay he hears discussed deal with three - digit numbers
twelve is a shock , i 'll agree , and it 's probably too extreme for the @entity22
it 's clear , however , that the ways @entity22 has been trying to curb executive pay are not working -- perhaps because they 're too convoluted and lack teeth
shareholders get to vote on executive pay in the @entity22 , for example , but their decisions are n't binding
loopholes let @entity32 dodge taxes on their income
and the @entity210 currently is asking for public comment on a proposal that would require companies to disclose the ratio of their ceo 's pay to the median income of workers
( tell them what you think of that here )
but , according to some news reports , the metrics are so loosey - goosey it will be difficult to compare one company to another
that 's still just a disclosure
maybe we need an enforceable ratio
the best idea i 've heard comes from @entity117 , the @entity119 professor
she has suggested making ceo pay non-deductible when it 's higher than 100 times the minimum wage
i might take it one step further : perhaps the @entity22 should cap ceo pay at 100 times the minimum wage , combining @entity117 's idea with the @entity3 proposal
it 's just an idea , and it should be vetted by economists and the public
but , to me , that 's the point
these are concepts that should be on the table in the @entity22
it 's ridiculous that @entity210 attempts to make ceo pay ratios transparent are controversial in the business community
the conversation needs to move forward
limiting ceo pay to 100 times the minimum wage would still allow top execs to be millionaires -- they 'd earn a maximum wage of about $ 1.5 million per year , given the current federal minimum of $ 7.25 an hour , figured for a 40 - hour work week
and here 's the best part : if the fat cats wanted a pay increase , maybe the best way for them to get it would be to throw political weight behind a campaign to boost the minimum wage
that 's a reform simple enough to make a difference .
