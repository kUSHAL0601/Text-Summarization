@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 's failure to protect star quarterback @entity4 proved the decisive factor as the @entity6 flunked their chance of a perfect 19 - 0 season and @entity10 glory
@entity4 is sacked by defensive end @entity11 in the third guarter of the @entity10
@entity4 has weaved his magic behind an all but impregnable offensive line all season but not on sunday as he was sacked five times in the 17 - 14 defeat to the @entity19
" they have some great pressure schemes , obviously some great pass rushers , " @entity4 said
" once we kind of got the idea of what we were doing , i thought we handled it much better , but we did n't get the ball in the end zone enough
" coming in , @entity4 had been sacked a career - low 24 times this season playing behind a line that produced three @entity32 in @entity33 , left tackle @entity34 and left guard @entity35
throw in right guard @entity36 and right tackle @entity37 , and @entity4 played most of his record - breaking season not having to worry much about getting hit by bloodthirsty defenders
" i like when i do n't get touched , " @entity4 said earlier in the week
then , disaster struck -- in the form of an all - out , pressure - packed swarming defensive attack by the @entity19 -- in the worst possible setting
it was the first time @entity4 had been sacked as many as five times since the @entity46 did it on sept. 21 , 2003
@entity3 had no answer for the @entity19 ' bulldozing defense
" if i could tell you , we 'd have it fixed , " running back @entity53 said
" at the same time , they outplayed us
" they sure did , and left @entity4 wondering what hit him
@entity4 simply had no time to find @entity57 and his other targets on a regular basis against the @entity19
with 19 seconds left in the game and the @entity6 facing a do - or - die scenario , @entity4 was sacked for the final time when @entity63 pulled him down at @entity3 's 16 - yard line
@entity4 was left with nothing to do but try two straight desperation heaves to @entity57 to no avail
" i think their intensity from the beginning snap to the end of the game was really higher than ours , " @entity57 said
" we just could n't meet that intensity
" with help from their linemen , the @entity6 set @entity78 records for points scored and total touchdowns , while @entity4 broke the league mark for @entity82 passes and @entity57 set the record for scoring receptions
that high - powered offense was held to a season - low 14 points in the @entity10 -- mostly because it could n't get time
" they played well defensively , " coach @entity87 said
" they 've been able to rush
they led the league in sacks , they rushed all year
they are a good defensive football team
" " we all could 've done things better tonight , " @entity4 said
