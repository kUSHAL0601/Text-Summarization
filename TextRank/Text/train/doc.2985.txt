-- seven - time formula one world champion @entity1 insists he is still motivated to race in @entity3 despite last week 's announcement that he will be replaced at @entity5 by @entity6
the @entity7 has been linked with a switch to the @entity10 team after it was confirmed @entity12 @entity11 would be leaving the @entity14 - based marque to replace 2008 world champion @entity6 at @entity16
" my motivation is completely intact after the news last week , " the 43 - year - old told the sport 's official website ahead of this weekend 's @entity21 @entity20
" especially because @entity24 is one of the season 's highlights for me
i enjoy the circuit -- it has sections that challenge you as a driver like almost nowhere else
" @entity6 joins @entity5 in three - year deal since coming out of retirement in 2010 , the former @entity34 driver has struggled to recapture his best form
he won five consecutive titles with the @entity39 team between 2000 and 2004 , but he has registered just one podium finish since returning to the sport
on sunday , the most - decorated driver in @entity3 history will have his work cut out to finish in the points as @entity1 must serve a 10 - place grid penalty at @entity24 for his part in a collision which forced both he and @entity50 's @entity49 out of the @entity51
" logically , it would also be nice to achieve a sporting highlight this weekend , " continued @entity1
" although my chances are of course very limited because of my grid penalty
but i 've always approached these things as a challenge
" @entity1 is currently 12th in the drivers ' standings , 151 points behind championship leader @entity62 of @entity34 , with six races of the season remaining .
