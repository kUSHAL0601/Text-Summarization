-- three and a half weeks since having a double mastectomy , @entity1 says she 's " doing better than i anticipated in recovery
" while that 's great news for the @entity7 host , she also says her breast cancer ordeal has changed her life for the better " in so many ways
" " i never thought my marriage could be stronger , or i could be closer to [ my husband ] @entity15 , " she told people at an @entity7 luncheon on saturday for the @entity18 press tour in @entity19 , @entity20 she 's also become more religious
" we go to church every sunday
and we did before , but it never meant as much as it does now , " @entity1 , 37 , says
" we prayed on our own , but now we prayed together and you 'll never know how much that means until you do it
@entity15 and i have changed our lives in that one way
" as for the decision to have the surgery , which removed both her breasts , she has no regrets
" the surgery brought my risks down to 95 to 100 percent , " she said
" if i had a lumpectomy , i would have early estrogen menopause for at least two years , and i want to have children
" besides , she told people , her breasts do n't define who she is as a person or as a professional in the entertainment industry
" i did n't give two sh * * s about my breasts
i did n't care that at the @entity49 , i would n't be able to show cleavage , " she said
" a lot of people were shocked
they said , ' are you sure you want to do this ? think about the life you lead and the fabulous dresses and that 's part of your job
it could put your job in jeopardy
' and i thought , if i ever have a job that is defined by my breasts and some gorgeous gown then i 'm in the wrong business
" it also helps that her husband has been by her side throughout her health scare
" it breaks my heart that a lot of women do n't have a supportive husband , " she said
