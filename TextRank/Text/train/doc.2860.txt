@entity1 the lawyer for the 19 - year - old man accused of killing a @entity1 woman -- allegedly after a road rage incident -- says his client feared for his life
@entity8 made his first court appearance monday , a brief initial hearing inside a packed @entity12 courtroom in which he did not enter a plea
his lawyer , @entity15 , says he will argue self - defense
he questions the version of events given by police and the victim 's family and claims police interviewed @entity8 while he was high on marijuana
in fact , the lawyer claims @entity8 asked police if he could get high during the standoff that ended in his arrest , and that police agreed
but @entity12 district attorney @entity28 , interviewed tuesday night on @entity29 , said he does n't think self - defense is a factor in the shooting
" i do n't see that in this case , " he said
@entity28 said authorities are looking for the person who was driving the car in which @entity8 was riding , and possibly a third person who was in the car
" this was a drive - by shooting
he shot out of a moving vehicle , " @entity28 said
" the driver has certain culpability
" @entity8 is charged with murder , attempted murder , assault and firing a gun from a car in the february 12 death of @entity51 , 44
police say @entity8 shot @entity53 in front of her home after a confrontation while driving
the victim and the suspect knew each other -- a fact the family knew but police say they only found out the day of the arrest
according to police , the incident began when @entity53 was giving her daughter a driving lesson at a school parking lot when " a silver four door car sped up behind them and pulled along the driver 's side of the car
" after the daughter honked the horn , the other car raced ahead and blocked their path , and a man got out of the car threatening them
@entity53 later went looking for the car with her 22 - year - old son , who was armed with a 9 mm pistol , according to police
after finding the car , they began following it
the driver stopped , and the passenger began firing at the @entity89 , according to police
@entity53 drove home , but the other car followed and the occupant opened fire on them in front of their house , according to police
@entity53 was struck in the head and died two days later
@entity15 said @entity53 ' son pointed a gun at @entity100 before anyone started shooting
he said his client received death threats , but he did not elaborate
road rage suspect knew victim , husband says the lawyer questions whether the alleged road rage incident between @entity53 and @entity8 occurred and has doubts about the family 's account of what happened
" there was no road rage , " @entity15 said
he said accounts of @entity8 's reported discussions of the shootings with friends do n't appear to be consistent with the road rage claim
he also questioned the family 's initial description of the shooting suspect
@entity125 ' daughter described the driver who threatened them as being 6 feet tall
" there are serious inconsistencies and problems with their story and i have serious concerns , " @entity15 told @entity2
a preliminary hearing was set for march 10 , during which investigators will reveal more of the evidence and a judge will determine whether the case should go forward
however , the district attorney has issued a notice that his office may go to a grand jury instead of a preliminary hearing
the defense says such a move would indicate something weak about the prosecutors ' case
@entity12 district attorney @entity28 told reporters after the hearing that prosecutors are sure of their case against @entity8
" it is not a straightforward case , " he said
" it is not a garden variety , run - of - the - mill case
we all know there are certain nuances to this case
but at the end of the day , this young man is charged with a senseless , stupid act of murder and we intend to prove it in court
" @entity168 's husband , @entity53 , also attended the hearing
" i 'll be here every court date , " he told reporters
@entity172 and @entity173 reported from @entity1
@entity174 reported and wrote from @entity175
@entity2 's @entity176 also contributed to this report .
