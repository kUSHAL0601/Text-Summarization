@entity0 -- the @entity3 government moved friday to resolve a crisis that erupted earlier in the day when the country 's top four military officers left their jobs en masse in the latest power play between the government and the @entity3 military
late at night , the government turned to the only top commander who has not quit his position , naming former @entity17 commander general @entity16 acting chief of general staff and land force commander
according to people familiar with @entity3 's procedures , he needs to serve at least for a day as a force commander before he can be appointed to the top military position of chief of general staff
the announcement came hours after chief of staff gen. @entity27 tendered his retirement letter to the prime minister , the country 's state - run @entity24 reported
land forces commander gen. @entity31 , @entity33 commander adm. @entity32 and air forces commander gen. @entity34 , all asked for their retirement
their departures came in the face of disagreements by the military with the government over the fate of officers jailed for allegedly plotting to overthrow the ruling @entity43
and they come at a key time -- three days before monday 's planned meeting of @entity3 's @entity47 , which will decide what happens to the officers , state - run media reported friday
the government wants active - duty officers who are defendants in the case to retire
the military says the officers , some of whom are up for promotions , have not been proven guilty and therefore should not be forced to leave
@entity27 had met earlier friday with president @entity60 and prime minister @entity61 , who won his third term in office last june in a landslide victory , a show of political power that has energized his base of support
about 200 soldiers , including senior ones , both retired and active - duty , are defendants in an ongoing court case about an alleged coup plan dubbed " @entity77 " said to have been cooked up eight years ago at a meeting of military officers
" it 's unprecedented to have the chief of staff and three force commanders resigning en masse , " said @entity78 , director and senior associate of the @entity80
" it 's an expression of displeasure with the civilian government and , frankly , leaves in disarray the promotion process that was about to begin , " he said
" this is their clearest possible response to prime minister @entity61
" he said it comes at an important time , with the @entity3 military fighting the @entity96 in the southeast , and predicted the moves will create massive complications among the land forces
@entity78 said the military establishment , according to its traditions , puts forth its own promotion recommendations , with the participation of the prime minister and the defense minister
once they reach an agreement , the list is sent to the president for approval
but there have been tensions between the country 's military , which has supported the secular system over the years , and @entity61 's party , which has @entity121 roots
accusations by @entity61 's government that military and secular figures were involved in coup plots have intensified hostilities
the government wants to prevent these officers from getting promoted and holding key positions in the military while the military does not want them to be forced to retire
@entity133 , director of the @entity3 research program at the @entity135 and a visiting professor at @entity137 , wrote in an article for @entity1 's @entity139 on friday that the military " is snapping under the weight of the ruling @entity43 , " known as the @entity43
" historically the most - respected institution in the country and the kingmaker in @entity145 , the military has seen its prestige and power free - fall since the @entity43 took power in 2002 , " @entity133 wrote
" coup allegations , including assertions that the military was planning to bomb @entity0 's historic mosques to precipitate a political crisis , have hurt the @entity3 army 's standing
the military 's status as the most trusted institution in the country is plummeting : in 2002 , around 90 percent of the @entity3 said they trusted their military , while now most polls show that barely 60 percent say they do
" he mentions another court case , known as @entity163 , which also accuses the military of involvement in a coup plot : " for the first time in its life , the @entity3 military is like a deer in headlights , facing the political high beams of the @entity163 case
" " and now the military has snapped
the straw that broke the camel 's back came earlier this week , when pro-akp media suggested that 14 active - duty generals and admirals who had been arrested in relationship to the @entity163 case , though not yet indicted , would not only be bypassed in their promotions , but also forced to resign
furthermore , only yesterday , the police arrested 22 additional top brass officers , blocking their likely promotion
" he said the " officer corps is demoralized , " with generals and hundreds of other officers jailed with no indictments in sight
" this is the @entity3 military leadership 's way of telling the government : ' we are done playing with you
set up your own team -- if you can , " he said
@entity200 reported from @entity201 .
