-- " what do you call a @entity4 driver with a speeding ticket ? a liar
" @entity7 might not have heard that old joke about the much - maligned car , an icon of the @entity12 era , but it might give him a chuckle
" i had a @entity21 lada , " the @entity15 star revealed as he took @entity0 's @entity16 for a spin in a flashy sports car provided by his team @entity19
" i got it from a friend of ours
it was perfect for us -- free of charge and a very robust car
" it was red but we painted it black
" the @entity33 now drives one of the world 's fastest vehicles on the @entity15 racetrack -- which he definitely would n't be allowed to paint black -- but the down - to - earth approach of his first car beautifully sums up his underlying normality
the man they call the " @entity7 " is @entity15 's most reluctant star
the 34 - year - old is known for his succinct , cool answers when facing the media
and while he does n't say much , he often says what he thinks
perhaps his most famous admission came in 2006 when he explained he missed the presentation for the retiring @entity49 , the man he was going to replace at @entity19 the following year , because he was in the bathroom -- or words to that effect
then there are the off - track headlines , like the time he was filmed falling off a boat during a party
@entity7 's pithy comments and antics have made him a cult icon among @entity15 fans but he insists he would rather stay out of the spotlight
" it 'd be perfect to lead a normal life where nobody notices you , " he tells @entity0
" but obviously you can not have both
" racing and driving is the main thing but there 's a lot of other stuff that comes with it
" i 've been long enough in the business to know that it 's a big part of it
for me , it 's not much fun
" i 'm not a big fan of going places and showing off , i 'd rather do my own things
i never try to hide it because it is how it is
" unlike many other drivers on the grid , @entity7 is also refreshingly honest about his childhood ambitions while growing up in the city of @entity90
" i would n't say i wanted to become a @entity15 driver straight away , " he explains
" i actually started out with motocross when i was a small boy and then go - karts
it was good fun and you start wanting more
" but i still did n't believe that i would even make it to @entity15 because we did n't have the money
" i just thought i 'd do karts for as long as possible and then do something else
" that something else was two titles in the @entity103
after just 23 races , @entity7 was signed up by @entity105 and fast - tracked into @entity15 for the 2001 season
he won his first grand prix with @entity108 in 2003 and his first and only world title with @entity19 in 2007 before the @entity111 team effectively paid up the rest of his salary to bring in @entity114 for the 2010 season
officially retired from @entity15 , @entity7 flexed his driving muscles in the @entity117 and got behind the wheel for two @entity120 races
his team radio in the @entity123 series endeared him to new fans with such quotable outbursts as : " i do n't understand how this car can be so hot
my ass is even burning in here
" " i really enjoy the whole @entity120 thing , " @entity7 recalls
" it 's just completely different and fun
it was a good experience
" hopefully i can do more ( races ) some day
i 've said i 'd like to do some more rallies in the future
" for now , @entity15 's reluctant star is focused on finishing his second spell in the sport with @entity19 , having returned to @entity137 after two seasons with @entity139 in which he re-established himself on the grid despite the team 's financial problems
with two wins and 15 podiums he became hot property , and replaced @entity146 at the home of the " @entity148
" the 34 - year - old , who has struggled with an under - performing car this season , says he plans to finish his career with the @entity111 marque but is giving nothing away on when exactly that might be
four - time world champion @entity156 is expected to sign for @entity19 next year , with @entity114 tipped to return to @entity108
" i have a contract for next year and probably for one more year , " @entity7 says
" but i 'm not a young guy anymore
" i want to do something more with my life than just @entity15
i will finish my career in @entity19
" i never lost the passion
i will stop the day when i feel i do n't enjoy it anymore
" a new chapter is about to begin for @entity7 in the near future when his girlfriend @entity166 gives birth to their first child
" the biggest challenge will be with a family , " he says
" that will take a lot of time and effort
" asked if he would encourage his child to follow him into motor racing , he gives a typically direct and definitive " no ! " @entity7 might not be keen on small talk but he is looking forward to discussing fatherhood with @entity156 , his closest friend in @entity15 , who became a father to a baby daughter earlier this year
" the guy i have most to do with outside of racing is @entity156 , " he says
" the rest i do n't really see as friends , i race against them
" he 's just a normal guy and it 's an easy relationship
" on the subject of sharing baby tips with the @entity190 , @entity7 adds : " yes , he has more experience ... " he might be one of @entity15 's most - enigmatic and best - loved stars , and still among the highest earners , but in many ways he has stayed true to his roots
" i have normal cars , " he explains
" maybe when i was young i was a bit more like , ' this nice car , i want to have this and drive this
i drive normal cars without people noticing me , so it makes my life easy
" dare we suggest , @entity7 might have rewound time by swapping a @entity19 for a beat - up @entity4 ?
