he is a 9 - year - old boy without a country
@entity2 is a @entity3 citizen , born in @entity4
the @entity8 , in an unusual exception , will not allow his family to list " @entity13 " as the nation of birth on his @entity3 passport
the @entity14 will decide whether granting this " small " gesture on behalf of a child half a world away -- and others like him -- would disrupt the @entity22 administration 's ongoing efforts to secure a binding , lasting peace settlement for the troubled region
oral arguments in the case are set for monday
at issue are two questions , one narrow , one broad : may courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the @entity8 how to record the birthplace of an @entity3 citizen on a passport ? and does the law impermissibly infringe on the president 's power to recognize a foreign sovereign ? " there have been 50,000 americans in the last 10 years that were born in @entity4 , and many of them would like to have @entity13 indicated as their place of birth in the passports , " said @entity38 , a @entity39 professor , and until recently a counselor on international law at the @entity8
" but this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the @entity3
" the high court case is @entity2 v. @entity52 , but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world , and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence : @entity4
its name translates as " @entity62 " to some , " @entity63 " to others
it is @entity13 's largest city and its capital , though that is not recognized by the @entity69 and most of the world community
divided into @entity4 ( populated mostly by @entity72 ) and @entity73 ( populated mostly by @entity74 ) , the city spans over 48 square miles , with about 775,000 people
the terms " @entity77 " and " @entity73 " come layered with political , social , religious , and geographic questions -- amorphous , often misleading terms , symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents
some use the terms " @entity74 " or " @entity86 " @entity4 to refer to the sections
the @entity88 is the heart of the region , a holy symbol to the three major @entity93 religions -- @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96
that tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103
it is believed to have been first settled in the fourth millennium @entity105 , and according to the @entity108 , it was established as the capital of the @entity110 around 1000 @entity105 by @entity111
it has been destroyed twice , and attacked , besieged and captured more than a hundred times
canaanites , @entity115 , arabs , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , crusaders , @entity121 , and the @entity122 have all laid claim to the land
its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive @entity129 peace agreement
during the 1948 war , the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of @entity13 , and the eastern part annexed by @entity135
the eastern part was then captured by @entity13 during the 1967 @entity136
it considers @entity4 part of its " undivided capital , " but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of @entity145 land
the @entity13 government is based there , but no foreign embassies
the city is home to @entity150 and @entity151
the couple and their two oldest sons were born in the @entity3 , but the family migrated to @entity13 a decade ago , and in 2002 the youngest , @entity156 was born
" they 're both proud @entity3 citizens but feel a very strong affinity , religiously too , to the state of @entity13 , " said @entity157 , the @entity2 's @entity158 - based lawyer
" their son is very proud of the fact that he is the one sibling born in @entity13
" just three weeks before @entity2 was born , the @entity166 gave @entity3 citizens born in @entity4 the individual discretion to ask that @entity13 be listed on passports and consular reports , where it says " @entity171
" president @entity172 signed the bill , but issued an executive " signing statement " indicating he would not comply
the law , he said " impermissibly interferes with the president 's constitutional authority to conduct the nation 's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch
" it is not the first time the @entity166 and @entity183 have clashed over the region
the @entity3 embassy remains in @entity186 , over @entity3 lawmakers ' objections
the boy 's mother made the " @entity13 " request about two months after his birth , but embassy officials refused
his passport in fact shows his round , innocent face , and @entity4 " is listed as his place of birth
" that 's been the @entity8 's practice , the general rule for @entity3 citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth , " said @entity157
" so if a citizen is born for instance in @entity211 , it says @entity212
if they 're born in @entity186 or @entity215 , it says just @entity13
if you 're born in @entity4 , instead of saying the country , the city is listed -- just a city -- @entity4
" the attorneys for the @entity221 have framed their case as a modest request , one that does not implicate the president 's foreign policy power
they are asking the high court not to decide a political question , but simply tell the administration to enforce the law , for the sake of a little boy
" it is a very personal case
what 's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of @entity13 , and their right , given by @entity166 , to express that , on the passport , " said @entity243 , who will argue the family 's case before the high court
" that pride , and the national pride of others , is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is
but i do n't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity
@entity166 has recognized that it 's part of his self respect , that he should be able to say @entity13 , and that 's all that we 're asking for in this case
" the government is thinking of the bigger picture
@entity8 officials would not comment on the record on a pending case , but president @entity22 has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the @entity3
" palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state ; @entity13 should know that their basic security concerns will be met , " he said in a may 2010 speech
" i know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict
two wrenching and emotional issues remain : the future of @entity4 , and the fate of @entity145 refugees
but moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair , and that respects the rights and aspirations of @entity13 and @entity145
" the justices in accepting the @entity2 appeal specifically added a legal question not raised by the family 's lawyers : whether the congressional law steps on the president 's foreign policy power
" it 's one of those issues that people probably find remarkable that it has n't been addressed before , " @entity301 said
" because , presidents have been recognizing states and governments for 200 years
@entity166 generally has acquiesced in what the president has done
there has been very little conflict over the exercise of that power traditionally , other than in , for example , the @entity311 [ conflict with mainland @entity313 ] and , in particular , over @entity4
this is an issue that has been a festering source of tension between @entity166 and presidents for decades
" the family plans to attend the court session in @entity158 next week
choosing a home , and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right
but nothing is so easy when @entity4 is mentioned
the @entity221 say they recognize the geo - political complexity , but think in this case , in this judicial forum , the solution is simple
" everybody knows @entity4 is in @entity13
why is the @entity8 refusing to recognize this ? " said @entity243
" they have this is fear of nonexistent hobgoblins which has caused them to follow this policy , and it 's about time -- @entity166 thought it was about time -- they get rid of that policy ... all that we 're asking the @entity14 to do is agree with @entity166 , that this is a foolish policy , and ought to be eliminated
