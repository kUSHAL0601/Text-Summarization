in the dead of night , in the bohemian @entity2 district of @entity3 , a " guerrilla " street artist is about to start work
in his day job as a professional photographer he has been in riots where rocks and iron bars were being thrown
that has given him an almost innate sense of detecting danger , but as long as he is careful and quick , this particular installation should pass off without incident
he lurks in the shadows on @entity20 , near the junction of @entity22 with the tools he needs -- two stencils and two cans of aerosol paint , one black and one yellow
one last time , he glances up and down the street , making sure that " @entity30 " -- the name given to the @entity34 's @entity33 vehicles -- are not cruising nearby
with the coast clear , he gets down to work
ten minutes later it is done
he breathes a sigh of relief and steps back to admire his latest masterpiece
it is a stenciled image of fallen @entity43 hero @entity42
the @entity44 is depicted wearing that iconic yellow @entity48 leader 's jersey aerodynamically hunched over the handlebars of his bike
but something jars -- poking out of the disgraced cyclist 's back is an intravenous drip , a graphic reference to the 41 - year - old 's doping past that has finally caught up with him
@entity42 admits doping ' are there any heroes anymore ? ' in infamy , just as he did in fame , @entity42 continues to hold powerful sway over the public 's consciousness
over many years he had vehemently denied cheating as he bestrode the world of cycling in the process of winning seven successive @entity48 titles -- now taken away from him -- until confessing to @entity72 that he had used performance - enhancing drugs and had illicit blood transfusions
the credits had barely rolled on that interview before reports of book deals and film rights of his spectacular fall from grace began to emerge
now @entity42 has been immortalized in a piece of street art -- named " are there any heroes anymore ? " -- which is reminiscent of the subversive and polarizing exhibits of @entity90 graffiti artist @entity89 at his very best
" i was a keen cyclist , cycling three or four days weeks and doing a 90 - kilometer ride on a sunday , " the work 's creator " @entity93 " told @entity94 , explaining why he was moved to labor for several hours in his spare time with his scalpel to produce the two stencils that were used to create the @entity42 exhibit
" @entity42 was the ultimate cycling hero for me
he took cycling out of the geek enthusiast arena and brought it to a mainstream audience
people bought bikes and wore lycra because of @entity42 's profile , success and status , " says the 48 - year - old , who is also from @entity90 but moved to @entity42 in 2007
" i was following the story right from the start of the early drug allegations , and in conversations with friends , i 'd support @entity42 and tell them that he was just an just an exceptional cyclist , genetically designed that way
" i felt let down by @entity42 -- as i 'm sure fellow cyclists , sportsmen and the general public did
i wanted to convey that by a piece of art. " " @entity93 , " who chose that tag due to his atheism , previously ran a news photography agency in @entity127 that dealt with @entity90 's major newspapers -- hence his experience of covering riots
he continued to work as a photographer in the @entity43 but inspired by @entity89 -- his favorite image by the notoriously reclusive @entity136 is " @entity144 " -- he began to experiment with stencils , scalpels and aerosol cans in homage to a subculture that began on the streets of @entity143 in the 1970s
" the art is in the message -- it 's not about the technical quality of the piece , " said the 48 - year - old
" i like the simplicity of conveying a quite deep political or cultural message
" staying out of jail caution is the watchword when " @entity93 " heads out to pursue his alter ego 's creative impulses
" graffiti artists can face a $ 6,000 fine and imprisonment , and for multiple offenses it can lead to a federal court , which is very bad news , " says the artist , who has never been caught when daubing his impressions on @entity42 's walls
from graffiti to galleries : street vs. public art despite the risks , he loves his art so much he is considering giving up his day job as a photographer , though that depends on whether there is a demand for his work and " if i can stay out of jail
" his latest creation has already featured in the @entity180 as well as two @entity90 national newspapers , while the media coverage has led -- more bizarrely -- to two marriage proposals on @entity184
" ' @entity187 ? ' has been creating quite a buzz , " says @entity185 , editor - in - chief of the street art blog @entity22 and @entity3
" it could be said that ' plastic jesus ' is becoming the @entity89 of @entity42 " and , just as @entity89 has had problems with local councils cleaning up areas covered in his artwork , you might have to be quick if you want to see the latest message from " @entity93
" the owner of this particular wall , which is also a favored spot for other @entity42 street artists , whitewashes the graffiti away every so often ...
