-- i was in the security line at an airport a few months ago when i watched a fellow passenger do something i 'd never seen done before : he dissed the scan
" i 'd like to opt out , " he said , as a security agent went scurrying for a male agent to give this man a full - body pat - down , the requirement for anyone who refuses to go through the full - body scanner
wow , i thought , this man really must want to avoid the scanner if he 's willing to get groped by a total stranger
the @entity18 says the so - called backscatter scans , which emit a small amount of radiation , are safe
" multiple independent studies have confirmed that the technology used to protect passengers when they fly is safe for their health , " says @entity18 spokesman @entity22
" @entity18 takes many precautions to regularly verify that all machines are operating properly
" another type of airport scanner uses " millimeter wave " technology , which uses electromagnetic waves and has not raised the same level of public concerns as the backscatter scans
so why all the worry ? in my obnoxious journalist way , i pounced on the guy to ask him why he 'd done it
" i 'm a doctor at @entity42 , and i do n't want radiation if i can avoid it , " he said
i was next in line
i 'd just watched a doctor at @entity42 , a top cancer hospital , opt out because he wanted to avoid radiation
does that mean i should , too ? i had a second to make a decision
i decided to opt out , too
the pat - down , i learned , is not such an easy option
first , you have to make a bit of a spectacle of yourself by publicly asking for something different
secondly , it takes time ( not a lot , but enough to be a problem if you 're running late ) and thirdly , i ended up being touched in places previously reserved for my husband and my gynecologist
i began to wonder if the doctor was being a little paranoid
was the radiation so dangerous that it was worth the hassle and embarrassment ? to get a little perspective , when i returned home i randomly asked doctors i respect what they do in the security line
it was a completely unscientific sampling , but it yielded this interesting result : all these doctors are smart people with access to the same scientific data , and yet made very different choices
doctors who say " yes " to the scanners i started , of course , with my colleague dr. @entity82 , a neurosurgeon , who told me he has n't opted out thus far
many other doctors feel the same way
" i go through them , " said dr. @entity85 , chief of neurosurgery at @entity87 in @entity88
" the amount of radiation you get is n't worth worrying about
" dr. @entity93 , an internist and host of a new show on @entity96 that makes its debut on april 4 , called the amount of radiation " inconsequential
" the radiation you get from a backscatter imaging machine used at many airports is the same amount of radiation you get from sitting on an airplane for two minutes , according to research released this week by the @entity106
the researchers calculated for every 100 million passengers who fly seven one - way flights a year , six of them could get cancer as a result of the radiation exposure from the full - body scans
the @entity116 researchers made these calculations based on information from the manufacturers
some researchers question whether the manufacturers ' measurements are valid
@entity123 , director of the @entity124 at @entity125 , says he thinks the exposure to radiation is actually 10 times more than what the manufacturers claim
even so , @entity123 ( who 's a physicist , not a medical doctor ) still goes through the scanners at airports because even by his calculations the amount of radiation is still small
doctors who say " no " to the scanners dr. @entity136 , chief medical officer of the @entity137 , takes a pat - down instead of going through a scanner when he travels
he says he 's concerned about whether the machines are calibrated and inspected properly
" @entity143 did a piece on how badly @entity18 maintained their x-ray equipment for carryon bags , and this gave me little confidence , " he wrote to me in an e-mail
" i do whatever i can to avoid the scanner , " dr. @entity150 wrote to me in an e-mail
he says as a frequent flier , he 's concerned about the cumulative effect of the radiation
" this is a total body scan -- not a dental or chest x-ray , " he wrote to me
" total body radiation is not something i find very comforting based on my medical knowledge
" @entity150 says it does n't necessarily give him great comfort that the @entity18 says the scans are safe
" i can still remember getting my feet radiated as a child when i went to the shoe store and they had a machine which could see how my foot fit in the new shoes , " he says
" we were told then that they were safe , and they were not
" ( at first i thought @entity150 was making this up , but you can actually see one of these foot scanners at the @entity178 at the @entity178
) another doctor who opts for the pat - down is dr. @entity181 , rep. @entity182 ' neurosurgeon
" there is really no absolutely safe dose of radiation , " says @entity181 , chair of the department of neurosurgery at the @entity185
" each exposure is additive , and there is no need to incur any extra radiation when there is an alternative
" this was echoed by several other physicians , including dr. @entity197
" all radiation exposure adds to the cumulative total you 've received over your lifetime , " @entity197 wrote to me in an e-mail
" cancer risks correlate with that number , so no dose of radiation is too small to matter
" doctors exposed to radiation at work are particularly sensitive to this issue , as i learned when i got through security that day in the airport and chased after the doctor who 'd opted out
i learned his name is dr. @entity216 , and he 's a surgical oncology fellow at @entity42
he says this is a frequent topic of discussion among his colleagues
" if we can avoid a little radiation in exchange for the two extra minutes needed for a pat - down , then we will , " he says .
