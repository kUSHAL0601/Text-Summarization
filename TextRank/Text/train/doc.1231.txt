@entity0 , @entity1 -- the situation in @entity6 is accelerating , @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 said thursday , amid reports that president @entity9 's government may be preparing to use chemical weapons
" events on the ground in @entity6 are accelerating , and we see that in many different ways
the pressure against the regime in and around @entity22 seems to be increasing , " @entity15 said before meeting with @entity17 's foreign minister and the @entity19 special envoy to @entity6
chemical weapons were one topic on the table , said @entity15 , who met with the leaders while she was in @entity0 for an international security conference
@entity4 officials are " very concerned " that @entity9 's forces may use chemical weapons as rebels advance , @entity4 defense secretary @entity29 told reporters in @entity35 thursday
" the intelligence that we have raises serious concerns that this is being considered , " he said
the defense secretary did not provide additional details about the intelligence information
@entity2 reported monday that @entity6 forces battling rebels in fierce fighting had started combining chemicals that could be used to make deadly sarin gas for weapons
@entity48 reported wednesday night that @entity6 is loading chemical weapons into bombs
@entity2 has not confirmed the @entity48 report

" @entity6 would never use chemical weapons , even if it had them , against its own people , " he told @entity57 's @entity56
he also warned that any foreign intervention against @entity6 would be " catastrophic " for the entire region
in @entity0 thursday , @entity19 envoy @entity62 said leaders were focused on a peace process to " get @entity6 back from the brink
" " we have agreed that the situation is bad and we have agreed that we must continue to work together to see how we can find creative ways of bringing this problem under control and hopefully starting to solve it , " he told reporters after his meeting with @entity15 and @entity17 foreign minister @entity68
@entity17 has blocked action against @entity9 at the @entity19 , but some have speculated that @entity77 may be considering a different approach
on thursday , a top @entity17 politician said the @entity6 government " is not up to the task " of doing its job and can not " fulfill its functions , " the @entity80 news agency reported
@entity87 deputy speaker @entity86 said @entity17 wanted to create conditions where security forces inside @entity6 would take the situation under control , but @entity17 's " influence with the @entity6 leadership has been limited
" the comments from a close ally of president @entity96 came at a time when diplomats say @entity77 , which has insisted there should be no " regime change " in @entity6 , now increasingly doubts that @entity9 can survive in power
diplomatic efforts to help end the 21 - month conflict , which opposition activists say has claimed more than 42,000 lives , have so far failed
at least 89 people died thursday , most of them in @entity22 and @entity107 , according to the opposition @entity108
@entity2 can not confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within @entity6
@entity15 and @entity68 previously worked out a plan to try to end the fighting , but that plan ultimately stalled
that plan , negotiated in june in @entity117 , proposed the creation of a transitional government along with @entity9 leaving office
but @entity17 later balked at any @entity122 measure that would include sanctions or military action
@entity15 insisted any @entity19 resolution " have teeth
" the @entity4 has also expressed concerns about the increasing radicalization of some armed factions of the opposition and is moving toward declaring @entity131 a terrorist organization
such groups present a dilemma for the @entity4
@entity131 , officials say , has ruthless and effective fighters that are spearheading gains against @entity9 's weakening forces
@entity9 may be seeking asylum but the stronger the radical groups become , the more the @entity4 worries that the fighting -- not political efforts to find a solution -- will decide the outcome in @entity6
as a result , @entity35 has been pushing the opposition to unite
that process is unfolding with the recent creation of the @entity149
early next week , @entity15 will travel to @entity150 , @entity151 , for a meeting of the @entity153 , a gathering of countries that support the political transition
the @entity158 administration , while providing , for now , non-lethal assistance , is expected to take the first steps toward officially recognizing the @entity149 at that meeting
@entity15 also reiterated wednesday the strong @entity4 position set out by president @entity158 on monday over any possible use by @entity6 of chemical weapons
she said the international community is sending a clear message to @entity22
" our concerns are that an increasingly desperate @entity9 regime might turn to chemical weapons or might lose control of them to one of the many groups that are now operating within @entity6 , " she said
" and so , as part of the absolute unity that we all have on this issue , we have sent an unmistakable message that this would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account
" @entity19 @entity182 ban ki - moon said on a visit to @entity184 thursday that he had expressed his " gravest concerns " to @entity6 's government over any use of chemical weapons and had written directly to @entity9
he warned that anyone responsible for the use of chemical weapons would face serious consequences
@entity182 is to meet with the head of the @entity193 in @entity184 to discuss how it can work with the @entity19 on the issue

in addition to @entity214 , the @entity4 and @entity222 , both of which have @entity203 capabilities , have signaled they would be willing to contribute missiles
" any deployment will be defensive only
it will in no way support a no - fly zone or any offensive operation , " the @entity199 statement said
@entity199 's decision was made as the fears surfaced that the @entity9 regime might be preparing to use chemical weapons
" the @entity6 stockpiles of chemical weapons are a matter of great concern , " @entity199 secretary general @entity236 said
" we know that @entity6 possesses missiles
we know they have chemical weapons and , of course , they also have to be included in our calculations , " he said
" and this is also the reason why it is a matter of urgency to ensure effective defense and protection of our ally @entity201
" in the @entity4 , @entity255 sen. @entity254 said thursday that time may be running out
" if true , these reports may mean that the @entity4 and our allies are facing the prospect of an imminent use of weapons of mass destruction in @entity6 , and this may be the last warning we get , " @entity254 said
" the time for talking about what to do may now be coming to a close and we may instead be left with an awful and very difficult decision
