-- a @entity2 judge has dismissed former @entity5 dictator @entity4 's lawsuit against the creators of the " @entity9 " video game franchise
" this court concludes that @entity4 's right of publicity is outweighed by defendants ' @entity17 right to free expression , " judge @entity10 of the @entity11 said in an order monday
@entity4 -- who 's serving a prison sentence in @entity5 after being convicted of drug trafficking , money laundering and killing political opponents -- had argued that the 2012 video game " call of duty : @entity26 " damaged his reputation
creators of the video game called the lawsuit " frivolous " and " absurd
" they filed a motion to dismiss it , arguing that @entity4 's portrayal in the game is protected by the @entity33
" this ruling is an important victory and we thank the court for protecting free speech , " said former @entity35 mayor @entity34 , attorney for video game creator @entity36 " this was an absurd lawsuit from the very beginning and we 're gratified that in the end , a notorious criminal did n't win , " @entity34 said in a statement tuesday
" this is not just a win for the makers of ' @entity9 , ' but is a victory for works of art across the entertainment and publishing industries throughout the world
" @entity4 , 80 , filed the lawsuit in @entity11 in july , arguing that his portrayal " as a kidnapper , murderer and @entity62 " in the video game harmed his reputation
since the company used his image and name , the lawsuit said @entity4 was entitled to a share of the profits from the video game
what now ? " at this time , we are still reviewing the court 's order and conferring with our client to determine our next steps , " attorney @entity72 , who represents @entity4 , said in an email tuesday
@entity4 sues over ' @entity9 ' video game in 2012 , @entity36 said " call of duty : @entity26 " had netted more than $ 1 billion in sales worldwide in its first months on the market
the video game includes historical footage and several real - life characters in @entity88 scenarios , including former marine lt. col. @entity89
but while @entity90 did his own voiceover for the game and acted as an adviser , @entity4 said in the july lawsuit that he was n't consulted -- or compensated -- for the use of his likeness
" @entity9 " video games take storylines from current headlines , and its characters are based on historical figures , from former @entity104 leader @entity103 to @entity105 , the retired general and former @entity106 director
in a statement tuesday , @entity36 described the game as historical fiction and said @entity4 's lawsuit could have had far - reaching consequences if it had n't been thrown out
" in the unlikely event the lawsuit had been permitted to proceed , @entity4 's efforts could have provided numerous historical and political figures a veto right over their appearances in works of art , having a chilling effect on everything from movies like @entity123 and @entity124 , to television programs including @entity126 and @entity127 and even to popular books such as @entity129 , " the statement said
in court documents , @entity4 said he learned about the video game from his grandchildren , who told him that his image and likeness were being used
" @entity4 fails to provide any evidence of harm to his reputation , " @entity10 said in his ruling
" indeed , given the world - wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s , it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists
" for almost two decades , @entity4 was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the @entity147 because of its location on the @entity150 , the key strategic and economic waterway between the @entity152 and @entity153 oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the @entity155
amid growing unrest in @entity5 , then - @entity147 president @entity156 ordered the invasion of the @entity160 nation in december 1989 , saying @entity4 's rule posed a threat to @entity147 lives and property
12 more real people who appeared in video games @entity4 fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the @entity169 in @entity170
he surrendered in january 1990 and was escorted to the @entity147 for civilian trial
@entity4 was indicted in the @entity147 on charges of racketeering , laundering drug money and drug trafficking
he was accused of having links to @entity180 drug lord @entity179 's notorious @entity178 cartel and , in the process , amassing a multimillion - dollar fortune
he was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes and served nearly two decades in prison
in 2010 , a @entity187 court sentenced @entity4 to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros ( $ 2.9 million ) through banks there
he was ordered to pay the money back
in @entity5 , where he was convicted of killing political opponents , he has been hospitalized several times since he returned in 2011 to serve out his prison sentence
