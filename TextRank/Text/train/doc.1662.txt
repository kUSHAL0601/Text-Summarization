@entity0 , @entity1 -- the rev. @entity3 says he has a few aches and pains , but a good night 's sleep has done him some good as he recovers from being attacked saturday with a knife in a confessional at his church
the rev. @entity3 is recovering from two stab wounds that required 14 staples to close
it was one of the most harrowing weekends in the 28 years he 's been a @entity13 priest , @entity3 said
but it wo n't stop him from hearing confessions
" we 're at the mercy of the people we serve , " @entity3 told @entity2
" we ca n't live in fear
@entity20 has asked us to live in trust
if it 's going to happen again , it 's going to happen again , but that 's not going to prevent me from doing @entity20 's work
" @entity3 had just finished hearing confessions in his @entity1 church when he was stabbed twice in the back by a woman who later told police @entity3 is the @entity31
" it was paralyzing , like a nightmare , and i just feel like i woke up from it
it was so quick and sudden , " @entity3 said in a telephone interview
@entity0 police arrested @entity38 in connection with the attack
the 57 - year - old suspect is being held in the @entity42
she is being held without bail
@entity38 is scheduled to be arraigned on june 12
she has not yet been appointed a lawyer , prosecutors and the public defender said
" she believed [ @entity3 ] was the antichrist and it was her duty to go there and injure him , " police spokesman @entity47 said
@entity3 said he thought he had one last confession to hear at about 12:15 p.m. on saturday
a woman was waiting for him , apparently wanting to be be the last one in
" i was in the confessional , putting my coat on , and felt a piercing sensation in my back left side , " the priest recalled
" i looked up and she was standing there , and i felt it again in my back
then i realized i was stabbed and my hand was covered with blood
" @entity3 said his alleged attacker stared at him but never said a word
" i ran and got to the car and hoped i could make it to the hospital before i passed out
i was worried about becoming unconscious
thanks be to @entity20 that i did n't hurt anyone driving , " he said
an emergency room doctor told police that the knife " went through muscle , a few veins and chipped a rib , " according to an arrest affidavit
the blade missed vital organs by two to three centimeters , the affidavit said
@entity3 underwent surgery to repair the damage
doctors used 14 staples to close the " t " - shaped wounds
the priest feels compassion for the woman who attacked him , and he is turning the other cheek
" we have to continue to pray to do the church 's work
to love , and most of all to forgive , " he said
" to be sure she does n't do this again , she needs proper medical care
no one in their right mind would do this
" it was the second run - in with @entity38 at @entity103 , according to police and church workers
she was arrested in january , records show , accused of breaking off a piece of a religious statue inside the @entity109
she also allegedly resisted arrest and reached for the officer 's weapon
she was confronted by @entity113 , the parish manager
" i took it away from her and asked her why she did that , " @entity113 told @entity2
" she said she did it because it was from her husband 's funeral , forty years ago , and @entity119 stole it , and he was the @entity31 , " she said
@entity3 said he recognized @entity38 as he ran from the attack
" as i was running away from her , i realized who she was , " he said
" she did n't make any efforts to come after me
i was still in a state of shock
" at the hospital , @entity3 was able to pick @entity38 out of a photo lineup , police said
she was not at home when police went to question her , according to the arrest affidavit
later , police received an anonymous tip that she was staying elsewhere
when police arrived , @entity38 answered the door and allegedly stated , " you know who i am , and i know why you 're here
" @entity38 told detectives that " she remembers going over to @entity103 ( church ) ...
and stabbing mr. @entity3 , " according to the affidavit
when asked what she stabbed him with , the suspect replied , " it was a big knife , " the affidavit said
police say she told them that the knife was in three different places , but it was never located
@entity0 police say that @entity38 appears to be a troubled woman
" when you go back a second time , that raises more concerns
her violence escalated the second time , " said police spokesman @entity47
and just for the record , " i am not the @entity31 , that i know of , " @entity3 said with a laugh .
