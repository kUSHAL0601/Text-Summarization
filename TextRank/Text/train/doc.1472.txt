-- the @entity2 capital of @entity3 and the lavish @entity4 in the heart of @entity6 might be more than 1,000 miles apart , but for one day some seven decades ago the two places came much closer
on 17 july 1945 , @entity9 @entity8 of @entity10 gave birth to her son , crown prince @entity12 , in the hotel 's 212 suite
then @entity16 prime minister @entity15 designated the room @entity18 territory for the day so that the baby prince could retain his right to the throne
" it was an extraordinary act that he did , " recalls crown prince @entity12
in 1941 , @entity24 invaded and occupied @entity10 forcing the country 's @entity25 -- @entity27 -- to move into exile in @entity6
later on , he was banned from returning home by the @entity31 government that followed @entity32 @entity12 , who was baptized by @entity9 and her father @entity33 , grew up abroad and only visited his country for the first time in 1991
ten years later , he returned to live in @entity3 after the country 's government decided to give him and his family the right to use the city 's royal palaces , which were taken from the royals when they were stripped of their possessions and citizenship by the communists
" i never thought we 'd come back here -- i really did n't , " he says
the power of religion after decades abroad , the return home signaled many first experiences for the @entity12 -- and one of those included celebrating the @entity53 , @entity54 , in @entity2
" it 's even more meaningful doing it at home , very much so , " says @entity12 , who has today a strictly ceremonial role
the @entity2 @entity60 religion is closely bound to the country 's identity -- around 85 % of the 7.2 million population declare themselves as @entity60
since his return in 2001 , crown prince @entity12 has enjoyed the feast of @entity54 as an open , inter faith celebration -- a turning point for @entity2 history
" it 's wonderful and very moving for me to see that he has accomplished that because they 're all together sitting and talking to each other , " says the @entity12 's wife , @entity72 crown princess @entity71
" it 's hard to believe this country was in conflict so many years ago and for such a long time
" luckily , it seems that those days are over
