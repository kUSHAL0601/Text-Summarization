it 's not easy being @entity1 and it is about to become even more difficult , again
sandwiched in between @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity1 's destiny seems to be one of a constant struggle for survival
this violent storyline was written over a decade ago during the @entity4 war
the latest outbreak of violence after @entity13 swept through @entity14 and beyond has @entity1 's inner circle and the business community drawing up worst scenarios , with @entity5 and @entity4 representing bookends of trouble
@entity1 is now home to more than 1.3 million @entity5 refugees , half absorbed during the last 24 months
as a sign of the times , on a video shoot down to the @entity27 region two hours south @entity28 , we saw scores of second hand @entity31 tents that are now being utilized by @entity33
the refugee crisis is costing @entity1 $ 3 billion a year , about a quarter of the kingdom 's annual budget expenditure , according to finance minister @entity37
in an interview in @entity28 , the former central banker made some strong statements , albeit delivered in his affable , soft - spoken manner
" the extraordinary burden of the @entity5 crisis , as well as any potential regional crisis including the @entity4 situation , should also be met by the international community , " @entity37 told me
" there should be much more international assistance
" youth unemployment of over 24 % is keeping pressure on the government
@entity5 are now competing against @entity1 for low - paying jobs , whether in hospitality or light manufacturing
@entity37 said a half billion dollars in total was received last year between the @entity58 and @entity59
while the government is appreciative of that support and loan guarantees to help lower the debt burden , in reality it is not enough to plug a gaping hole in @entity1 's finances
the budget deficit is running above 9 % of @entity69 , although government officials suggest growth of 5 % would have been possible without @entity4 factored in
but @entity4 is now very much part of the equation
oil imports have been cut off for the past few months as violence has escalated
a sizeable $ 1.8 billion oil export pipeline from @entity77 in southern @entity4 to the @entity79 @entity1 port of @entity80 may be delayed , sources suggest , due to the violence
@entity83 's master plan for growth has been subject to a series of setbacks
@entity1 signed a free trade agreement with the @entity58 in 2000 , the same year it joined the @entity88
he is often referred to in the @entity90 community as the business friendly monarch , who remains a close ally of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95
but , members of his cabinet suggest , the @entity83 's role as a voice of moderation in a zone of chaos should not be taken for granted
" we feel we are not getting enough to continue to play our moderating role in the region and meeting the needs of all those refugees is not only a humanitarian issues , it also neutralizes any extremist tendencies , " said @entity37
