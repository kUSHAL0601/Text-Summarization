@entity0 -- in the years leading up to 2011 , several celebrities , royals and politicians had claimed to have had their phones hacked by @entity6
the paper 's royal editor and a private investigator had even been convicted of intercepting phone messages and spent time in prison
the story was covered on the inside pages of selected newspapers but failed to really capture the @entity17 public 's attention
that all changed in july of that year when the @entity19 reported that police suspected the cellphone of murdered teenager @entity22 had been hacked by @entity6 and that messages had been deleted to free up space for new voicemail
the allegations sparked outrage : amid condemnation from politicians on all sides of the spectrum , the paper 's boss @entity27 closed down the 168 - year - old tabloid newspaper and paid @entity37 's parents and charities more than $ 4 million in compensation
at a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations , @entity27 declared : " this is the most humble day of my life
" timeline of phone - hacking scandal when @entity48 's parents appeared at the @entity49 set up by the government to investigate press ethics , they gave a raw assessment of the false hope that the deletion of messages had raised in the days after their daughter 's disappearance in march 2002
" i rang her phone , " recalled @entity37
" it clicked through on to her voicemail , so i heard her voice and it was just like , ' she 's picked up her voicemail , she 's alive
' " tragically , those hopes were dashed and six months later @entity48 's body was found in woodland in @entity68 in southern @entity69
although it was suspected that the deletion of the messages hampered the police investigation , the truth may have been more prosaic : later that year a lawyer acting for the country 's biggest force , the @entity73 , said there was no evidence @entity6 had been responsible for deleting the messages
the @entity19 issued a clarification , but the damage had been done to @entity6 and @entity27 's reputation
whatever took place , the fact remains that it took police nine years to bring nightclub bouncer @entity88 to justice
in june 2011 he was found guilty of murdering @entity22 and sentenced to life imprisonment
during the trial the jury was told @entity88 had previously murdered two other women and attempted to kill a fourth
so who was the girl whose murder in a quiet suburb of southwest @entity0 led to the closure of the @entity17 's top - selling paper , suspicions of collusion between police officers and journalists , and at one time even threatened to topple @entity27 from the media group he had led for half a century ? the scandal also led to charges being brought against several @entity27 employees , including two of prime minister @entity111 's friends
press dishes it out , but can it take it ? despite her extraordinary legacy , by most accounts @entity22 , who was known as @entity48 , was a normal , bright 13 - year - old schoolgirl who had a good relationship with her parents and elder sister @entity122
her friends testified during @entity88 's trial in @entity0 that she had a sunny personality and was her normal self on the day of her disappearance
" she was one of the funniest people i had ever met , " @entity128 said in a statement
" she would always be trying to make people laugh , joking and smiling
" she was one of those sort of people that when she was happy she was exceptionally happy , an infectious personality
if she was sad about something she would be particularly sad and get upset
she valued her friendships and family a lot
" @entity128 , who was one of the last people to see @entity48 alive , said she ate chips with her friend in a @entity143 Â© in @entity144 after school
" we parted and i gave her a hug and asked if she would be alright walking home on her own and she said , ' yeah , i 'll be absolutely fine
' " i then turned around and shouted back at her ' i would not tell anyone what we had been talking about
' " @entity128 added that they had been discussing a boy whom @entity48 fancied
after the friends parted , @entity48 started to walk to her home nearby , but was snatched by @entity88 as she walked along a road
@entity48 's sister also told the court she knew instinctively something was wrong when she returned home to find the house empty
she said : " i knew @entity48 would n't go out without telling @entity162 or @entity163
i rang @entity48 's mobile
it was switched off so i left a message on her answer phone telling her to come home because @entity163 was really annoyed
" i was worried because @entity48 would always ring to tell us she was going to be late
it was so unusual for her not to be home on time
i knew instinctively something bad had happened to @entity48 and that she had been abducted
" @entity48 's disappearance sparked a nationwide search involving more than 100 police officers and a reconstruction of her last movements on the tv program " @entity185
" detectives from @entity188 police however suggested she had not been taken by force and had run away
some friends indeed portrayed a different side to @entity48 , suggesting she had been " distressed " at the time of disappearance , after finding bondage pornography belonging to her father @entity193
police initially considered him a suspect , but later apologized
in a statement read to the court , @entity198 said : " @entity48 told me some pornographic magazines had been found in her @entity163 's drawer
" at the time @entity48 was a bit upset about it , not much for herself but her mum
i know that @entity48 did see them and there was more than one of them
" during the trial @entity88 's lawyers used this testimony , along with a " goodbye " note that @entity48 had written to her parents and a poem in which she said " i hate myself , " to paint a picture of the teenager as unhappy and distressed
his tactics caused great distress to the family , but the jury failed to believe his plea of innocence
@entity225 , the author of a book on @entity227 , " @entity228 , " told @entity1 that in the wake of the 2011 trial , during which the @entity232 were pilloried by the tabloids over the pornography revelations , the family grew to loathe the press
it was in this atmosphere that the revelation was made about the hacking of @entity48 's phone , which became , according to @entity225 , " the defining moment from which @entity6 could not recover
" " i do n't think it 's as simple as the fact that @entity22 's phone was hacked and that led to the end of the @entity6
i think there are more layers to the story than that , and we may never know what actually happened
