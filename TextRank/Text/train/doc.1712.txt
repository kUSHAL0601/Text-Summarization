@entity0 , @entity1 -- a day after he made a swift exit from an @entity0 court when a judge revoked his bail , former @entity1 president @entity3 appeared before a magistrate on friday and was formally placed under house arrest
the development is the latest setback to @entity3 since the former military ruler returned to @entity1 last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country 's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections
his arrest also highlights the increased willingness of @entity1 's judiciary , who clashed with @entity3 during his time in power , to pursue cases against high - profile figures previously considered to be untouchable
no former @entity1 army chief has previously been arrested and detained
amid a long - running fight with the judiciary , @entity3 resigned as president of @entity1 in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year , living in @entity33 and @entity34
he came back to @entity1 last month under heavy security
but so far , his return does not seem to be going according to plan
earlier this week , @entity1 election officials barred @entity3 from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month , a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge
that decision appears to have emboldened members of the judiciary , many of whom have bitter memories of their treatment by @entity3 during his time in power
but the legal drama concerning a former head of the army appeared to be fueling concerns about how the powerful @entity1 military might respond , with the country under the management of a caretaker government ahead of the elections next month
" the fears that the army might sharply react if the cases are taken to their logical conclusion hang in the air , " @entity59 , an @entity60 newspaper , wrote in an editorial friday
" but @entity1 is now irrevocably destined for a democratic transition , and on this , all institutions agree
" accused of detaining judges the @entity71 had ordered @entity3 's arrest on thursday in a case in which he is accused of illegally ordering the detention of senior judges in 2007
the high court said in its ruling that it was an " act of terrorism " to prevent the judges from doing their job
but he quickly left the building after the judge announced the decision , returning to his farmhouse compound outside the @entity1 capital
his legal status at that point was unclear
local media reported he had been placed under house arrest , but the judge 's order for his arrest remained outstanding
on friday morning , local broadcaster @entity95 broadcast images of @entity3 arriving at a court building accompanied by uniformed police officers and other members of the security forces
@entity1 authorities have provided some of his heavy security detail since his return
@entity0 police spokesman @entity105 said officers had formally arrested @entity3 and produced him before a magistrate in court
but @entity109 , a spokesman for @entity3 's political party said the former president had presented himself in court
he said @entity3 denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007
farmhouse arrest after appearing before the magistrate on friday , @entity3 was allowed to return to his farmhouse , which has been converted into a " sub jail " where he is being held under house arrest , according to his lawyer , @entity120
@entity3 will continue to seek bail in the case , @entity120 said
an attempt on thursday to appeal the @entity0 court 's decision at the @entity126 appeared to have so far been unsuccessful
@entity120 said that @entity127 , the @entity0 high court judge who ordered @entity3 's arrest , is one of the judges whom @entity3 is alleged to have had detained in 2007
as a result , @entity120 said , @entity127 should have recused himself from the case
@entity127 was n't immediately available for comment on friday
in another step in the process , @entity3 will have to appear in court again next week
he had previously received bail extensions in the cases concerning him
he was also initially granted " protective " bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to @entity1
but the judiciary appears to have taken a more aggressive line than he may have expected , stepping up the pursuit of cases against him
when asked last week about his fears of arrest , @entity3 brushed the question aside
a mixed reception in @entity1 @entity3 was disqualified from contesting elections in @entity1 because of the state of emergency he declared in 2007
even though he has n't been tried for that action , the move was ruled an act of treason , making him ineligible to run for office
@entity3 maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts
some @entity1 are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler , hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence
but he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency , notably among the judges he allegedly detained
the @entity1 @entity166 vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country , though @entity3 has said he has been living under threats of death since september 11 , 2001 , when he supported the @entity173 war on terror and fought against the @entity166
the former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999
@entity3 's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation 's @entity126 chief justice for " misuse of authority
" the move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence a court decision on whether he could seek another term in office
