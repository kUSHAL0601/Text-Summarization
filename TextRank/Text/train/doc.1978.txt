@entity8 took off shortly before 7 a.m. wednesday from an airfield in @entity10 , 80 miles northeast of @entity11
the plane was piloted by @entity13 , who flew to a height of nearly 28,000 feet ( 8,500 meters )
" i 've been a pilot for 40 years now , but this flight has been the most incredible one of my flying career , " @entity13 said , according to the @entity15
" just sitting there and watching the battery charge level rise and rise thanks to the sun. i have just flown more than 26 hours without using a drop of fuel and without causing any pollution
" during the evening , the plane slowly descended to an altitude of 4,500 feet ( 1,500 meters ) , where it remained for the rest of the night using battery power
an hour before dawn , the plane still had six hours of flying time left in its solar - fueled batteries
@entity8 has a wingspan of more than 206 feet ( 63 meters ) -- the same as an @entity36 -- and is nearly 72 feet ( 22 meters ) long
it weighs about 3,500 pounds ( 1,600 kilograms ) and has nearly 12,000 solar cells attached to its wings and horizontal stabilizers
the plane is equipped with four electric engines and has a top speed of about 43 miles ( 70 kilometers ) per hour
" the goal of the project is to have a solar - powered plane flying day and night without fuel , " said the co-founder of the project , @entity46
the @entity7 adventurer , who piloted the first nonstop balloon flight around the world in 1999 in the @entity54 , said the test flight was " crucial for the credibility of the project
" the challenge to fly a solar plane around the world was announced in 2003
with the success of the test flight , a second airplane will be designed to fly much farther next year , with the aim of flying across continents and the @entity65
in 2012 , the team hopes to fly @entity8 around the world in five stages .
