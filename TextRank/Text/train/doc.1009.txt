six other @entity4 hostages are still being held in @entity5 , @entity1 said
the spokesman reportedly told the agency that the march 10 execution was in response to @entity4 's military intervention in @entity5 , and that @entity4 president @entity18 " is responsible for the lives of the rest of the hostages
" before the @entity1 report on tuesday , the @entity4 foreign ministry released a statement quoting @entity18 as saying there are no " financial discussions " ongoing to gain the release of @entity4 hostages in various countries
the ministry said it is in constant contact with the families of those being held , and that everything is being done to gain the release of @entity4 hostages

@entity42 extremists carved out a large haven in northern @entity5 last year , taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party @entity47
