-- in @entity2 , a woman pushed a small grocery cart with a single bag inside
in it , a precious possession shielded from prying eyes : a red can filled with gasoline
in the wake of @entity12 , gasoline might as well be gold
" it has become a hot commodity , so we did n't want to risk it , " she said
with lines snaking for blocks -- miles , even -- outside gas stations in @entity22 and @entity23 , tensions occasionally flared as people waited for the chance to to pump gas into cars or gas cans
" the situation is hectic , " said @entity29 , a @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity23
" many gas stations are either out of gas or ( will be ) soon
" the demand is high , and the fuel is n't just for empty car tanks
many people still have no electricity and are using gasoline - powered generators , adding to the demand
temperatures drops , tempers rise in power outage " as word spreads that somewhere has gas , there are ( lines of ) cars as long or longer than the one in my video , " @entity29 said
federal and state authorities acted on two fronts friday to address the issues -- both to bring more fuel to the area , and to more fairly distribute what is already there
at president @entity61 's direction , the @entity59 will buy up to 12 million gallons of unleaded fuel and up to 10 million gallons of diesel that will be moved on tanker trucks to replenish stocks in @entity22 , @entity23 and other areas experiencing severe gas shortages
in order to ration and decrease wait times , @entity23 gov. @entity68 signed an executive order friday tying whether a driver gets gas to his or her license plate number
it goes into effect in 12 counties at noon saturday
on days that end in even numbers -- such as november 4 , 6 or 8 -- gas station operators can sell gas to only those with license plates with a last digit that is even
on odd - digit days , such as november 3 , only those with plate numbers ending in an odd number or those with specialty plates can get gas
in @entity23 , only station attendants can pump gas
" this system will ease the strain on those gas stations still operating , while we work to bring more online for the public to access fuel , in a manner that is fair , easy to understand and less stressful , " @entity68 said
7 health risks after @entity12 @entity102 , who is nine months pregnant , said she had been waiting for more than five hours to fill up at a gas station in @entity104 , @entity23
she had used what little gas she had left to drive to her last doctor 's appointment
" but i did n't find out until i got there that they did n't have power either , so now i need gas to get back home , " she said
the gas station 's manager , @entity113 , has been working day and night alongside his staff to keep the station running and was confident that @entity117 would be able to fill up
" i even stay until after midnight for my friends who are taxi and limousine drivers , because they have to feed their families , too , " he said
for the most part , people have remained remarkably cool
as a precaution , police are helping to keep the lines in order at some gas stations
in other areas , there was a sense of organized chaos that sometimes veered more toward disorder
at a station in @entity136 , @entity22 , police arrested a man early thursday after he cut in line and then pulled out a gun when he was challenged by other residents
@entity12 roared ashore monday night , knocking out power to millions of people , and flooding mass transit systems across the @entity144
three days later , more than 1 million people in @entity22 and 1.4 million in @entity23 are still without power
powerless in @entity23 the demand for gasoline is only going to rise , with @entity22 's subway system still out of commission -- meaning more people are forced to travel by car -- and a forecast of cold weather for @entity22 and @entity23 this weekend
most major gas station chains , from @entity155 to @entity156 , were experiencing disruptions
in fact , some 60 % of gas stations tracked by @entity159 in @entity23 were not operational , according to the motorist group
in @entity22 's @entity163 , that figure was 65 %
economic impact of gas shortages @entity0 's @entity166 explained that a lot of the closed gas stations simply do n't have electricity to operate their pumps , while others can not get gasoline delivered to the station from the refinery because of blocked roads or other logistical problems created by the storm
and even with government efforts to address the problems , gas shortages could stretch " though the weekend and into the next , " according to @entity179 , an analyst for @entity180
to cope with the overwhelming demand , some stations limited their services to emergency vehicles only
other stations only provided gas for people 's gas cans , and not their cars
many gas stations set limits to how much gas each person could pump : maybe $ 20 , or maybe $ 50
desperate residents -- who at least had enough power to charge their mobile devices -- used social media to try to avoid long lines or empty gas stations
@entity201 users in @entity23 created the hashtags # njgas and # njopen to provide real - time information on open gas stations , the length of the line , and any restrictions
" @entity209 gas on @entity211 street near jersey ave in @entity213 is open and line is less than 30 minutes , " tweeted @ johnnymatson
" this guy turned a blocked driveway into a business opp for those of us in line for gas , " tweeted @ @entity215 , along with an @entity217 picture of a man smiling behind a table with two coffee dispensers
some @entity201 messages revealed that red gas cans were quickly becoming just as scarce as gasoline itself
others offered some humorous perspective on the situation : @entity235 , offered this : " some perspective
the @entity239 winner will run the marathon in less time than the average ( gas ) lines
" in the end , @entity22 marathon did n't feel right @entity0 's @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .
