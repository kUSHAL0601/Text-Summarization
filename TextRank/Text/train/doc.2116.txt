the first woman elected to the @entity1 will answer to many names -- madam president , ma'am , and , most likely , @entity4
that 's something i like to think about on @entity8
given the demographics and family status of many of the women in politics today , there 's a pretty good chance that the first female who gets to sit behind the historic @entity17 in the @entity18 will be a mother of young children
think that 's crazy ? it 's not and here 's why
the current female up - and - comers entered the world of politics earlier than their predecessors and are , like so many women today , waiting to have or adopt children until their 30s and 40s
as a result , the year 2016 will likely present a perfect storm of timing and circumstances for a president to be sworn in who looks like @entity38 ' character @entity37 of the short - lived tv series , " commander in chief
" i do n't have a crystal ball , but i have my fingers crossed that many political mothers who are in the queue , so to speak , have their eyes on more than just keeping the jobs they have now
they 're not waiting until their children are out of the house to make their next political moves
when former speaker of the house @entity54 was first elected to @entity56 , she was 47 years old and four of her five children were already out of the house and in college with the fifth one in high school
that was the model for women interested in national political office : wait to run until the kids were grown
that is , until former @entity69 gov. @entity68 opened the door to the idea of a young mom who could run for the @entity1
even for voters who were n't fans of @entity68 's political views , she became the new face of women in the arena -- someone knee deep in the details of child - rearing , as well as policymaking and vote counting -- a vision that resonated because most mothers in @entity86 are working mothers juggling their own careers and families
there is a growing list of female contenders whose work - life balance stories will resonate with female voters who are also trying to find the right mix of working hours to support their families and time at home with the kids
one name to remember is @entity100 , a @entity101 senator from @entity102
she is 45 and not only is she firmly ensconced in her political career , she 's also the mother of two sons , ages 9 and 5
@entity100 is on at least one short list ( if @entity107 keeps her word about not running for president again ) of potential @entity101 candidates for the @entity1 in 2016
with the launch of her recent bipartisan off the @entity114 project to encourage more women to run for office , as well as her online book club , it certainly looks like she 's laying the social media groundwork for something in four years
as for @entity122 women , they 've got 42 - year - old @entity123 , a representative from @entity124
do n't know her name ? you 'd probably recognize her face , because she is usually one of the few standing behind speaker of the house @entity129 at all those news conferences
@entity132 is the mother of a 1Â½ - year - old daughter and a 5 - year - old son , and wields plenty of political power and influence as the highest - ranking @entity122 woman in @entity56
she has a major voice in what issues make it to a vote
these are just two of the high - profile political mothers who can just as easily and naturally manage the @entity124 power game as they can their children 's homework , play dates and soccer schedules
political women who embrace electoral leadership while parenting young children are becoming much more common
others include rep. @entity155 of @entity156 , who is also the head of the @entity158 , @entity122 @entity160 gov. @entity159 , and @entity122 sen. @entity161 of @entity162
the new generation of political women can bring to office a set of life experiences that will inform national policy issues in a new way
we would be able to have discussions about paid family leave , paid sick time and paid maternity leave and have it viewed through the lens of a commander in chief who would have real - time experience with what it means to leave work to pick up a sick child
there are plenty of moms to choose from for increasing powerful national leadership roles
so many female voters choreograph their own work - life balance dance
a woman who knows that struggle firsthand might just be the kind of candidate who will be elected to the @entity18 .
