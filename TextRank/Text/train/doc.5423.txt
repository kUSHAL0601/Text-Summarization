@entity0 -- a @entity3 cleric leading a self - proclaimed movement to clean up politics in @entity6 by throwing out the current leaders in favor of a caretaker administration called on thousands of supporters to join his campaign
" it 's the beginning of the revolution , " @entity13 told a rally in @entity0
" dissolve federal and provincial governments by tomorrow morning ; otherwise , the public will force them to step down ! " @entity13 urged the demonstrators to remain in the capital until they achieve their goals
" now and onward , you have to take care of @entity0 , " he said
he referred to president @entity23 as ex-president and to prime minister @entity25 as ex-prime minister
" today , the president and the prime minister have become ex as ( they ) wo n't have their government tomorrow , " he said
the rally was held monday night in @entity0 's " blue zone " in the center of the capital
the group 's numbers fell far short of what organizers of the " @entity38 " had predicted , with witnesses estimating that some 20,000 people took part
many more followed the event on television as the participants , led by @entity13 , headed toward @entity0 with police and soldiers lining the rally route
@entity49 showed a convoy of buses , vans and cars packed with participants waving the national flag en route to the capital
some joined the procession on foot
@entity13 , who traveled in a bulletproof van , has promised a @entity6 equivalent of @entity65 's @entity64 protests
when the marchers arrived at the rally site , near @entity69 and the presidential home , they joined more than 1,000 other protesters who had arrived earlier in the day as part of a demonstration calling for cleaning up national politics before elections this year
" we want change in the establishment and we want to save our country , " one man told @entity1 affiliate @entity77

one man in a male - only area told @entity77 viewers watching at their homes that change does not occur while sitting down
" we all must rally and come together for change and a better future and stronger @entity6 , " he said
one female protester , rallying in the space provided for women and children , said she was prepared for a long demonstration
" we have come here with our bedding and food supplies , " she told @entity77
" we will stay here for as long as it takes to change the present situation in @entity6
" @entity13 has called for a caretaker administration to replace the current government and to carry out election reforms
his suggestion that the judiciary and the military weigh in on the composition of the interim government has raised concerns in a country where military leaders have repeatedly seized power and ruled for long periods of time
some @entity6 , noting that @entity13 served as a lawmaker in the early 2000s , when gen. @entity132 was leading the country , have suggested he may be working on behalf of the military

the current government and opposition have both rejected his requests for a caretaker administration , insisting that nothing will stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process
" we will not succumb to these illegal demands , " @entity89 said last week
party withdraws support the only political party that had supported @entity13 's demonstration , the @entity153 , withdrew that support last week
the movement is a coalition partner in the current government
if this year 's elections take place without major difficulties , it would represent the first time in @entity6 's history that a civilian government would have made it through a five - year term
supporters say that @entity13 aims to effect positive change
corruption is widely considered a chronic problem in @entity6 's political system ; president @entity23 has served prison time on corruption charges
the problem appears to be regional
@entity13 's campaign comes more than a year after anti-corruption demonstrator @entity176 roiled @entity178 politics with a hunger strike that called for the introduction of strong anti-graft measures
@entity182 gained worldwide attention in 2010 when he declared a fatwa , or religious ruling , on terrorism and said it " can not be permissible in @entity3
" that occurred during his time in @entity86 , when he spoke out in videos and books
his supporters also point to his @entity193 - based religious welfare organization , @entity192 , which promotes " true @entity3 teachings
" according to its website , it has up to 280,000 members worldwide and works to build schools around the country to teach the @entity201
