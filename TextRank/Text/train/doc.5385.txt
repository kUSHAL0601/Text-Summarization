@entity0 has vanquished terrorists , basement rapists and the defenses of @entity4
but in his three decades in @entity5 he may not have faced as daunting an opponent as @entity7
according to an unconfirmed report in a @entity10 publication , @entity0 wants to bequeath his extensive @entity12 music collection to his daughters -- something that 's not permitted under the current @entity12 terms
the @entity16 says the actor has spent thousands of dollars downloading music on to " many , many @entity19 " but , like many @entity12 users , was surprised to discover that in @entity7 's eyes he does n't actually own the songs
the @entity16 , without citing any sources , says @entity0 is considering legal action against @entity7 to gain control over the music
@entity27 could not confirm the report monday , and a request sent to representatives for @entity0 was not immediately returned
the " @entity33 " actor 's wife , @entity31 , cast doubt on the report when she said monday on @entity36 , " it 's not a true story
" but the news reports , exaggerated or not , do raise potentially significant issues about ownership of digital music and whether someone could pass on digital assets to heirs
@entity7 's terms and conditions for @entity12 are an exhaustive , jargon - filled document that users must " agree " to before downloading content but that many people do n't bother to read
in simplified terms , they state that when we buy music from @entity12 , we are paying for the license to listen to songs via our @entity58 , @entity19 or other @entity7 device
but we are not buying the music itself
" when you buy a book , you own the copy of that book but not the actual material , " @entity61 , a @entity62 - based entertainment attorney who specializes in digital media and intellectual property , told @entity27 last year
" what you are buying here is right to use music on certain devices
" if @entity0 did take on @entity7 over ownership of his @entity12 collection , he might have an uphill legal battle
the @entity12 terms are essentially a contract between the user and @entity7 , and clicking " agree " counts as an electronic signature , digital - media lawyers say
nothing would stop @entity0 from leaving music - loaded laptops or phones to his children , although things would get more complicated if his kids tried to transfer the songs to other devices
@entity7 limits use of digital music to @entity7 gadgets used by the @entity12 account holder
@entity7 also prohibits users from downloading songs to more than 10 devices , or burning a playlist more than seven times
@entity0 , 57 , has three adult daughters with ex-wife @entity101 and a young daughter with current wife @entity103
@entity7 did not respond monday to a request for comment
the company 's formidable legal team last month won a $ 1 billion judgment against rival @entity109 in a patent dispute
other online music retailers , such as @entity112 and @entity113 , impose similar restrictions on downloads
@entity0 was trending on @entity36 monday , with some commenters poking fun at the issue
wrote one @entity36 user , " i do n't know what 's more shocking @entity0 suing @entity7 ... or the fact he actually read the @entity123 and conditions
