if you 're planning to enjoy this spring or summer at a national park , you 'd better leave your drone at home
on friday , @entity4 in @entity5 turned heads when it announced that drones , the unmanned aircraft increasingly making their way into private hands , are n't welcome in the park , famous for its picturesque valley of towering granite cliffs , waterfalls and @entity17 groves
apparently using drones to capture experiences at the park , on the western edge of the @entity23 mountains , is becoming a trend
" the park has experienced an increase in visitors using drones within park boundaries over the last few years , " park management said in a news release
" drones have been witnessed filming climbers ascending climbing routes , filming views above tree - tops , and filming aerial footage of the park
" and it 's not just @entity4
the buzzing aerial machines , which have become handy for everything from scaring off unwanted birds to delivering medicine and pizzas , are n't welcome at any of the 58 national parks
15 ways drones will change your life " the ... regulations cited at @entity4 apply at all units of the @entity54 , " spokesman @entity49 said in an e-mail to @entity51
the @entity55 states that " delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute , helicopter , or other airborne means , except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss , or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit " is illegal
the parks system says that applies to drones , though privately owned , unmanned aircraft probably were n't on anyone 's mind when it was written
@entity4 's news release cited a list of ways the aircraft can be harmful
among them : ruining the experience for visitors with their noise , interfering with rescue operations and endangering wildlife in the area -- particularly the peregrine falcons that nest in the park 's cliff walls
a quick search on @entity88 finds a host of of videos shot using drones at @entity4 and other national parks
some merely show shaky video from beginners sending their craft into the sky for the first time , while others are more professional productions that provide breathtaking views of the park 's mountains , trees and cyclists and hikers
in a bit of irony , firefighters used a drone to battle the @entity111 blaze that raged in and around the park last august .
