the crowded world of social media apps got squeezed a bit tighter with the introduction of @entity4 on tuesday
the social q&a app from @entity6 , a co-founder of @entity7 , relies on photos and friends to find answers to questions that may not fit neatly into a @entity13 search , such as , " what kind of flower is this ? " sure , people can turn to their @entity17 or @entity7 feeds to ask which backpack to buy , or where to responsibly dispose of or donate old @entity21 chargers ( both real questions currently appearing on @entity4 )
the technology is n't new
neither is turning to friends for help with everything from where to eat in @entity29 to suggestions for an 8 - year - old 's birthday party
but @entity6 is hoping @entity33 makes this experience fun while helping users find answers faster
the dedicated social - search app is free of news feed and timeline clutter , while still allowing you to make use of your social network
we spoke to @entity6 over the phone tuesday about how @entity33 works
his answers informed these instructions : using @entity33 is simple enough
open the app , connect your social networks ( @entity17 's platform app must be turned on ) and users are immediately prompted to either look through pending questions ( " 7 people need help " ) or snap a photo
users can add links and draw on a photo before sharing a question with others
seeing questions and answers from unfamiliar people ? @entity6 says the app works much like @entity65 , where " 2nd degree " connections will appear
in other words , users will be asking questions and receiving answers from friends as well as friends of friends
to follow a question , simply tap the " favorite " star in the upper right corner and notifications will appear within the app. but if you dismiss a question , you ca n't go back to it later when you think of the answer or remember you have a friend on @entity17 who probably knows it
questions also can be shared outside the app and answered via the web by people who do n't use @entity33
these answers show up as " forwarded by ... " @entity6 says in the future they 'd like to figure out a way to connect names with outside answers , but it is n't a top priority right now
users can also rate answers to their own questions , and to other users ' questions , as " good , " and send virtual " thank - you cards " to helpful respondents
so far , customer ratings for @entity4 in @entity107 are mostly positive
for a short time @entity4 experienced an error which prevented users from connecting and logging in , which appears to be the reason for most posted complaints
some meaner critics called the app " pretty but pointless
" some also have criticized @entity33 's inability to sort through questions , see questions only from certain users or filter results
in response , @entity6 said that categorizing questions defeats the purpose of using your entire social network
but he emphasized that he 's open to the wishes of the nascent @entity4 community , and the idea of sortable questions is not completely out of the question in the future .
