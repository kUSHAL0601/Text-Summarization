@entity1 prime minister @entity0 signed the political elements of a trade pact with the @entity4 on friday , even as @entity6 lawmakers finalized annexation of @entity1 's @entity8
the signing in @entity10 signals @entity12 's solidarity with @entity1 -- and carries additional symbolic force because it was the decision by @entity1 president @entity14 in november to ditch the trade pact in favor of closer ties with @entity6 that triggered the protests that led to his ouster in february and spiraled into the current crisis
it also comes a day after the @entity4 and the @entity23 slapped sanctions on @entity6 lawmakers and businessmen ; @entity6 responded with its own list of sanctions against a number of @entity23 lawmakers and officials
in another sign of defiance , @entity6 president @entity32 , flanked by the speakers of both houses of @entity35 , signed a treaty friday finalizing the accession to @entity6 of the @entity8 region and its port city of @entity42
the upper house unanimously approved ratification of the treaty a day after @entity6 's lower house of @entity35 , the @entity47 , passed it by an overwhelming margin
the political crisis has been the biggest blow to @entity6 's relations with the @entity52 since the @entity53
in a sign that @entity52 sanctions are already weighing on @entity6 authorities , finance minister @entity55 said friday in @entity59 that the government will have to pay more to borrow money , state news agency @entity54 said
@entity6 " will look at our oil and gas revenues
if the situation is like it is now , we will probably have to give up external borrowings and cut domestic ones , " @entity55 said
@entity0 : @entity4 speaking in one voice @entity59 has doggedly pursued its own course even as @entity52 leaders have denounced its actions as violations of @entity1 's sovereignty and a breach of international law
though @entity6 insists that its actions are legitimate , @entity1 's interim government has said @entity77 will never stop fighting for @entity8
@entity78 said in a statement friday that it has concluded that the international law of occupation applies to @entity6 forces in @entity8
" the occupying party is ultimately responsible for violations of international law committed by local authorities or proxy forces , " it said
while in @entity10 , @entity0 held talks with @entity90 president @entity89 and @entity92 chief @entity91
he said @entity6 's ratification of the treaty annexing @entity8 is less important than the @entity4 trade pact he has signed with @entity4 leaders
" frankly speaking , i do n't care about @entity6 signing this deal ; i care about @entity1 , @entity1 and our @entity12 future , " he said
" this deal covers more existential and most important issues , mainly security and defense cooperation
" @entity0 said the @entity4 would " speak in one single and strong voice " to protect its values and defend @entity1 's territorial integrity
@entity89 said the deal " shows our steadfast support for the course the people of @entity1 have courageously pursued
" @entity4 travel bans , asset freezes the @entity4 confirmed details of the sanctions against 12 @entity6 officials agreed to late thursday at the @entity118
those targeted with travel bans and asset freezes include @entity6 deputy prime minister @entity122 , as well as the chairwoman of the @entity6 upper house , @entity125 , and two @entity32 advisers
" sanctions are not a question of retaliation ; they are a foreign policy tool , " @entity89 said
" our goal is to stop @entity6 action against @entity1 , to restore @entity1 's sovereignty , and to achieve this , we need a negotiated solution
" he said the @entity4 expected soon to finalize approval of the remaining parts of the deal , particularly its economic provisions
@entity142 prime minister @entity141 said the @entity92 will draw up further sanctions -- in finance , military and energy -- for use if the situation escalates
" @entity12 is , i think , 25 % or so reliant on @entity6 gas , " he said
" but if you look at @entity152 's revenues , something like 50 % of them come from @entity12
so , you know , @entity6 needs @entity12 more than @entity12 needs @entity6
" @entity141 said the measures agreed to in @entity10 will carry a cost for @entity8 , whose goods would face heavy penalties and tariffs in @entity12 if they are shipped through @entity6 , not @entity1
@entity4 leaders want to see an international observer mission in @entity8 , preferably under the aegis of the @entity164 but , if not , sent by the @entity4 , @entity141 said
@entity165 : ' deeply concerned ' a day after speaking with @entity32 in @entity59 , @entity167 @entity166 ban ki - moon met friday in @entity77 with acting president @entity168 , then told reporters he was " very deeply concerned " by the tensions in parts of @entity1 and between @entity77 and @entity59
" these are some of the most traumatic and difficult times in the history of @entity1 , " he said
@entity165 urged a peaceful , diplomatic resolution to the crisis and said all parties should refrain from inflammatory actions and rhetoric
@entity167 assistant secretary - general for @entity78 @entity181 arrived friday in @entity8 for a two - day visit aimed at laying the groundwork for a @entity167 human rights monitoring mission , the @entity167 said
he and a team were to meet with @entity8 leaders , the head of the @entity190 minority and others , including the families of @entity1 servicemen , the @entity167 said
the @entity167 and other organizations stand ready to assist with the country 's elections , slated to be held may 25 , @entity165 said
while in @entity77 , he was also planning to meet with @entity0 and other ministers and lawmakers
in another sign of solidarity with @entity1 , @entity201 is offering to strengthen a @entity205 air - policing mission in the @entity207 area by sending four jets , a @entity200 spokesman said friday
the offer , accepted by the @entity210 , was extended friday as @entity201 defense minister @entity211 traveled to @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 , said @entity215 , the minister 's communication adviser
his trip followed a visit to the @entity210 this week by vice president @entity219
@entity32 's inner circle the @entity23 sanctions announced thursday target 20 people seen as close to @entity32 , as well as a bank , @entity225 , believed to serve the president and senior @entity6 officials
@entity32 rejected the putative link
" i personally did n't have an account there , but i 'll definitely open it on monday , " he said friday , according to the @entity229
the individuals named by the @entity233 include @entity32 allies in the @entity229 and in business
among the 16 government officials are @entity32 's chief of staff , @entity238 ; the speaker of the @entity47 , @entity240 ; and @entity241 , chairman of the @entity243 of the @entity6 @entity35 's upper house
four others were named as members of the government 's inner circle
they are financier @entity250 , labeled @entity32 's personal banker by a senior @entity23 administration official ; magnate @entity253 , whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to @entity32 , according to the @entity233 ; and businessmen @entity257 and @entity256
@entity259 aid in @entity259 , the @entity261 introduced a bill friday that provides aid to @entity1
" the @entity23 must stand with the people of @entity1 in the wake of @entity6 's attack on and occupation of @entity8 , " said ranking member @entity264 , @entity266 - @entity265 , in a statement
" it sends a clear message to president @entity32 and his corrupt cronies that we will not tolerate @entity6 aggression
" the @entity261 had passed a loan - guarantee bill and a non-binding resolution calling for sanctions , but friday 's legislation proposes statutory language to put those sanctions into law
president @entity285 is to meet next week with other leaders of the so - called @entity288 group of industrialized nations , on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in the @entity292
@entity6 has been excluded from the talks
@entity285 signed an executive order that authorizes further sanctions on key sectors of the @entity6 economy if @entity59 does not act to deescalate the situation
sanctions affect @entity6 markets @entity259 had already announced sanctions monday on 11 individuals ; the @entity4 had imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people
@entity307 foreign minister @entity306 told @entity309 's @entity308 that the new round of @entity23 sanctions would be " significantly more powerful than the first one
" the latest round " hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in @entity59 , " he said
" it will be noticed
" markets were down friday in @entity59 , amid uncertainty in the business community
the @entity320 , or @entity322 index , fell more than 2 % -- bringing its 2014 losses to 14 %
the ruble rebounded after falling early in the day ; it has lost about 10 % since the start of the year
in contrast , the markets and ruble had risen monday , when the first round of sanctions was announced and did not appear to target those in @entity32 's inner circle
the business community now appears to fear that @entity32 is on a collision course with the @entity52 , and that that could undermine its interests
@entity6 's @entity336 said friday that it had asked @entity32 to draft countermeasures in response to the expanded @entity52 sanctions
on thursday , @entity59 imposed measures against nine @entity23 officials and lawmakers , including @entity261 speaker @entity343 , senate majority leader @entity344 and sens. @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 and @entity348 , according to the @entity349
