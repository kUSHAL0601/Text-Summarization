@entity0 -- @entity3 's foreign ministry condemned @entity5 gov. @entity4 tuesday for saying that @entity3 was a " country that is being ruled by what many would perceive to be @entity8 terrorists
" @entity4 made the statement during a spirited debated between @entity11 presidential candidates in @entity12 monday night
most of @entity3 was fast asleep during the live broadcast , and @entity3 newspapers had already gone to print by the time @entity4 declared that @entity3 had moved " far away from the country i lived in back in the 1970s @entity17
that was our ally that worked with us , but today we do n't see that
" the @entity5 governor also argued that it was time for @entity23 to cut foreign aid to @entity25
a spokesman for @entity3 's foreign ministry fired back tuesday , accusing @entity4 of making " baseless and improper claims
" in a statement e-mailed to @entity1 , @entity28 said presidential candidates should " be more informed about the world and be more careful their statements
" " the unfortunate views of @entity4 are not shared in any case by @entity11 supporters , considering the weak support he has received in public polls and primary elections , " @entity28 concluded
@entity41 spokesman @entity40 said the @entity41 " absolutely and fundamentally " disagrees with @entity4 's statements
@entity3 is " @entity8 democracy in action , " @entity40 added , calling @entity25 a " stalwart ally " with which the @entity46 has a " strong partnership
" " i am disappointed and concerned that @entity3 and its time - tested ties of alliance , partnership and friendship with the @entity46 became the object of misplaced and ill - advised criticism during last night 's @entity11 candidates ' debate
needless to say , the @entity3 described in the debate simply does not exist , " @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity46 , @entity57 , said in a statement tuesday
he also rejected the idea that @entity3 receives significant sums of foreign aid from the @entity46
" indeed , @entity3 is a strong and growing trading partner with the @entity46 in general , and with @entity5 in particular , creating thousands of jobs throughout that state , " @entity57 added
top @entity3 government officials were unavailable for comment tuesday , with many of them in @entity70 for the funeral of veteran @entity3 @entity73 leader @entity72 , but the country 's largely - tabloid press wasted no time in responding to the comments on websites early tuesday morning
" the debate that the @entity11 candidate @entity4 attended on @entity46 @entity80 turned into a scandal that contained very ugly statements about @entity3 , " announced @entity84 state television
" @entity4 : what an idiot , " tweeted @entity85 , a columnist with the english - language @entity86
the @entity90 newspaper also posted a video on its website of @entity4 drawing a blank in the middle of a prior debate , forgetting in mid-sentence which was the third of three government departments he would cut if elected president
@entity4 's remarks came on the same day a @entity3 foreign ministry spokesman announced that a new @entity104 radar station , manned by @entity3 and @entity46 military personnel , went online this month in the @entity3 province of @entity107
the radar station is part of a controversial @entity46 - led missile defense shield that both @entity110 and @entity111 have publicly opposed
for more than 50 years , @entity3 has been the only @entity113 member of the @entity104 military alliance
@entity25 's relationship with @entity23 has been turbulent over the last decade , with sharp divisions emerging after the 2003 @entity46 - led invasion of @entity118
but that relationship has improved dramatically over the last several years
@entity3 has commanded the @entity104 mission in @entity121 four times over the last decade , and the @entity46 shares real - time intelligence from aerial drones for the @entity3 military 's ongoing war with rebels from the @entity128 , who operate along the mountainous border between @entity3 and @entity118 .
