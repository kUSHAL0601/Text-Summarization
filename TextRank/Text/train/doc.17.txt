-- @entity2 leader @entity1 has apparently released a new message to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks , in which he praises the @entity7 as a " devastating blow " to the @entity9
the hour - long video , posted monday on websites run by supporters of the terror network , includes an audio broadcast purportedly from @entity1 and a video message from @entity16 , recorded before his death in may
@entity1 's speech lauds the @entity7 as having " liberated thousands of the members of the @entity22 movement 's prisoners , who were imprisoned by direct orders from @entity9
" the uprising in a number of @entity26 nations , including @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , has also " liberated the @entity26 people from handcuffs of fear and terror , " the message says
the bin laden video is apparently the same footage that was released by the @entity9 government after @entity16 was killed in a raid by @entity9 forces in @entity41 , but this one includes the audio of the former @entity2 leader speaking
the version issued by the @entity46 , after it was found in @entity16 's @entity48 compound , was silent
the @entity49 cites @entity16 's message as warning @entity9 against " falling as slaves " to the control of major corporations and " jewish money capital
" in his message , @entity16 also recommends that @entity9 read the book " @entity57 " by @entity58 , saying that they should realize that @entity60 's government has not lived up to his campaign slogan , " yes we can
" at the time they released it , @entity9 officials said they believed the video , which was entitled " a message to the @entity67 " and had not been broadcast by @entity2 , was recorded in october or november last year
@entity0 's @entity68 contributed to this report .
