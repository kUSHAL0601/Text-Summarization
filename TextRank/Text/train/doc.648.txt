-- @entity2 artist @entity1 is no ordinary photographer
his " one - frame films " are eye - catching explosions of color , falling somewhere between cinema and photography
the influence of the big screen is obvious in @entity1 's photographs , which resemble stills from an ultra-stylish , slightly surreal movie shot in glorious @entity13
" the style of photography i have i call photomaking , " he told @entity0
" it 's influenced by cinema -- i call it one - frame filmmaking
" behind these photos , what you have is imagination at the beginning , then you have a script that i write , and then you have a cast and crew
we rehearse when needed and then we go and shoot
after that i do the post production
" completely self taught , @entity1 , 24 , only took up photography after returning to the @entity2 in 2006 , having been inspired by an experience he had while he was a student in @entity34
" i was just walking down @entity35 , a road known for its computers and electronics shops , and at some point i saw a trailer for " ' @entity41 : reloaded ' , " @entity1 told @entity0
" i was impressed and from that moment on i wanted to experiment and do those kinds of beautiful things
" stars shine at @entity47 @entity46 the oversaturated , vibrant colors in his work are the result of extensive post production , using @entity52
@entity1 is at home working in the digital medium having studied software engineering at university , and his dynamic style has won him work on advertising campaigns for @entity2 fashion labels
his work is also gaining recognition overseas , having been exhibited in @entity61 and featured on @entity64 - rapper @entity63 's blog
but @entity1 is keen not to limit himself to just one medium
describing himself as a " creative entrepreneur , " he has just published a book of images and text called " at the @entity71 , " and is looking for partners to help him branch out into fashion , perfume , and online computer games
but for now it 's his photographs that are grabbing people 's attention
more than just eye candy , @entity1 's images tell complex stories about @entity47
one striking photo shows two men using small bags of water to put out a blazing fire
it 's an image rich with symbolism
" it 's basically about the personal and collective struggle and the perseverance we show when we get towards a common greater good , " @entity1 told @entity0
" the fire can be understood as the problems in life
the small water bags can be the small means you have to get out of these problems
" so these youthful people you see are creative enough to use the small means they have to get out of the big problems they 're encountering
" it 's this kind of positive portrayal of @entity47 , free of cliches and stereotypes , that @entity1 says is central to his work
" you have great people everywhere , " he told @entity0
" i 've been very bent on showing positivity , happiness , hope , in ways that are not just flattering , but in ways that are real
