-- @entity2 's fiancé will not let her live down the fact that she chose a hotel for their weekend getaway from @entity7 , @entity8 , to @entity9 based on the teenage drama " @entity11
" @entity12 , a 26 - year - old public relations executive , watches the @entity14 show regularly
like many viewers this past season , she took notice when the show 's resident bad boy , @entity19 , opted to invest in some @entity9 real estate , the very real @entity22 on @entity24 's @entity23
" we walked into the lobby and my fiancé was like , ' oh , now i know why you wanted to stay here , even though this hotel is in a horrible neighborhood , ' " @entity12 recalled
it is women in their 20s and early 30s , like @entity12 , who have built a fan base for " @entity11 " and who are now driving traffic to the hotel across the street from @entity40
while hotels in @entity9 have been suffering over the past six months because of the nationwide recession and an increase in the supply of hotel rooms in the city , @entity22 has seen a 5 to 10 percent increase in bookings and a 50 percent increase in web site traffic since september
the marriage between property and television show began last summer when the production company called @entity55 , the president of hotels for @entity57 , which owns the @entity22 , and said it was looking for a hotel for location filming and also to include as a quasi-character on the show
" they were looking at three major competitors of ours at the time , " @entity55 said
" they finally picked us and i thought it was a great match for the hotel because we already catered to a young , affluent crowd in @entity9 with our rooftop lounge
" the show started filming quietly in the hotel 's rooms and lobby over the summer
the hotel made its tv debut at the start of the fall season when @entity19 began living and working out of the hotel
its bright red sign is featured prominently on the show
" my phone never stopped ringing from folks in the industry asking ' really ? ' " @entity55 said
" but i thought it was a great idea
i watched as a woman around 17 years old came to stay at the hotel with her mother
she did n't realize that the show would be filming and she nearly hyperventilated right there in the lobby
" it is girls like that and women like @entity12 who are driving traffic to the hotel these days
that is an invaluable asset as tourist traffic is up and business travel is down
" i think that teenagers can dictate where their parents stay over vacation and we saw a lot of that over the @entity109 holiday and into the bookings for @entity111 and @entity112 's , " @entity55 said
@entity113 manages the front desk and concierge service for the @entity116 and said there is no shortage of guest questions about the show during the room booking process
" the standard questions we get are about how often the cast shoots and when they will be back
a lot of people call just wanting to know if they really shoot here in the hotel or whether they just use the name , and i have to tell them that yes , they really do shoot on location here , " @entity125 said
on site , most of the questions @entity125 and her staff are asked do n't come from starstruck teenagers
they come from women @entity12 's age
" the questions here come from girls in their 20s and 30s
they want to know if @entity19 is really as cute as he is on the show and if the girls are actually skinny in person , " @entity125 said
when the show 's stars , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , are at the hotel filming , it is n't unusual for crowds of around 400 people to gather outside the hotel 's entrance on @entity162
the @entity116 's boom comes amid an overall decrease in occupancy for hotel rooms throughout the rest of @entity9
@entity168 , a senior vice president with @entity169 , a consulting hotel advisory firm , reviews hotel numbers every day
he noticed an uptick in the @entity116 's numbers recently but had not thought to attribute it to the hotel 's guest appearance in a television show
@entity168 said the rest of @entity9 's hotels are just starting to put the dark days behind them
compared to the @entity116 's increased sales , occupancy for the city as a whole has been at 81 percent , down 5 points from 86 percent last year
additionally , room rates have been down , decreasing by around $ 70 last year
the change , @entity168 said , comes from the replacement of business travelers to the city with the kind of tourists who are flocking to the @entity116
" you can compare it to what ' @entity197 ' did for the shoes [ of ] @entity200 , " said branding expert @entity192 of the @entity194
" it increases the awareness of the hotel to a national audience and people who are loyal viewers of the show will want to experience in their lives what they see the characters experiencing
plus people who are new to @entity9 will already feel like they know the hotel and that is comforting for out - of - town travelers
" the hotel 's staff has been enjoying capitalizing on its newfound fame
they hired cocktail consultant @entity217 to concoct a menu of " @entity11 " - themed cocktails for the property 's rooftop bar and lounge , including the " i 'm @entity19 , " a mix of @entity225 and apple cider that the menu promises will start out sweet and turn sour , much like the character played by @entity156 .
