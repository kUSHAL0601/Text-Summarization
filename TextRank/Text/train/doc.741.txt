now , the alleged assailants are facing the consequences
three teenagers appeared in a juvenile court tuesday in @entity13 , @entity14
they were charged with aggravated battery

" that may not mean anything to you , but that 's a way of telling you this is an extremely serious charge , " the judge said
opinion : in teen beating , do n't blame bus driver father promises ' consequences ' as they left the courtroom , the three 15 - year - olds stayed silent when asked if they had any words for the victim
the father of one of the accused offered a few brief words : " consequences , just consequences is all i can say
" prosecutors say the older boys were seeking revenge after the 13 - year - old told teachers that they tried to sell him drugs
the juvenile justice department is recommending nine months probation and anger management for two of the accused
the third , the alleged ring leader , is facing an additional robbery charge for allegedly stealing money from the victim after the beating
opinion : why i would n't break up a school fight call for tougher punishment the prosecution asked to enter the bus surveillance video as evidence to support its argument that the juvenile justice department 's proposed punishments do n't match the severity of the crime
