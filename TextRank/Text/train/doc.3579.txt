@entity0 , @entity1 -- two children sued @entity4 and three government agencies friday over the loss of their father aboard missing @entity8
@entity9 , 13 , and @entity10 , 11 , named the airline , officials at @entity1 's civil aviation and immigration agencies , and the country 's air force chief as responsible for the loss of the jet , which disappeared on march 8
their father , @entity19 , 41 , was on board the flight bound for @entity22 from @entity23
it lost contact with air traffic control over the sea between @entity1 and @entity28
missing for 237 days now , @entity8 carried 239 people , including 12 crew members
@entity1 , @entity31 and @entity32 are conducting a deep - sea search for the aircraft in the southern @entity35 , where authorities say they believe it ended up
in the suit , the claimants say the airline breached the agreement with their father for a safe passage when it failed to land in @entity22
the claimants say that air traffic control failed to take sufficient measures to establish contact or to launch a search for @entity8 within a reasonable time after it had lost contact with the @entity50
the boys , who filed the suit through their mother , @entity53 , said the immigration agency had failed to vet passengers properly , resulting in some people with fake identification boarding the flight
two @entity59 with forged @entity61 and @entity62 passports were on the flight , according to authorities
against the air force chief , the claimants allege that the @entity1 air force failed or neglected to investigate an unscheduled flight , presumed to be @entity8 , after detecting it
the government of @entity1 was named , as it is the employer and principal of the agencies named in the lawsuit
civil aviation director @entity74 said he found out about the lawsuit from news websites
" we just read this from the news websites and have not received anything official yet , " he said
@entity2 's attempts to reach other agencies named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful
the claimants are suing for loss of support from their father , who operated an internet - based business .
