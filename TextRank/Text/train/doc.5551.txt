@entity0 -- it may not have been the most dramatic of moments , but it was certainly an important one : two women , modestly dressed and veiled , walked proudly alongside the flag of their nation @entity6 into @entity0 's @entity7 at the @entity9 ' spectacular opening ceremony
this understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the @entity13 itself , as the first occasion in the history of the @entity9 when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams
the achievement was welcomed by those at the highest echelons of sport , with @entity23 , head of the @entity24 , noting with pride in his speech at the opening ceremony that it was " a major boost for gender equality
" women have been the center of attention throughout much of the @entity13 , both within and without @entity9 venues , as they broke records , sparked drama , impressed with immense skill and poise and won medal after medal
indeed , for many , @entity0 2012 has truly been " the women 's games
" for hosts @entity43 , the undoubted superstar was @entity46 , a heptathlete of remarkable talent and composure who snatched gold despite immense pressure and the unforgiving lens of modern celebrity
her comfortable win in the toughest of contests , and her vow to " keep exactly the same and the way i am " , sparked national praise and a call from women 's activists for more positive role models like her
scores of other , lesser - known women athletes marked firsts for their countries
@entity69 's @entity68 became her country 's first woman to win a medal in the games , saying afterward her medal was " for all the @entity69 people , for @entity69 women , for the new @entity69 "
games leave @entity0 with a golden glow women boxers made history by being included in the games for the first time , and the @entity84 's gymnastics team won a brace of medals for their remarkable performance
on the drama side , @entity89 fencer @entity88 found herself at the center of one of the most extraordinary moments of the games after the dying second of one match granted her rival the gold
the sight of her in floods of tears , refusing to leave the venue moved many , even if @entity13 authorities were unimpressed
but this is not to say there has not been controversy , in terms of sport , and plain , old fashioned sexism
eight women badminton players from @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity89 were disqualified for trying deliberately to lose matches in order to secure easier games
controversy over the disparate treatment of male and female athletes arose when it was revealed that both @entity123 and @entity124 had made their women 's football teams fly coach while their male colleagues enjoyed the luxury -- and extra leg room -- of business class
the incident prompted the embarrassed @entity124 authorities to announce they were reviewing their policies but led to accusations of inequality
@entity84 coverage of their " @entity140 " gymnastics team 's heroine , @entity138 , turned into a discussion of the @entity144 's hair , angering many who felt it denigrated her stunning achievement by playing into racial stereotypes
golden girl @entity150 : i 'd do it for nothing and the age - old double standard of looks versus talent came into play when @entity159 weightlifter @entity158 was forced to endure cruel taunts on @entity161 and other social media about her appearance
her response was to handle it with aplomb , writing on her blog : " we do n't lift weights in order to look hot , especially for the likes of men like that
" but the comments -- and the ease with which they were made on online platforms -- gave pause for thought
despite such media storms , overall many sensed a shift in the right direction , a sea change in attitudes towards women in competitive sports
in women 's football , @entity188 's victory over @entity189 at @entity190 in front of 70,000 screaming fans , many of them young children who will provide the next generation of olympians , was a zeitgeist moment for women 's football
after the game , the sight of buggies piled up outside the arena , patiently awaiting their tiny cargo , was a small , but potent sign of change
the @entity84 and @entity207 women 's football teams fought a remarkable battle to reach the semi finals , with the @entity84 eventually prevailing 4 - 3 thanks to a goal in the dying seconds of the game and prompting praise from pundits as one of the most thrilling matches played by either gender in the @entity13
as for those @entity6 women athletes , they failed , as expected , to win an @entity13 medal , but perhaps winning just was n't the point
judo player @entity221 finally competed after a row over her headscarf ended in compromise with @entity13 authorities
despite the furor , she , too , sensed that a breakthrough had been made
" unfortunately , we did not win a medal , but in the future we will and i will be a star for women 's participation , " she said
" it was the opportunity of a lifetime
