-- millions of @entity1 have been shocked by the devastation caused by the tornadoes in @entity4
having toured the area , it 's impossible to put the scope of the damage in words
not just homes but entire neighborhoods are gone
@entity1 also may have been surprised to hear about a disagreement in @entity13 about delivering disaster aid to victims
the good news is this disagreement does n't exist
no one in @entity13 is opposing delivering aid to victims
in fact , there is no aid bill for @entity4 to even debate
the @entity24 has $ 11.6 billion available in the fund for assistance to victims in all federally declared disasters , and this is likely more than sufficient to help victims in @entity4
as the ranking member of the @entity33 committee that oversees @entity24 , i 'm confident @entity4 will receive the assistance it needs
the bad news is some in the media have persisted in reporting on this nonexistent funding fight -- although it might happen in the future if @entity24 runs out of money
my view is that focusing on funding questions now is premature and insensitive
although i 've never been shy about telling reporters and my constituents where i stand on tough questions , focusing on a fight that is n't happening is crass and irresponsible journalism
instead of reporting the facts about disaster spending , many news outlets have used the tragedy to talk about " dilemmas , " " binds " and " divisions " among @entity53
at this point , these stories are only figments in the imaginations of a few journalists and editors who are having a difficult time keeping their opinions to themselves
case in point is wednesday 's @entity65 story , where i learned about my alleged dilemma on tornado aid
but @entity68 buried the real news in the 15th paragraph , which reads : " at this point , all these questions are theoretical
there is no @entity4 disaster relief bill
there may never be one
... at the moment , the @entity24 has a large stockpile of funds to pay for disaster response ; members of @entity80 estimated it at $ 11.6 billion
" the article goes on to say that most legislators agree that the fund is adequate to handle the @entity4 disaster , and it quotes senate majority leader @entity85 as saying " right now , we do n't need the money
" in other words , the real news is no @entity4 disaster relief bill exists and , as @entity85 says , " we do n't need the money
" still , i have no objection to stating unequivocally that if @entity24 runs out of money , i will encourage my colleagues to pay for any new assistance for @entity4 , or anywhere else by reducing lower - priority spending rather than borrowing new money
let me explain why this principle is important
under congressional budget rules , if disaster funds are exhausted , @entity80 can pass an " emergency supplemental spending " bill that does not count against that year 's budget caps
in other words , @entity80 can simply borrow new money without setting priorities or making hard choices about where to cut the budget elsewhere
at a time when we 're losing $ 200 billion a year because of waste and duplication , not setting priorities does n't make sense in any circumstance
why respond to one disaster by creating another one for taxpayers ? some have suggested it is hypocritical for me to support disaster aid in my state after opposing the @entity126 emergency aid bill for the @entity127
but my position has been the same for my entire service in @entity80 , starting when i pushed for offsets to the @entity131 bombing supplemental bill in 1995
my position has never been to oppose all forms of disaster aid
my position has been to oppose politicians who use disasters to spend money that has nothing to do with helping victims of disasters
the hard truth is both parties have abused the emergency spending process in @entity80 for many years
for instance , when the @entity145 was ravaged by @entity146 in 2005 , many in @entity13 were appalled by my suggestion that times of tragedy and disaster are precisely the times for politicians to tighten their belts and make hard choices
one of the sacrifices i proposed was to divert funds from a $ 223 million bridge in @entity157 -- known as the " @entity158 " -- to a bridge over @entity160 in @entity161 that was damaged by @entity146
my colleagues fumed : how dare i force such choices ? my response was -- and is : how dare we not force such choices ? the @entity126 package , unfortunately , is another recent example
i supported a scaled - down $ 25 billion version of disaster aid for @entity126 , but i strongly opposed a $ 50 billion package that was an all - you - can - eat buffet for politicians and politically connected contractors
much of the larger @entity126 package had little to do with helping victims of the disaster
more than $ 5 billion was directed to the @entity177 -- more than the @entity177 ' annual budget
even @entity179 was in on the game
@entity179 said its damage from the storm was minimal , but @entity80 wanted to give it $ 15 million anyway
the most revealing aspect was more than 70 % of the $ 50 billion would not be spent for two years , which meant it was an economic stimulus package , not a disaster aid bill
i do n't believe anyone in the @entity33 wants or anticipates a @entity189 - like fight about emergency spending offsets for @entity4
still , if any politicians in @entity13 hope to use @entity4 's tragedy as vehicle for pork , do n't bother
state rep. @entity195 from @entity196 , @entity4 , put it best this week on @entity198 : " we do n't want anything
we do n't want anything extra
we just want to rebuild our city
and whatever they can do for us they can cough up , and whatever they do n't , we`ll make it up
that`s the way we roll here
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity210 .
