-- audiences will be getting a new look at @entity3 this weekend with the wide release of director @entity5 's " @entity3 , " and they 'll be seeing a lot of @entity7 , too
the film , which recreates the former president 's life through the crucible of the @entity12 , was filmed at several historic locations
@entity3 's life took him through a number of states before and during the war , which gave @entity5 and his crew a wide geographic canvas
it was while shooting " @entity24 " in @entity21 , @entity22 , that @entity5 began discussing returning to the state , said @entity25 , interim director of the @entity26
@entity25 worked with production designer @entity27 for nine years , helping him scout locations across the state
yet there is so much more to @entity3 than the movie that bears his name
for history and film buffs looking to explore @entity3 's life , here are five locales that go beyond a trek to the @entity37
do n't watch these 11 movies on a plane @entity40 : @entity41 , @entity22 one of @entity5 's @entity22 stops was @entity40 , now @entity41 , which served as @entity43 's headquarters during the @entity44
@entity3 spent two weeks there in 1865 with his family , traveling aboard the war ship @entity48 , which filmmakers replicated in full , said @entity50 , chief executive officer of the @entity51
from there , @entity3 watched the fall of @entity54 , later visiting the city , which was also shot on location , @entity25 said
indeed , many pivotal wartime decisions " were made on @entity22 soil , " @entity50 said
tailing @entity59 : 007 destinations @entity62 : @entity63 , @entity22 filming in @entity63 was a win - win for both the state and the filmmakers : @entity5 dressed up @entity63 's capitol building as its national counterpart , and he used the capitol square as a sort of backlot for more than two weeks , @entity25 said
tourism officials , in turn , organized city tours , turning the location shoots into opportunity
while filming , locals consumed the star sightings
a local restaurant even debuted a salad named after one of the movie 's stars : the @entity81 of @entity84
did co-star @entity85 really eat at @entity86 ? yes , and fans can too , @entity50 said
with any luck , they 'll sit in his seat
@entity91 and @entity92 : @entity93 , @entity94 @entity93 , @entity94 , was the nucleus of @entity3 's career , political and otherwise , before he headed to @entity97
it was there in 1858 that he gave his " @entity100 " speech
it 's also home to the @entity91 , where @entity3 worked as a legislator , and to the @entity103
both sites are crucial , according to @entity105 , public information officer at the @entity106 , the former because " it looks as though the @entity108 just met there yesterday rather than 150 years ago
" adding to the historical sense visitors get while touring , it feels now as it felt then
but @entity3 was also a lawyer for 25 years , " longer than anything else in his life , " @entity105 said
the law offices -- the only of their kind , as no other buildings remain where @entity3 practiced law -- provide a necessary perspective on the president 's professional experiences
new @entity123 : @entity54 , @entity94 @entity3 spent some of his most formative years growing up in @entity125 , @entity105 said
and the township is at the heart of the " log cabin " image that has crystallized around the 16th president
the site was recreated in the 1930s and ' 40s using the remaining foundations
" you can stroll through the log village and try and imagine what life would have been like in the 1830s , " @entity105 said , which lets visitors experience a period when @entity3 transformed himself from a " young man with no real direction in life " to someone with " purpose and a vision
" @entity3 birthplace : @entity148 , @entity149 the president 's birthplace is " literally the first memorial of any kind of @entity3 , " said @entity154 , superintendent of the @entity155 , which has its origins in an early 20th - century project by the @entity158
the park , designed by @entity160 years before he began work on the @entity162 , includes two sites : the @entity164 , which stands on the farm where @entity3 was born in 1809 , and his boyhood home at @entity167
it was at his boyhood home that @entity170 formed his earliest memories , @entity154 said , such as planting pumpkin seeds between the farm 's corn rows
at @entity167 , visitors get a more hands - on idea of what those early years were like : the field is " pretty much unchanged , " @entity154 said
a favorite activity of his at the park is visiting the creek
" the best thing to my mind , it gives me goose bumps when we go over there , is to stand there , " he said , " and look down on the field and contemplate that you 're pretty much looking at what @entity3 saw
