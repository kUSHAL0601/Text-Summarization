-- @entity2 striker @entity1 has been ruled out of a return to his former club @entity4 when the group stage of the @entity6 kicks off on tuesday
the @entity7 international , who spent just one season in @entity11 following his big - money move from @entity2 's city rivals @entity13 in 2009 , suffered a thigh injury in training on monday
" the tests carried out showed that the player has a strain in his thigh muscle and will not be leaving for @entity4 with the rest of the squad
he will rest for a few days and then start his treatment towards the end of the week , " the @entity24 club 's website reported
@entity1 's absence could mean a reprieve for @entity31 international @entity30 , who was expected to make way for @entity34 star @entity33 despite scoring in the club 's @entity36 opener on friday
@entity1 also netted in that game , a 2 - 2 draw with @entity40
@entity2 fight back to draw with @entity40 @entity4 midfielder @entity41 said he was disappointed that his former teammate would not be lining up at the @entity43 against the tournament 's defending champions
" it 's a pity that he ca n't play -- he 's a great player and you always want to play against good players
he really wanted to come and play , and it 's a shame he ca n't make it
however , i do n't think that takes anything away from the game , which should be fantastic , " @entity41 told reporters at a pre-match press conference
@entity41 will renew his rivalry with @entity2 's @entity59 midfielder @entity58 , with whom he clashed during the 2010 @entity61 final
" it 's true that during the final there was some rough play , but i prefer to think there was no malicious intent
he 's an opponent , but above all we are professional companions and i respect him in all respects , " said @entity41 , who scored the only goal of the match in @entity69 in extra-time
@entity4 coach @entity74 is expected to recall two - time world player of the year @entity75 , who was rested for saturday 's shock 2 - 2 draw with @entity78
the @entity80 forward will make his first competitive outing against the seven - time @entity83 champions , as he bids to be the competition 's top scorer for the fourth season in a row
@entity4 will be without new signing @entity88 , with the @entity91 midfielder expected to be sidelined for two months after tearing a thigh muscle against @entity78 as the @entity94 team dropped their first points of the @entity97 season

@entity107 's build - up has been marred by a controversy over $ 80 million striker @entity119 , who supposedly criticized " older " teammates in an interview with @entity11 's @entity97 website which was translated to @entity108 on his personal internet page
" we are going in - depth to regain the tape of that interview
we 'll see if things play exactly as they are in that interview , " said the @entity130 team 's manager @entity128
