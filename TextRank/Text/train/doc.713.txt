@entity0 , @entity1 -- federal prosecutors and the @entity4 have opened an investigation into the killing of an unarmed teen by a neighborhood watch volunteer in @entity1
the death drew protesters monday to the courthouse in @entity12 , north of @entity13 , to demand justice for @entity15 , the 17 - year - old who was shot and killed last month while walking back to his father 's fiancee 's house in @entity0
the @entity22 - @entity21 teen 's parents said monday that they believed race was a factor in their son 's death , and the @entity27 had called for a federal investigation , saying local police have shown " blatant disregard for justice
" late monday , the @entity31 said it would dispatch officials to @entity0 to investigate and " to address tension in the community
" " the department will conduct a thorough and independent review of all of the evidence and take appropriate action at the conclusion of the investigation , " @entity31 spokeswoman @entity35 said in a written statement
" the department also is providing assistance to and cooperating with the state officials in their investigation into the incident
" @entity1 gov. @entity48 also weighed in monday evening , noting that the case has " caused significant concern within the @entity0 community and the state " and asking the @entity53 to provide " any assistance necessary " to local investigators
the man who shot @entity15 , @entity56 , has not been charged
he told police he shot the teen in self - defense , and police say they have no evidence to refute his story
@entity15 's father , @entity63 , told @entity2 's " @entity68 " that his son 's death was " a matter of profiling
" " i think that 's an issue that mr. @entity56 himself considers as someone suspicious -- a black kid with a hoodie on , jeans , tennis shoes , " @entity15 said
" thousands of people wear that outfit every day , so what was so suspicious about @entity15 that @entity56 felt as though he had to confront him ? " and the slain teen 's mother told @entity80 's " today " show that the neighborhood watch captain " was out there reacting to the color of his skin
" " my son was n't doing anything but walking on the sidewalk , and i just do n't understand why this situation got out of control , " @entity86 said
@entity2 has made numerous attempts to contact @entity56 , who is @entity93 , but have been unsuccessful
in a statement to the @entity96 , his father says @entity56 grew up in a multiracial family and has moved out of his home after receiving death threats
and in announcing the federal probe , @entity35 cautioned that bringing a civil rights case requires the government prove " that a person acted intentionally and with the specific intent to do something which the law forbids -- the highest level of intent in criminal law
" at the @entity12 courthouse , a handful of student protesters and a law professor from @entity113 met with a representative of the state attorney 's office to discuss the ongoing investigation while protesters demanded @entity56 's arrest
many carried signs in remembrance of @entity15
" gone but not forgotten , " read one that had a picture of the young man wearing a football uniform
" no justice for @entity15
no peace for @entity0 ! " read another
assistant state attorney @entity131 told the students it would take several weeks to look at the case , but that the " investigation of the @entity0 police needs to be greatly supplemented , " @entity130 , the @entity113 professor , said after the meeting
the state attorney 's office also said a voice analysis would be conducted on 911 calls from the night of the shooting to determine who was yelling for help , students said
@entity56 , 28 , called police around nightfall on february 26 to report a suspicious man in his neighborhood
" something 's wrong with him
he 's coming to check me out , " @entity56 told a police dispatcher in a 911 call released monday
" he 's got something in his hands
i do n't know what his deal is
" the teen started to run , @entity56 reported
when he said he was following , the dispatcher told him , " we do n't need you to do that
" shortly afterward , neighbors began calling 911 to report a fight , then a gunshot
by the time police arrived , @entity15 lay dead
he was carrying a bag of @entity170 and an iced tea that he had purchased at a nearby convenience store , and was headed back to his father 's fiancee 's home
@entity15 said he 's " positive " that his son 's voice that can be heard screaming for help in the neighbors ' calls
" it 's heartwrenching , because those actually were my son 's last words , " he said
" and to hear his last words being cries of help , is devastating
it tears me apart as a father
" @entity2 's @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .
