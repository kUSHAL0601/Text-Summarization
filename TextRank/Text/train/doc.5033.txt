-- two very different images captivated @entity3 viewers on wednesday
first , a @entity7 video of an eagle snatching up a toddler captivated millions of viewers , some of whom may not have immediately realized it was fake
uploaded on tuesday , the clip shows a golden eagle swooping out of the sky to grab an infant in its talons , then dropping the child seconds later
despite broad and immediate skepticism of its authenticity , it had more than 5 million views by wednesday evening
the @entity23 digital - media school where the video was created issued a statement wednesday afternoon clarifying the clip as a hoax and naming the students involved
however the school , @entity29 , was unapologetic about its prank , even pointing viewers to another hoax video , created by students , of an unlikely penguin escape
( the penguin video had a paltry 37,000 views
) comments on @entity7 and the school 's website were mixed
@entity40 wrote , " ... it would be a good idea to post some links to raptor rescue centres
this video will undoubtedly spawn irrational fear of eagles and others
" a @entity7 commenter , @entity50 , had a more light - hearted view : " @entity53 » ¿ @entity52
" considering that the bald eagle is a national symbol of @entity57 , maybe it 's fitting that the day 's other viral imagery involved president @entity59
@entity61 's website published a behind - the - scenes gallery of photos of @entity59 , snapped by @entity65 photographer @entity64 , to accompany the magazine naming @entity59 its @entity67
one of them showed @entity59 at the @entity65 , pretending to be caught in a pint - sized @entity70 's web
although @entity61 's choice of @entity59 over @entity74 schoolgirl activist @entity73 was controversial to some , @entity71 was immediately captivated by the @entity70 image
@entity59 posted the photo wednesday morning on his @entity71 account , and by the evening it had been retweeted more than 9,200 times
@ michael_lobster tweeted , " i really hope that this is the plot of the new @entity70 movie
" the tone on @entity83 was decidedly less enthusiastic
" am i the only one who is skeptical of all these cute kid picture situations the president seems to find himself in ? authentic or staged ? " wrote @entity87
" i do n't know about politics , but i can tell you one thing , " wrote @entity88 on the social platform @entity89
" i want to be the kind of father @entity59 is , and treat all kids this well
" " the photo , " wrote @entity102 , " does a better job of cementing the correctness of @entity61 's selection than any 10,000 - word profile can
" @entity0 's @entity103 contributed to this story .
