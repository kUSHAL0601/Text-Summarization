-- lawmakers in @entity2 have approved a gender identity law that allows individuals to be recognized in official documents by the gender they choose
@entity2 have the right to be treated in accordance with their own gender identity , and the government is required to recognize it as well , the law states
the law gained final approval from the @entity15 on wednesday
" it is understood that gender identity is the internal and individual way that a person experiences their gender , which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth , " the law states
this means that people 18 or older in @entity2 can go to a government office and change the gender listed on official documents if they choose
the law is meant to include people who undergo sex change operations or hormone treatments to look like the opposite sex , but it goes further than that
those who dress , talk or have manners like someone of the opposite sex also qualify to have their documents changed to recognize their self - identity
a push for such a law began under the late president @entity44 , and the cause was taken up by his wife and presidential successor , @entity48
" ( the law ) is a path toward equality , inclusion and recognition of rights for all @entity2 , " vice president @entity49 said
" today is a day when thousands and thousands of @entity2 have new rights , without anyone else losing an ounce of their own rights
