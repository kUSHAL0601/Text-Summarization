@entity0 -- a bizarre mountain retreat built on top of a 26 - floor @entity0 residential building faces demolition after complaints by residents
the rooftop structure is covered by fake rocks , trees and bushes , and can be clearly seen from one of @entity0 's busiest commuter roads in one of the city 's more upmarket areas
a @entity1 crew who visited the building on tuesday saw an official government order stuck to the door giving the owner 15 days to demolish 800 square meters of the structure that have been deemed illegal
no one answered when they knocked
locals say the unusual high - rise retreat has been slowly taking over the rooftop for years -- construction is said to have started in 2007 -- but is only now receiving attention after images of the unlikely extension went viral on social media
@entity34 's tallest building bring @entity35 to its knees ? " a lot of people have moved out from the top floors
they sold their apartments and got out , " said @entity41 , who lives in an apartment on the 25th floor -- one floor below the construction
the owner of the rocky outcrop has been identified as professor @entity50 , a doctor of traditional @entity35 medicine who owns a national chain of acupuncture clinics , and is a former member of a district @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , according to the @entity58
" i used to worry that the house might be too much but i never expected this much attention , " @entity41 is reported to have told the @entity59
his neighbor , @entity41 , said residents had complained many times to officials , but nothing was done to stop construction
@entity35 bans building projects to curb @entity70 excesses " it 's very noisy and they are always bringing rocks and things up the elevator , " she said
" it 's definitely not safe
with all those boulders up there , what would happen if there was an earthquake ? " other residents claimed the retreat had caused cracks in their walls which leak when it rains
@entity1 spoke to a number of people on the street who sympathized with @entity41 's neighbors and suggested the professor was allowed to build with impunity because of his links to influential officials
" it 's obvious he is powerful , there 's no way he could do illegal building like that without knowing people , " one said
another added , " if i had that kind of money , i would do it too
" " it does n't just take money , " @entity41 said
" even with money , but no connections , you would n't be allowed to build things like this
" @entity41 is reported to have said he would demolish the villa if requested
