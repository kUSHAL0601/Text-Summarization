-- @entity1 has candy , the @entity4 sisters have fashion interests and @entity6 has underwear
now , world no. 3 @entity8 has joined the ranks of tennis superstars looking beyond the court to expand their multi-million dollar fortunes
the 2012 @entity15 champion may have racked up over $ 26 million in prize money during a glittering tennis career , but the @entity18 is hoping to swell his coffers further after acquiring the @entity20 near his hometown of @entity22 in @entity23
@entity8 , a winner of 25 career @entity24 world tour titles , plans to turn the @entity26 into a 15 - room five - star hotel set to open in 2014
that opening date will allow the hotel to potentially welcome golf fans attending the @entity31 at the nearby @entity32 course next year
the project will also provide a boost to the local economy , creating 40 new jobs and providing revenue for other businesses in the area
" i am pleased to have acquired @entity20 and look forward to securing its future as a successful business , " the 25 - year - old @entity8 said in a statement
" by re-establishing @entity45 as a leading luxury hotel at the heart of the @entity22 community we will be able to attract new visitors to the area , create a number of new jobs and focus on supporting other local businesses
" i 'm pleased to be able to give something back to the community i grew up in
" @entity20 is set in 50 acres of woodland and has its very own trout loch
the hotel has special meaning to the @entity8 family , with @entity8 's older brother @entity60 , also a professional tennis player , marrying his @entity62 wife @entity61 there in 2010
the day - to - day running of the hotel will be handled by @entity64 ( @entity65 ) , who look after eight other properties in @entity23
" we are delighted to be working with @entity8 in this very exciting project to redevelop and run @entity20 , " said @entity65 's managing director @entity68
" our team of experts has experience in every aspect of the hospitality industry and specialise in working with independent properties and transforming them into luxurious destinations
" i am confident that , with @entity8 , we can create a very special hotel in his home community
" while we aim to create a destination that attracts visitors from around the world we are also determined to ensure it remains a venue of choice for local people
