-- skier @entity1 is to take a sabbatical from @entity4 competition , but the @entity5 insists the break has nothing to do with her recent admission she suffers from depression
last month the finest female skier of her generation had to spend a couple of days in hospital due to an intestinal infection that she said had affected her " energy and strength "
" after talking with my family and consulting with my coaches and trainers , i 've decided to take a break from the @entity4 circuit , " said @entity17 on her @entity19 page
" i believe that some time off the mountain will help me regain the physical strength that i require to compete at the level that i demand from myself
i look forward to getting back on the mountain in the @entity30
" @entity31 of the @entity33 @entity32 added : " we support @entity1 in the decision so that she can return to the @entity4 and compete in the @entity36 at full strength
" this season @entity17 has won two downhills and two super-gs , with her @entity41 victory in @entity42 delivering a 57th career @entity4 triumph to put her within five victories of record - holder @entity46 on the all - time list
but the @entity5 was below her best in the weekend races at @entity51 when her bid for a fifth - straight win ended in a crash
" i want to be emphatic that this has nothing to do with my recent interview with @entity63 , " added the 28 - year - old @entity17 on @entity19 , referring to her admission that she has suffered from depression and currently takes an anti-depressant to manage the condition
" i had completed that interview weeks before i was in the hospital with the intestinal infection
" in the magazine interview , @entity17 revealed that she had hit a low point four years ago
" i could n't get out of bed anymore
i felt hopeless , empty , like a zombie , " said @entity17 , who added : " all the parts of my life are finally in sync
i accept who i am , and i 'm moving forward
" last week @entity17 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview that was pondering taking legal action in her bid to race against the men after the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) blocked her bid to challenge the sport 's top male stars at a recent meeting in @entity87
" i do n't want to make a big stink out of it but i feel like their response that i ca n't race with the men simply because i 'm a woman was definitely gender - biased so i 'm going to do what i can and hopefully make something work
" so right now i 'm looking into options -- my father is an attorney so i 'm just seeing if there 's any options , legally , that i can take
