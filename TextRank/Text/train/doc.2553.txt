a man armed with what police say was an assault rifle and carrying materials expressing anti-government sentiment opened fire friday morning at @entity8 , killing one person before being chased down himself , authorities said
eyewitnesses said the suspect asked people , " hey , are you @entity14 ? " -- the acronym for the @entity14 -- according to a federal law enforcement official
if they said " no , " he would move on
one of those questioned travelers was @entity18
he told @entity20 's @entity19 that the same man he 'd just seen shoot a @entity14 officer " calmly " walked toward him and asked , " @entity14 ? " " i just shook my head , " @entity18 said
" and he kept going
" in the aftermath of the shooting , investigators found information on the suspect expressing not just anti-federal government sentiment but also anger at the @entity14 specifically , according to the federal law enforcement official
by then , a @entity14 officer was dead -- the first employee of that relatively new agency to be killed in the line of duty
the agency identified him as @entity36 , who would have turned 40 next week
he was working as a travel document checker at the time of the shooting , according to @entity14 workers ' union and federal sources
two additional @entity14 officers were also shot , one in the leg , authorities said
the suspected gunman himself was detained after being shot in the chest multiple times , according to an intelligence source briefed by @entity8 police
as of friday evening , he was receiving medical attention at a hospital , according to @entity53 special agent in charge @entity54
he was identified later by the @entity53 as @entity56 , a 23 - year - old from @entity8
he graduated in 2008 from @entity57 , an all - boys catholic school in @entity58 , @entity59 , according to school president @entity60
the intelligence source said @entity56 's family became concerned in recent days after he sent his brother and father " angry , rambling " texts venting about the government , living in @entity8 and his unhappiness generally
@entity68 said that it received three male victims -- one in critical condition and two in fair condition
one of the two in fair condition suffered gunshot wounds , while another had an unspecified injury , said dr. @entity77 , an emergency physician at the @entity8 hospital
one of them was released by friday afternoon ; one of the others who remained at the hospital was @entity56 , according to the intelligence source
two patients , meanwhile , were transported to @entity84 in @entity85 , said @entity86 , a trauma surgeon there
one was what @entity86 described as a " middle - aged " person with minor injuries from being shot in the shoulder
the other had no signs of life when he arrived at the hospital , the surgeon added
it was n't known if this person was the slain @entity14 officer
@entity14 : number of guns discovered in airports rising the episode caused what airport police chief @entity105 , who had said the shooter used an " assault rifle , " described as a " large amount of chaos
" people ran for their lives and took shelter wherever they could as authorities pursued the gunman
@entity115 was among those in the busy airport when he heard two " loud pops
" " then i heard this mad rush of people , and there was a stampede of people coming from this direction , " @entity115 told @entity20
" nobody really knew what was going on
" still , by friday afternoon , authorities believes the worst was over
@entity105 noted it is believed there was only one shooter
suspect ' pulled an assault rifle out ... and began to open fire ' an otherwise normal day in the airport 's @entity133 turned upside down around 9:20 a.m. ( 12:20 p.m. et ) , as the suspect approached a checkpoint
there , he " pulled an assault rifle out of a bag and began to open fire , " @entity105 said
@entity139 had just cleared the @entity14 checkpoint and was reaching for his shoes and belt when shots rang out , prompting " everybody ( to ) hit the ground and
" a @entity14 officer grabbed @entity18 's shoes and started running alongside him , before the gunman grazed the officer with a bullet
" i went and cowered in a corner , " @entity18 said
the suspect kept moving down @entity133 , equipped with three magazines for his weapon , according to the intelligence source briefed by @entity8 police , he began running down @entity133
@entity105 said two officers from his department responded " within seconds after the shooting started " and ran off in pursuit of the suspect
opinion : arming @entity14 officers not the answer traveler @entity165 was sitting at one end of the terminal , when he heard noise and saw a mass of people running toward him
he and others bolted through a kicked - open exit door and ran onto the tarmac -- believing then it was safer there -- even with then still - arriving and departing jetliners -- than in the terminal above
the circular area where @entity165 had been is where the bloodshed finally ended with the gunman 's shooting by law enforcement , according to the intelligence source
they did n't take any chances with the wounded suspect either , handcuffing him to a gurney as he was being carried out
actor @entity190 said that when he was eventually led out of the the @entity192 first - class lounge , he saw where the incident came to a head around @entity196 and 36
after being told not to step on any blood or glass , @entity190 spotted a high - powered rifle on the ground along with a pair of black shoes and several bags strewn across the floor
also there was more than 100 rounds of unspent ammunition , @entity8 mayor @entity208 said , enough to " have literally killed everyone in that terminal today
" @entity8 police chief @entity211 credited the responding airport police officers with heroically saving lives with their efforts
it was a sentiment echoed by @entity216 , a city councilman whose district includes the airport and its surrounding neighborhoods
" when shots rang out , members of the @entity222 police department ran towards that gunfire , without regard to their own safety and well being , " @entity216 said
" ... no doubt , without their efforts , the casualty count today would be significantly higher
" hundreds of flights impacted even once the suspect was shot and detained , law enforcement officers roamed the airport with guns drawn looking for others who might have involved
fast facts : 25 deadliest mass shootings in @entity239 history @entity240 showed live video of three officers with rifles to their shoulders inspecting parked cars in an open - air parking lot
at one point , firefighters lay tarps on the street at the airport , apparently for triage
the episode soon rendered one of the world 's busiest airports a ghost town
large portions were evacuated as authorities ordered a " ground stop " for arriving planes that lasted four hours
about 750 flights were affected by the ordeal , including 46 would - be arriving aircraft that were diverted to other nearby airports , said @entity266 , executive director of @entity222
some that did touch down were held on the ground in @entity8 , while others did n't leave their originating airports
@entity8 , as it 's known , was a mess
shooting delays flights nationwide the area around the airport was jammed with cars as police shut down access
meanwhile , many who were in the terminals , waiting for flights to arrive or depart , were pushed out
even as late as 4 p.m. -- some 6Â½ hours after the shooting occurred -- masses were still huddled on sidewalks outside the airport , because they had no place else to go
soon after that , people started moving back in as the airport operations kicked back into gear
terminal 3 , though , remained closed -- all flights that were supposed to go in and out of there were relocated elsewhere in the airport -- and will be " for a while , " said @entity54 of the @entity53
" this has been a trying day for everyone , i know , " @entity266 said
that 's especially true for members of the @entity14 , which lost one of its own friday and had two others wounded
the federal agency 's chief , @entity303 , is heading to @entity8 on saturday
before he left , he sent a message to his employees thanking them for their good work and support for each other
" together , we will get through this , " @entity303 wrote
" our faith will guide us and our professionalism will ensure our ability to carry out our mission
" celebrities give social media accounts of @entity8 incident
