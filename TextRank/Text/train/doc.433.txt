a @entity1 correspondent was harassed by @entity3 plainclothes police as he was live on air , reporting on tensions between the officers and demonstrators on the first anniversary of mass protests in @entity10
international correspondent @entity11 had just finished explaining that police had closed off central @entity10 to prevent demonstrators from being able to lay flowers at the sight of last year 's protests when he himself was manhandled by officers
viewers of @entity21 on saturday morning watched as officers demanded to see @entity11 's press credentials and passport , as well as those of his crew
the camera kept rolling as the officers grabbed @entity11 and started walking with him
one officer kneed him in the back
they also broke the microphone off @entity1 's camera while wrestling it out of the hands of the cameraman
the veteran reporter told anchor @entity35 , " @entity35 , we 're being detained right now
" @entity11 and his team were escorted in police custody
police officers argued that @entity11 's press accreditation , issued by the @entity3 prime ministry , could have been " counterfeited " and that he had to produce a passport
he was not permitted to leave until the passport was retrieved from the nearby @entity1 bureau
but officers did n't arrest him
according to @entity11 , after about a half - hour , the @entity1 team was released , and another officer apologized for the officer who had kneed him
police also apologized for the inconvenience
@entity11 is based in @entity10
in his 12 years in the country , the press credential has sufficed as proper identification for reporting
the demand to see a passport was unusual
he was at @entity57 , where mass protests surged a year ago
the protests began over the proposed development of a park but swelled in large anti-government demonstrations that were met with a government crackdown
activists called for nationwide demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the protests , but , as @entity11 reported , police were denying them that opportunity
on saturday , @entity69 -- the place where the protests started -- was closed off , and both riot police and plainclothes officers were deployed in large numbers
the @entity3 government accuses protesters of trying to undermine @entity3 's economy and is not allowing public displays of dissent , especially in this sensitive place , @entity11 said
protesters say they want to express their opinions freely
as night fell saturday , police fired tear gas in @entity57 to disperse the demonstrators
there were some scuffles between groups of protesters and riot police .
