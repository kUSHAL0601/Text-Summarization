@entity0 -- a @entity0 police officer accused of conspiring to kidnap , rape , torture and cook a number of women and eat their body parts has been arrested and charged in the case , the @entity2 in @entity3 said thursday
@entity12 , 28 , a six - year @entity13 veteran , was arrested wednesday at his home in @entity15
he is accused of illegally accessing a national crime database to locate potential targets , scouting some of them at their homes and workplaces and exchanging e-mails and instant messages with alleged co-conspirators about plans to target women , the attorney 's office said
" @entity12 's alleged plans to kidnap women so that they could be raped , tortured , killed , cooked and cannibalized shock the conscience , " @entity3 @entity30 attorney @entity29 said
" this case is all the more disturbing when you consider @entity12 's position as a @entity0 police officer and his sworn duty to serve and protect
" according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation , @entity12 apparently discussed the plans with other men on a website for people who fantasize about cannibalism
authorities have no evidence he planned to carry out any of the acts he allegedly plotted with others on the online fantasy website , the law enforcement source says
the source says @entity12 has a clean record
appearing in a federal court in @entity3 on thursday , @entity12 was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping and one count of illegally accessing and getting information from the @entity65 database
he did not enter a plea and is being held without bail
at thursday 's court proceeding , his lawyer @entity68 said the alleged plans discovered by authorities on @entity12 's computer amounted to " just talk
" " at worse , this is sexual fantasies with people he knows , " the defense attorney said
the @entity13 has suspended him without pay , a department spokeswoman said thursday
a criminal complaint filed in federal court says @entity12 was in contact with at least two women mentioned in his plans , though @entity87 spokesman @entity86 told @entity1 the agency has " no information to believe mr. @entity12 harmed anyone at this time
" the investigation began in september when the @entity87 learned that @entity12 was sending e-mails and instant messages from his home computer , detailing his plans , the bureau said
a search of his computer revealed a database of " at least 100 women and containing at least one photograph of each woman , " according to a statement from @entity29 's office
" the computer also contained personal information about some of these women -- including relevant addresses , physical descriptions and photographs -- and electronic communications in which @entity12 and co-conspirators detailed their plans
" the @entity87 declined to say how it learned of @entity12 's electronic communications
a law enforcement source told @entity1 that @entity12 's estranged wife contacted authorities after finding pornography on his computer
according to the court documents , the computer contained a document that @entity12 allegedly created in july , containing an action plan to cook a certain woman that authorities identify as " @entity125
" the title , authorities say , was " @entity128 [ victim 1 ] : a @entity129
" the plan , which had information about the woman 's name , date of birth , height , weight and bra size , has a section called " materials needed , " in which @entity12 allegedly wrote : " car ( i have it ) chloroform ( refer to website for directions ) rope ( strongest kind to tie her up
" the court documents say @entity12 also exchanged online messages with an alleged co-conspirator about planning to abduct and cook @entity125
in one of the exchanges , according to the court documents , @entity12 allegedly wrote , " she does look tasty , does n't she ? " " you do know if we do n't waste any of her there is nearly 75 lbs of food there , " the other person replied , according to the court documents
the complaint also says @entity12 negotiated in february with a different person on a price for @entity12 to kidnap a different woman , whom the complaint identifies only as @entity166
@entity12 wrote of kidnapping the woman for the alleged co-conspirator for $ 5,000 , and resisted the co-conspirator 's attempt to lower the price , the complaint says
" like i said this is very risky and will ruin my life if i am caught , " @entity12 wrote , according to the complaint
" i really need the money and i ca n't take under $ 5,000 for [ victim 2 ]
" the complaint also accuses @entity12 of illegally getting information about a third woman , victim 3 , from the @entity65 database
the name of that woman matched a name that investigators found in @entity187 's alleged files of women on his home computer , the complaint says
the women in @entity12 's alleged database live in the @entity30 and overseas , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation
at least three of them know @entity12 , another law enforcement source said
court documents show one of the alleged targets dined with @entity12 at a @entity201 restaurant
the 100 women are in the process of being identified , then notified by federal and local authorities
@entity1 's @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 in @entity0 and @entity209 in @entity210 contributed to this report .
