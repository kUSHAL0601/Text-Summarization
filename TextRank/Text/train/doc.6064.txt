@entity58 was in the business for 30 years and is said to have netted $ 70 million in goods with his crew , dubbed the " @entity77 " because it robbed folks while they ate in a different part of the house
he served nearly 12 years and was released in 1986 and later produced movies
according to @entity58 , he and his team never did " high - rise " jobs because there was only one way in -- and one way out
" i would think it 's somebody that knows the building pretty well and knows the shift changes and knows the comings and goings of the maid service or construction being done , and they blended in , " said @entity58
@entity49 speculates that whoever robbed the apartments did so by locating each individual apartment 's key box
