-- @entity1 overturned a two - goal deficit to beat @entity3 3 - 2 after extra time in the @entity6 final at @entity7 on saturday
@entity9 's strike in the 109th - minute sealed an 11th victory in @entity12 's premier cup competition and a first trophy in nine years for @entity15 's side
@entity16 , who were playing in their first @entity6 final , raced into a 2 - 0 lead in a frantic opening to the match
in the fourth minute , @entity22 redirected a @entity24 volley shot past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity25
five minutes later @entity27 found the back of the net again , side - footing home after the @entity31 keeper had deflected @entity33 's header onto the post
@entity35 halved the deficit with a superbly taken free - kick in the 17th minute , but @entity15 's side remained second best for the remainder of the half as @entity16 successfully disrupted the @entity42 's usually fluent passing game
@entity44 's men continued to frustrate @entity1 who were becoming more potent in open play , but it was another set piece that ended up unlocking @entity16 's defense -- @entity50 turning the ball in from a corner kick in the 71st minute
@entity53 ensued for the remainder of normal time but as the game moved into the first extra period , it was @entity1 who grew in stature as @entity16 's players wilted
@entity9 finally delivered the killer blow , firing a low shot past goalkeeper @entity64 to send @entity1 ahead for the first time in the match
as the clock ticked down @entity16 searched gamely for an equalizer and nearly got one when @entity25 rushed out from his area , but substitute @entity71 's shot from a tight angle rolled agonizingly across the face of goal
" i 'm very happy for the players , " @entity15 told @entity75 after the game
" i think it is a turning point in the lifespan of this team -- to know that they can win in that way was very important today
" " i have praised many times the spirit of this team and i 'm very proud of them today , " the 64 - year - old added
" congratulations to @entity16 , they played fantastic for the whole game today
we won it in the end but they played very well
