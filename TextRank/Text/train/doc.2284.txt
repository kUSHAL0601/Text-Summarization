@entity0 -- the @entity3 's top @entity2 said tuesday he will force a vote this week on whether to open debate on tougher gun laws , increasing pressure on legislators from both parties negotiating a possible compromise on a package that some @entity12 have threatened to filibuster
a @entity12 filibuster would mean senate majority leader @entity15 needs 60 votes on thursday just to begin @entity3 consideration of the package based on proposals by president @entity20 in the aftermath of the @entity23 school massacre in december that killed 20 first - graders and six educators
@entity20 has made gun measures a major focus of his second term agenda , holding events across the country to push for @entity31 to vote on the package
background checks on gun sales : how do they work ? he spoke monday in @entity37 , the state where the @entity23 shootings occurred , and vice president @entity39 made a similar call for action at the @entity42 on tuesday
@entity15 told reporters he hoped to get a bipartisan deal before the procedural vote on thursday
talks involving @entity48 sen. @entity47 and @entity49 sen. @entity49 of @entity50 have focused on a compromise on expanding background checks of gun buyers
@entity47 indicated late on tuesday the two were close to an agreement and have scheduled a news conference for wednesday morning
a @entity47 aide told @entity1 they are " hopeful " to have a deal to announce
@entity1 poll : background checks popular , worrisome separately , @entity48 leaders appear increasingly optimistic they will get enough @entity12 votes to overcome a threatened filibuster on starting debate
@entity48 believe as many as a dozen @entity12 will side with them and that will more than make up for the handful of pro-gun @entity48 who might not
at least five @entity12 have publicly opposed the filibuster pledged by 14 of their @entity3 colleagues , including @entity12 leader sen. @entity70 of @entity71
@entity72 later told reporters his filibuster threat referred to the specific package approved by the @entity77 and indicated he might be open to a compromise
sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , said tuesday she favored opening debate on the bill as long as amendments can be offered , adding : " i think it 's an important debate to have and i do not believe we should block the motion to proceed
" without a deal , a successful @entity12 filibuster would stop consideration of the gun legislation before any votes on specific provisions
@entity48 leaders want to give senators from both parties ample opportunity to amend the bill and are prepared to debate it beyond a scheduled recess the first week of may , if doing so will increase chances of passage
" the way you put together a coalition to pass the bill is to allow as many amendment votes as you can
we are willing to take the time to do that and have that process , " a @entity48 leadership aide told @entity1
@entity20 's rhetoric has reflected the political uncertainty , with the president and his aides using increasingly personal language intended to shame @entity12 into allowing public votes on measures that have public support but are fiercely opposed by the influential @entity119
opinion : why the @entity119 fights background checks " if senators do n't have the guts to go on the record to vote how they feel on this issue ... that would be a shame and that would be a disservice to their constituents , " @entity42 spokesman @entity122 told reporters on tuesday
at a later @entity42 event intended to keep up the public profile of the issue , @entity39 said @entity12 efforts to block tougher gun laws showed they were in a " time warp " because public support on issues such as expanded background checks " has moved beyond where it was five , ten , even three years ago
" on the other side , the @entity119 and its supporters in @entity31 argue the @entity48 proposals threaten the constitutional right to bear arms , and also offer ineffective responses intended as political show instead of real solutions to the problem of gun violence in @entity153
" on firearms questions , on @entity157 questions , there 's a divide in this country , " @entity119 president @entity154 told @entity1
" to call it an ideological divide is too simple because it 's a cultural divide
when something happens , the folks on the other side from us say , ' well the problem 's the gun , we need to do something about guns
' " defeat of the entire package in the @entity48 - led @entity3 would kill gun legislation for now , which would be a stinging defeat for @entity20 and @entity48 pushing for tougher laws
however , a public perception that @entity12 blocked popular proposals such as expanding background checks of gun buyers could harm @entity12 prospects in 2014 and 2016 among moderates they need to have any chance of countering strong support for @entity48 by minority demographics such as @entity185 , @entity186 and the gay - lesbian vote
with the high political stakes come hardball tactics and strategies
the @entity119 has long kept a comprehensive scorecard of the voting records of legislators on gun issues , which it combines with campaign contributions to try to influence elections
in response , a group led by @entity199 mayor @entity198 called @entity201 announced this week it was launching its own scorecard to identify members of @entity31 who vote against tougher gun laws
" we 're asked many times daily where people 's elected representatives are on gun laws , and we intend to tell them , in detail , " said @entity205 , director of the group of more than 900 mayors , of the campaign that will feature more than $ 1 million in cable television ads. why is this so hard ? the disconnect on background checks while most of the 12 legislators targeted by the ads are @entity12 , some are democrats from conservative - leaning states , such as rural @entity225 states where hunting and sport shooting are popular
the @entity77 passed a package of gun laws proposed by @entity20 in the @entity23 attack by a lone gunman
proposals in the committee 's package included expanding background checks on gun buyers , toughening laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , banning semi-automatic rifles modeled after military assault weapons as well as large - capacity ammunition magazines , and coming up with ideas for improving school safety
the weapons ban , which would update a similar 1994 law that expired a decade later , already has been dropped , though @entity15 , @entity247 , has promised a floor vote on it as an amendment to the package
@entity15 and the @entity42 are pushing hard for expanding background checks to all gun purchases to close a loophole that exempts private sales , such as transactions at gun conventions
should anyone be able to buy guns ? share your views on tuesday , @entity15 made a highly personal reference to his own perspective on the issue
noting that his home state requires a three - day waiting period to pick up a newly purchased gun , @entity15 contended the delay saved lives
" sometimes people in a fit of passion purchase a handgun to do bad things with it -- even as my dad did , kill themselves , " he said
" waiting a few days helps
requiring a simple background check every time a gun is sold is common sense
" if @entity12 managed to filibuster the full gun package , @entity15 said later that he would find a way to introduce each component individually to force votes
" it will take a little bit of time but as i 've said for months now , the @entity153 people deserve a vote -- on background checks , on federal trafficking , on safety in schools , on the size of clips , and yes - assault weapons
" @entity39 sounded incredulous that @entity3 @entity12 would consider blocking full consideration of legislation that matters to so many @entity186 , as demonstrated by polls that indicate overwhelming support across the spectrum for expanded background checks
for @entity302 , a wounded life has a new purpose " a tragedy that traumatized a nation and caught the attention of the entire world ... and the climax of this tragedy could be we 're not even going to get a vote ? " @entity39 said , adding " i just do n't believe they 'll do this
" @entity154 and other opponents worry that an expanded background check system would create a paper trail that could eventually be used to create a national gun registry , which they reject as unconstitutional
they also contend it would prove a burden to law - abiding gun owners while doing nothing to stop criminals from getting hold of firearms
" the one thing you know today is that if the government creates a record , it 's not secure , " @entity154 said , adding that requiring background checks on all gun sales -- the so - called universal system -- raised the question of " is it linked to a national registration scheme
" however , @entity39 accused the @entity119 of spreading false information that the proposed legislation would intrude on @entity157 rights
some states already have passed stricter gun laws similar to the federal proposals since the @entity23 shootings
they include @entity37 , where the killings occurred , and @entity346 , the site of two other notorious mass shootings that contributed to a renewed gun debate in @entity153
from gun hater to @entity119 - loving mom the current background check system was created in 1989
it requires federally approved gun dealers to check whether gun buyers have a criminal background or other problem to make them ineligible to purchase a firearm
under the system , the gun dealer maintains a record of the transaction , but the federal government keeps no such identifying paperwork
according to a @entity369 report , less than 2 % of those seeking to purchase firearms were denied due to background checks from 1998 through 2009
opponents cite that figure as evidence that the system fails to stop illegal weapons sales that the legislation seeks to target , while supporters say the result shows the system keeps some guns out of the hands of the wrong people and the system should be expanded and strengthened
a @entity381 last november cited a government report that showed 9,903 of the 14,612 homicides in the nation in 2011 involved firearms
@entity1 's @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 and @entity390 contributed to this report .
