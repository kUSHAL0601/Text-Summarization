@entity1 , @entity0 -- if your neighbor mentions their green roof you might think they have a moss problem
maybe they are simply referring to the color
but you 're unlikely to think that they have just had a mini ecosystem installed
@entity13 says green roofs can help alleviate the problems caused by storm water simply put , green roofs are gardens on your roof
they come in all shapes and sizes and range from a simple layer of turf to bite - sized hanging gardens of @entity25
but green roofs are not just aesthetic
they have important environmental benefits : they absorb storm water , reduce noise pollution , absorb heat ( thus lessening the urban heat - island effect ) and add an extra layer of insulation to buildings
that 's why they are increasingly being used on new builds as the construction industry looks to make use of greener technologies
. the concept of a green roof goes back centuries : the turf roofed dwellings of the @entity45 are early examples , but the modern green roof we know today was developed in @entity49 50 years ago
since then , they have become increasingly popular , yet the industry still struggles against skeptics , who believe green roofs to be expensive and liable to leaking
the exception to the rule has been @entity49 , where the industry is now annually worth $ 77 million
even by the end of the 1990s , 50 million square meters of @entity49 roofs , the equivalent of 10 percent of flat roofs , were recorded to be green
the industry is not faring so well in other parts of the world
while the @entity66 has seen a steady increase in interest since the 1960s , a lack of input from the industry and policy - makers has left @entity66 far behind @entity49 's booming market
in @entity72 , green roofs have taken even longer to catch on
@entity73 for @entity74 , a @entity75 non-profit industry association , conducted a survey in 2005 which indicated that only 233,000 square meters of green roofs existed in @entity72
but this was up 80 percent from the previous year , and the market continues to grow
@entity13 , who set up @entity79 to help lift the area out of poverty by creating green - collar jobs , is frustrated by this difference between the @entity85 and @entity86 industries
" in @entity49 they are down to $ 20 per square meter , which is way cheaper than a regular roof here , " she told @entity2
" there are mandates over there because of the storm water they retain , " she continued , " which is a huge drain on their resources , as it is on ours
what we are trying to do is champion the policies behind storm water
" storm water is a growing problem in cities
the lack of permeable surfaces are loading drainage systems and increasing the risk of flooding
it 's green roofs ' ability to retain high levels of precipitation that are seen as way to control and slow the water run - off
the mandates @entity122 refers to are part of @entity49 's @entity124 and @entity125
they are not a legal requirement , but through incentives set up at a city level , the mandates have helped to encourage cheaper prices
@entity132 , co-founder of @entity133 , a @entity66 web site promoting the green roof industry , believes it is the government 's responsibility to help the industry grow
" we need government bodies to accept certain civil engineering benefits , such as storm water amelioration , like the @entity49 , @entity143 and @entity144 do , " he told @entity2
" this will encourage uptake
" in many countries , the green roof industry is vulnerable to non-acceptance and a lack of understanding
@entity132 says , " there are problems with the construction industry viewing vegetation as a problem and not a benefit
" green roofs also struggle against better - known technologies such as solar panels , but @entity132 points out , " solar panels can work better on green roofs than on gray roofs
" despite this lack of support , the green roof industry is growing
in @entity1 alone , there are approximately 1 million square meters of green roofs planned , with about 200,000 square meters already installed
and as climate change stays in the headlines , the popularity of green roofs is growing
according to @entity132 , " over the last eight years , green roofs [ in the @entity66 ] have gone from being a very marginal approach to a mainstream approach
cities such as @entity1 and @entity175 are now asking for them as part of planning applications
" but @entity132 also believes that support from local government , as opposed to a centrally driven policy , is key to the industry 's growth
" in @entity144 , green roofs are federal law , but again this is interpreted at a cantonal and city level , " he told @entity2
" this is a much better approach than driven by the center
" managing the industry through federal laws offers a general framework which can then be interpreted as needed
in an industry that varies from project to project , this flexibility is a valuable asset
so the green roof industry continues to grow -- but there 's a feeling that government support could be better
with a little more encouragement , what once was an eccentric way to roof your home could soon become the universal standard , turning our cities into lush , green metropolises
but then , it 's not easy being green
