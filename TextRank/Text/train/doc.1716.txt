-- " @entity1 " will begin its 40th season saturday , and in its first 39 years it 's produced at least 39 hilarious sketches
you 're probably playing them in your mind right now : the @entity8 , @entity9 , some @entity11 bit with @entity12
hey , whatever floats your boat
40 reasons why ' snl ' is still awesome but some are just better than others , right ? now , a few caveats : â € ¢ i 'm old
i celebrated my 104th birthday last week , and i remember when electricity was transmitted by horse - drawn train car
so if these choices skew older , that 's one reason
prefer more contemporary sketches ? add your opinion in the comments -- or , better yet , head on over to @entity31 and write up your own thoughts
â € ¢ @entity33 is selective
it 's not that i do n't appreciate " d * * k in a @entity46 , " @entity34 as @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 as @entity38 and @entity39 or " @entity40 , " but the shock and hilarity of some sketches are just stronger than others
your mileage , of course , may vary
â € ¢ comedy is subjective
it makes you laugh or it does n't
these made me laugh -- and also , sometimes , gasp
so here 's one guy 's opinion of " @entity1 's " five best sketches ( short films included )
and sorry to disappoint you , but " @entity60 " is n't among them : " @entity61 " ( first season , 1976 ) the @entity64 saga was still part of the everyday news cycle when this skit , based on the @entity70 - @entity69 best - seller , made its appearance
@entity72 was at his @entity82 best as the 37th president , a paranoid figure taking his anger out on @entity76 ( @entity77 ) and the paintings of presidents on the @entity81 walls
the truly scary thing is that @entity84 and @entity85 , who wrote the skit , did n't have to change that much from the book
" @entity87 " ( season 10 , 1984 ) @entity88 , who had risen to stardom as an " snl " cast member , returned as host for a december 1984 episode
in this short film , he went undercover to " experience @entity93 as a white man
" he finds that we do , truly , live in two distinct countries
his stiff - legged walk alone is worth watching
" president @entity99 , mastermind " ( season 12 , 1986 ) to his critics , @entity99 was an infuriatingly disengaged president -- but , as " @entity1 " producer @entity101 has observed , he was a hard president to criticize because he was so sunny and optimistic
finally , @entity102 and @entity84 came up with this sketch , with a cutting @entity105 as @entity99
who knew he could speak @entity107 ? " @entity108 " ( season 17 , 1991 ) beer commercials have long followed the same formula : surround male schlubs with good - looking women in impossible scenarios
" @entity121 " was a fake ad that turned the formula around , with @entity116 and @entity117 as two guys who crack open some beers -- and are immediately surrounded by hot men
you 'll never watch a beer ad the same way again
" @entity125 " ( season 22 , 1996 ) @entity125 is going on vacation , and his producer wants to make sure every option is covered -- which includes the obituary of @entity130 ( who was very much alive at the time )
but you can never be too prepared when it comes to possibilities
what if the president is eaten by wolves ?
