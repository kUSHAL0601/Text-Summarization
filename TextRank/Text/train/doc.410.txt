-- @entity1 is proposing to convene an emergency consultation with members of the six - party talks amid growing tensions on the @entity6 , a @entity1 official and an @entity9 official said sunday
" the @entity1 side , after careful studies , proposes to have emergency consultations among the heads of delegation to the six - party talks in early december in @entity19 to exchange views on major issues of concern to the parties at present , " @entity10 , @entity1 special representative for @entity6 peninsula affairs , told journalists
" the six - party talks play an important role in strengthening communication among the parties , advancing denuclearization on the peninsula and safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula and in northeast @entity32 , " he said
as both @entity34 's largest trading partner and a country engaged in diplomatic talks with @entity37 , @entity1 is dealing with both sides of an increasingly divided @entity6
diplomats , seeking a lessening of tensions and a return to the six - party talks with @entity34 over the country 's nuclear aspirations , have busily labored to avert more hostilities
the @entity9 , @entity1 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity37 and @entity34 are the six countries that have been involved in the discussions , which were put on hold in 2008
" the @entity9 is consulting with @entity37 , @entity47 and other countries on @entity1 's proposal for emergency talks on the @entity6 crisis , " a @entity53 spokesperson told @entity0 sunday
" the six - party talks can not substitute for action by @entity34 to comply with its obligations , " said the spokesperson , who was not authorized to speak for attribution
" @entity63 steps by @entity34 are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior
" " we have called on @entity1 to urge @entity34 to restrain its provocations and responsibly act in the interests of peace and stability , " the spokesperson said
@entity1 said the proposed emergency consultations do not mean a resumption of the six - party talks , @entity1 's state media reported
the @entity37 government will " bear in mind " @entity1 's proposal , according to a @entity79 press release
but the government added that given the current situation , the proposal " needs to be carefully reviewed
" @entity9 sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , said on @entity0 's " @entity84 " sunday that @entity1 is the key to resolving the conflict , but said the country is " not behaving as a responsible world power
" " they could bring the @entity6 economy to its knees if they wanted to
and i can not believe that the @entity1 should , in a mature fashion , not find it in their interest to restrain @entity34
so far , they are not , " @entity82 said
@entity82 called the proposal for a six - party meeting a " fine first step , " but said that @entity34 's history of confrontation will not come to a stop without significant penalties
tensions on the @entity6 mounted last week when four @entity37 died after @entity34 's shelling of @entity108 during a @entity37 military drill tuesday
@entity34 said the @entity37 provoked the attack because shells from the @entity37 drill landed in the @entity34 's waters
" we express our condolences to the victims of the @entity108 island incident and will make efforts for the sake of peace between @entity121 so that the situation does not deteriorate , " @entity1 state councilor @entity122 said during a meeting with @entity37 president @entity124 on sunday
the @entity37 president asked that @entity1 " contribute to achieving peace on the @entity6 with a fairer and responsible position in regards to @entity131 relations
" @entity124 added that " @entity37 has endured endless provocations from the @entity34 since the @entity133 , but if @entity34 carries out an additional provocation , we will take strong countermeasures
" on sunday , @entity37 and the @entity9 began joint military exercises on the @entity137 -- another point of contention in the region
@entity34 has warned of unpredictable " consequences " if the @entity9 fulfilled its vow of deploying an aircraft carrier to the @entity137 for the military maneuvers
" the @entity34 [ @entity34 ] will deal a merciless military counter-attack at any provocative act of intruding into its territorial waters in the future , " @entity34 's official @entity145 said sunday
@entity1 appeared to have criticized the joint military exercises last week
" we oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission , " @entity79 spokesman @entity151 said in a statement , according to @entity1 's state - run @entity154 news agency
the @entity1 - @entity34 relations take another step on tuesday , when @entity162 , chairman of @entity34 's @entity164 , will pay an official visit to @entity1 , @entity154 reported
@entity167 was invited by @entity168 , chairman of the @entity169 of the @entity170 , the agency said
@entity0 's @entity171 and journalist @entity124 contributed to this report .
