@entity1 gunmen kidnapped at least 30 boys and girls from a village in northeast @entity5 during the weekend
the abductions appear to be the latest in a string of recent kidnappings by @entity1 that dims hope for the anticipated release of 219 schoolgirls ‎ held by the group since april following a controversial ceasefire declared by @entity5 authorities
holding on to hope for missing girls heavily armed @entity1 gunmen invaded the town of @entity19 in @entity21 state friday and saturday and seized 30 boys and girls , local leaders said
the news of the kidnappings was slow to emerge due to lack of telecom service in the region , where most telecom towers have been destroyed in @entity1 's five - year insurgency against @entity5 's government
" ‎ in the past two days @entity1 insurgents stormed @entity19 and abducted 30 boys aged 13 and above and girls aged 11 and above , " @entity19 local government chairman @entity31 said
despite so - called ceasefire , @entity1 kidnappings continue " they took them away to their base in the bush , and we believe they are going to use them as foot soldiers , " @entity31 said
@entity44 , the local chief of @entity19 who confirmed the abductions , said the kidnappers also stole 300 cows from the farming community in the raid
the @entity5 government has said @entity1 has denied involvement in the kidnappings , but the group has issued no public statement on the issue
regardless , @entity1 's near - daily raids have prompted an exodus of residents from @entity19 and nearby villages to the @entity21 state capital of @entity61 to escape the marauding insurgents , @entity44 said
on thursday @entity1 killed 17 people in the nearby village of @entity65 , which they looted and set ablaze , @entity31 said
" many people have fled with their families to @entity61 for fear of being killed or losing their children to the insurgents , " @entity44 said
@entity31 lamented that the military had done nothing to stop the raids despite repeated complaints by local leaders
last week @entity1 militia kidnapped 60 women and girls in two @entity80 villages in neighboring @entity82 state , according to residents and community leaders .
