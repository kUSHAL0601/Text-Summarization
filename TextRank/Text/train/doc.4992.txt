-- @entity1 , @entity2 's most popular microblogging platform , has introduced a vip paid membership package in an effort to monetize its vast community of 324 million users who use its services for free
the vip membership includes fifteen " special privileges " under the categories of user personalization , functions , mobile phone , and security
these perks range from using fancier homepage templates , following a higher number of users , and receiving @entity21 birthday alerts and password reminders
users can increasingly access these features , as they progress through six different levels of membership based on points awarded for usage
a one - month subscription is priced at 10 rmb ( us $ 1.57 )
discounts are offered for longer subscriptions of three months to two years
the vip package has generally been met with muted enthusiasm by industry analysts
the free features of the site are sufficient for users , @entity34 , an analyst at @entity37 - based internet consultancy @entity35 , told state newspaper , @entity41
he predicted the premium services would not be significantly profitable and recommended that @entity43 concentrate on advertising and gaming revenues
this move follows monetization initiatives introduced last year , such as " @entity48 " virtual currency and " @entity51 " custom account numbers
@entity43 , which also operates the popular @entity43 web portal , reported a net loss of us $ 13.7 million for the first quarter of 2012 , despite a 6 % year - on - year increase in net revenue to $ 106.2 million .
