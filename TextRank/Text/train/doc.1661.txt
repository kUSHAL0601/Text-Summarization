@entity0 -- a @entity5 - born man known for masquerading as a @entity6 has been ordered to stand trial for murder , the prosecutor 's office said wednesday
@entity6 is accused of killing a man who disappeared in the mid- 1980s and whose bones were discovered in his mother 's @entity12 backyard nine years later after a five - day preliminary hearing , @entity15 judge @entity14 ruled tuesday there was sufficient probable cause to bind @entity6 over for trial , said @entity20 , a spokeswoman for the @entity0 district attorney 's office
@entity6 , 50 , is scheduled to be arraigned on february 9 , @entity20 said
the dismembered remains of @entity24 , who was 27 at the time of his 1985 disappearance , were found in 1994 by workers installing a backyard pool at a home his mother once owned in @entity32 , @entity12
at the time of @entity24 ' disappearance , @entity6 had been renting a guesthouse from @entity24 ' mother , @entity20 said
during the preliminary hearing , a pool builder described how he discovered a skull buried in the yard , and investigators eventually found nearly an entire skeleton
the remains were not identified until 2010
evidence showed that the bones belonged to @entity24 , @entity20 said
during the preliminary hearing , @entity14 rejected a defense request that @entity6 be referred to as " mr. @entity6 " in court
the defense attorney said he and other attorneys on the team knew @entity6 as " mr. @entity6
" @entity6 , who has led a life of multiple identities , has denied involvement in the @entity24 case
at one point in his life , @entity6 assumed the identity of " @entity6 , " a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job
a @entity62 tabloid dubbed him " @entity63
" there has even been a @entity66 movie , " @entity68 ? " starring @entity67 as @entity6
@entity6 has been serving a four - to five - year sentence in @entity70 for kidnapping his then - 7 - year - old daughter from his ex-wife in 2008
he was transferred from a prison in that state to @entity12 in july , authorities said
@entity6 's bail in @entity12 was set at $ 10 million , but that bail is moot because he is being held on the @entity70 sentence , @entity20 said
the whereabouts of the dead man 's wife , @entity80 , are unknown
except for a few postcards that appeared to have been mailed by the couple from @entity86 in 1985 , her friends and family have not heard from her
a spokeswoman for the prosecutor 's office has said her disappearance is still under investigation
@entity6 's @entity70 prison term will end in mid- 2012 , authorities said
he will receive credit for that @entity70 sentence while being held in @entity12 , authorities said
@entity6 came to the @entity96 from @entity5 in 1978 , according to testimony at his trial for kidnapping
after spending a few years in @entity100 , he moved to @entity101 , where he married in a green card arrangement using his true name
@entity6 then relocated to @entity12
he settled in @entity32 , a wealthy community near @entity105 , where he lived under the name @entity6 from 1983 to 1985
he posed as a film student and boasted that he was of @entity109 royalty , according to @entity111 magazine , which profiled him in january 2009 and quoted several people who knew " @entity6 " at the time
as @entity6 , he rented a guest house from @entity115
her son @entity116 and his wife , @entity117 , came to live with @entity118 during the time @entity6 lived in the guest quarters
his relationship with the couple is unclear
@entity118 told investigators she believed that her son and daughter - in - law were in @entity125 after she and one of @entity80 ' friends received @entity86 - postmarked cards in mid- 1985 , purportedly from the couple
investigators were suspicious of the cards ' authenticity
@entity24 sold the house in late 1985 after suffering a stroke
she died three years later
through luminol testing of the guest quarters where @entity6 lived , investigators found what appeared to be a large amount of blood
( @entity141 causes a glow when it comes in contact with blood
) it is not clear when the luminol testing took place , but police thoroughly searched the house when the remains were found and again after @entity6 's arrest in the kidnapping case
a former neighbor quoted by @entity111 reported that @entity155 borrowed a chainsaw from him around the time the couple went missing
an acquaintance , @entity158 , said she " saw an area of dirt that had obviously been dug up and filled in " at the time , according to the @entity162
when she asked him why , @entity6 told her he was having plumbing problems
@entity165 's detectives from @entity0 sought @entity6 for questioning in early may 1985 , but he had disappeared in a pickup registered to @entity24
he resurfaced under yet another identity , that of @entity168 , in @entity100 in the late 1980s
in late 1988 , @entity168 tried to sell @entity24 ' pickup to a man in @entity100
when he could n't produce the proper paperwork for the truck , the prospective buyer reported him to police
@entity100 police soon learned that @entity6 and @entity168 were the same person , although at that time , no one knew that his true name was @entity6
@entity168 disappeared before police could question him
he resurfaced in @entity178 in 1993 as @entity6
authorities learned shortly after the 2008 kidnapping of his daughter that @entity6 was not @entity6
he was arrested in @entity182 , where he was hiding out with the daughter
he had already assumed a new identity : a ship 's captain named @entity187 who , with his daughter , @entity188 , was relocating to @entity189
his second wife , @entity191 - educated financial executive @entity190 , testified that she spent more than a dozen years with him before growing suspicious that " @entity6 " was not who he said he was
they met in @entity194 and were married in @entity195 , @entity70
their daughter , @entity196 , was born on may 24 , 2001 , and her father nicknamed her " @entity199
" the couple divorced in 2007 after @entity201 hired a private investigator to conduct a background check , according to testimony at the kidnapping trial .
