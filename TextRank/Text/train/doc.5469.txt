@entity0 -- this is a country which says races do n't exist : there is only the human race , to which we all belong
this is a country which , unlike the @entity8 and @entity9 , has purposefully limited freedom of speech in order to criminalize verbal violence and incitement to hatred in all its forms
but this is also a country where the black justice minister @entity18 is welcomed by a child with the words " hey , guenon [ monkey ] , go and eat bananas ! " the 12 - year - old girl who uttered those words in the town of @entity26 on october 25 had come with her parents to protest against the same - sex marriage law of which the minister has become a symbol
in the crowd of protesters were a dozen children shouting the word guenon ; their parents looked pleased , proud even
and we thought , naively , and rather condescendingly , that this sort of racist abuse could only be found in a country like @entity40 , ethnically less diverse than @entity41
we all remembered @entity40 's former prime minister @entity42 repeatedly describing @entity8 president @entity43 as " really much tanned "
we all remembered , earlier this year , @entity47 - born @entity46 , @entity40 's first ever black minister , having bananas thrown at her
@entity40 senator @entity48 even referred to her as " having the features of an orangutan
" we thought such coarse xenophobia could not take place here
no , surely not in @entity41 ! how wrong we were
it actually took many of us by surprise
the fact that parents asked their children to hurl racist abuse at a government minister added to the sense of shock
as explained in a timelime in @entity41 weekly @entity65 ' , it actually took days for the @entity41 political class to react to the racist insults endured by @entity18
why such dithering ? some were embarrassed ; others feared they might exacerbate the current tension in @entity41 if they made too big a fuss
the same sex marriage legal battle which raged on last year seems to have reopened a box we thought long shut : @entity41 has witnessed the resurgence of a far - right alliance between traditionalist catholics and ultra-conservatives who suddenly see themselves as the new revolutionaries
at night , they dream of insurrection
it has sometimes felt like being thrown back in time , to the 1930s
on november 13 , however , @entity87 , an extreme - right publication which ran the monkey analogy on its front page , was formally investigated for racism , and interior minister @entity92 said he was looking at blocking the distribution of the magazine
" we can not let this pass , " he said
" this is not just @entity18 who has been attacked for her color
it is the @entity100 , it is @entity41 and its values that are under attack
" for the @entity0 - based @entity106 poet and writer @entity107 , in an open letter called " racism , the ultimate temptation " and published in the @entity40 daily @entity109 on november 15 : " everywhere in @entity112 , we see the resurgence of racism
it may only be words but it could end with the gas chambers
" according to @entity107 , @entity41 is no more racist than its neighbors but the real problem is that , today , racism finds an ideal breeding ground on social networks where anonymity unleashes unrestrained violence
in a famous recent case , the @entity41 justice system , often harsher on verbal violence than many other countries , has tried to stop @entity127 from serving as a platform for all kinds of xenophobic abuses presented as " jokes
" in october 2012 , racist hashtags in @entity41 such as # @entity133 or # @entity134 unleashed the worse examples of unrestrained racism
in @entity41 , racial insults in public are punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of up to â ‚ ¬ 25,000 ; @entity41 justice was determined to sanction the xenophobic twitterati
at first , @entity127 told the @entity41 justice it could not reveal its users ' identities and would only obey the laws of @entity146 where it was based
but @entity41 judges argued -- successfully -- that the targeted public and the racist perpetrators were @entity41 - speakers operating from @entity41
@entity127 eventually complied to reveal the identity of those who had generated racist tweets so they could be prosecuted in @entity41 : a victory
@entity41 judges should now turn their attention to the @entity41 parents who teach their children to shout racist insults at a government minister born in @entity41 @entity161
punitive sentences would be welcome
as would the end of anonymity on social networks
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .
