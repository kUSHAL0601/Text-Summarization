@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has deported a @entity6 - born @entity5 cleric who was previously jailed in @entity7 for inciting racial hatred , the @entity1 immigration minister said thursday
@entity10 was deported to the @entity12 country of @entity13 , @entity1 immigration minister @entity9 told reporters in the @entity1 capital , @entity0
@entity1 anti-terror police picked up @entity10 days ago after he passed into the country unnoticed , police spokesman @entity16 told @entity2 on tuesday
@entity1 's immigration minister declared him an unwanted person in @entity1 , @entity16 said , adding that @entity10 is a threat to @entity1 's security with " proven " terrorism links
@entity25 was sentenced in @entity26 to nine years in prison in march 2003 for inciting others to commit murder and for stirring racial hatred
he had been arrested a year earlier
he was paroled in 2007 after serving half his sentence and deported to @entity6 , according to @entity7 news reports
@entity25 entered @entity1 from @entity33 , @entity16 said , but it was not clear when
@entity16 acknowledged there had been " lapses " between @entity1 's police and immigration that allowed the cleric to enter the country
@entity1 @entity5 groups have protested the moves to deport @entity10
" he is being treated unfairly , " said @entity43 , the executive coordinator for the @entity44 , " he has committed no crimes in @entity6 and has not committed any crimes in @entity1
there is a double standard at work
" before his sentence in @entity7 , @entity10 had spent much of the previous decade preaching in various mosques and selling audiotapes across the country
in one of the tapes , he said , " how do you fight the @entity57 ? you have to bomb the @entity61 businesses
and as for the @entity62 , you kill them physically
then you will overcome them in @entity64 and in @entity65
" his lawyers in @entity7 had asked the judge in his case to consider the @entity5 convert " misguided rather than malicious
" the defense stressed that most of his preachings were benign interpretations of the @entity74
they also said @entity10 , a husband and father who had been living in the east @entity26 neighborhood of @entity78 , had been a leader in his community
@entity2 's @entity80 contributed to this report .
