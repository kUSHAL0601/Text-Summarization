-- @entity2 's history at major tournaments recently suggests no one should be calling " @entity2 " title contenders at this year 's @entity5 just yet but after friday 's game against @entity9 even the team 's harshest critics must be optimistic
@entity2 crushed @entity9 5 - 2 in @entity11 and almost booked its spot in the second round with two wins from as many games in @entity16 the last time the @entity17 went 2 - 0 to start a @entity5 , it won the title on home soil in 1998
now that 's a good omen
things could still go wrong , however
look at the @entity22 two years ago , when @entity23 led a long unbeaten @entity17 side to @entity25 and @entity26
still unbeaten and already qualified for the quarterfinals with a game to spare , @entity2 came unstuck in a dead rubber against @entity30 and subsequently crumbled against @entity31
the infighting , present in @entity33 in 2010 , resurfaced
current @entity17 boss @entity34 -- @entity23 's teammate on the @entity5 winning squad -- is so far managing to keep the side unified and has found a way to unlock striker @entity39
@entity39 netted twice against @entity40 in the opening 3 - 0 victory and scored again against the fragile @entity43 , adding two assists
@entity2 threatened to score almost every time it went forward
striker @entity45 was hoping for a start against the @entity43 and @entity34 duly inserted the @entity48 man into the lineup
he repaid his manager with a header in the 17th minute and less than a minute later , the @entity17 realistically put the @entity43 away as @entity52 beat keeper @entity53 with a low shot to the near post
it would have been three had @entity39 not seen his penalty saved by @entity53
the football was still free flowing and it came as no surprise when @entity45 set up @entity60 from close range in the 40th minute
@entity39 made it four in the 67th minute before @entity63 further humbled the @entity43 six minutes later
two @entity43 goals in the final 10 minutes made the score respectable
@entity66 beat @entity67 with a low free kick in the 81st minute and @entity69 cut the deficit to three in the 87th
those goals could be pivotal for the @entity43 given goal difference is the first criteria to separate teams when tied in the standings
thus , when @entity39 had a goal disallowed because the final whistle blew , there was more relief for @entity9
@entity9 remains on three points , while @entity82 rose to three and leapfrogged @entity9 on goal difference by later defeating @entity40 2 - 1
@entity84 shines with both teams realistically needing a win to progress to the next round , the first half between @entity82 and @entity40 was messy but delightfully end - to - end in @entity90
@entity91 spurned a chance early for the @entity93 and @entity40 celebrated wildly when @entity94 scored his team 's first goal at a @entity5 in 32 years with a low finish near the edge of the box
instead of holding firm , though , @entity40 quickly conceded in the 34th minute to reawaken @entity82
@entity91 , @entity82 's talisman , was the quickest to react at the far post and poked the ball home from a few yards out as he scored in a sixth consecutive game for his country
@entity40 ' burly central defender @entity107 stung the palms of keeper @entity109 with an impressive long - range free kick just before halftime and @entity94 's header struck the bar in stoppage time
the ball went into the net on a rebound , though the officials rightly ruled that @entity119 used his arm to score
after the interval , @entity121 seemed to be fouled by @entity40 ' @entity123 in the box but the referee signaled play to continue
@entity40 had another goal disallowed thanks to offside and @entity84 soared above the defense to deposit his winning header home from @entity132 's pinpoint free kick in the 65th
costly narrowly missed latching on to a low cross and @entity123 's shot from distance was n't far off but @entity82 hung on
although @entity2 is in pole position and @entity40 needs a minor miracle to advance , nothing officially has been decided in the group
@entity2 plays @entity82 and @entity9 plays @entity40 on wednesday .
