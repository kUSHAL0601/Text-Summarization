-- with all passengers and crew aboard @entity4 from @entity5 now accounted for , air crash investigators are beginning the painstaking search for clues as to why the incident , which killed at least two people , happened
while the sequence of events that led to accident remains unclear , witnesses described hearing a " boom " as the @entity15 appeared to come in short , touching down heavily on the runway close to the water 's edge at @entity19 before it disappeared in a cloud of smoke
parts of the aircraft , including its tail section and engines , snapped off as it spun off the tarmac on its belly
passenger : ' i just crash landed at @entity19
surreal ' " for whatever reason , the pilot did not have enough power available to correct the rate of descent that brought him into contact with the ground before he wanted to be there , " @entity34 , an aviation expert and former airline pilot , told @entity0
" there are a number of other considerations that may or may not have been made clear : one of them has to do with the fact that at least on one other occasion -- with a [ @entity15 ] 777 in @entity52 -- they were on approach to land and they also ended up landing short
it 's my understanding that it was all because of a fuel situation
for one reason or another , the throttles were moving but the engines were not increasing their thrust
therefore they landed short of the runway and short of the power they needed to continue with a safe landing
" @entity67 from @entity68 landed short of the runway at @entity52 's @entity70 in january 2008 after losing critical power as it prepared to touch down
fortunately , the pilot was able to partially control the impact , allowing everyone on board to escape serious injury
investigators believe the incident was caused by ice in the fuel system of the @entity15
their report suggested the aircraft passed through unusually cold air over @entity84 as it traveled from the @entity86 capital
" mechanical things can be present in these airplanes that will make it impossible for the crew to do the things that they know how to do , " @entity34 added
@entity93 , a former @entity15 aviation safety engineer , agreed @entity4 's touch down point was far shorter than intended
" it should never even have been close to hitting the seawall at the edge of the runway like that , " he said
@entity93 said the pilot rather than the computer would have been in control at this point
" typically the pilot would be hand - flying the plane right at the final approach
this was a relatively good - weather day
they did n't have to have a full auto - land system in place -- even when you have a lot of automated systems right before touch down , you 're going to have the pilots under positive control of the aircraft , " he said
" as for why it hit the runway the way it did , or how fast it was , it depends in the weight of the aircraft and other factors
but this is something that has to be discovered through the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder
" how fast this aircraft was going , both horizontally along the ground and its vertical speed , that may be the critical factor that made it land so short
" the initial impact was strong enough to cause both horizontal stabilizers and the vertical fin to come off the aircraft
this was major , major structural damage , which made it very difficult to control the aircraft
" flight data recorders recovered from crash @entity93 said investigators would be keen to speak to the crew as soon as possible
" of course we have all sorts of information from the ' black boxes ' but the state of mind of the pilots -- why they made the decisions they did prior to landing -- is something that would be very important to know
" also , from outward appearances , until the very end of the flight it looks as though things on the flight were normal
one question i would like to ask those pilots is : ' was there anything going on in the minutes or hours leading up to the landing where you were taken off your usual schedule , where you doing things not on the checklist , where you are not following procedures ? was there anything out of place or out of the ordinary ? ' " why crash was survivable
