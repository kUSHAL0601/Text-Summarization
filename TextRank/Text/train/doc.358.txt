-- the worst cholera outbreak in @entity3 in 15 years has killed more than 4,000 @entity4 , and the crisis threatens to worsen when the rainy season hits , the @entity1 said thursday

the rainy season could threaten more lives
the preventable disease has spread through the southern @entity3 country in the past 10 months because of faulty sewage systems , uncollected refuse and a lack of clean water , @entity1 said
" last year , we had a near collapse of basic social services , " said @entity19 , a spokeswoman for the organization
" municipal services were not providing clean water anymore and they were not collecting refuse anymore
there was also a collapse of the health - delivery system
so if you went to the clinic and you were affected by cholera , you would not be attended to
" the possibility of a new wave of cholera cases looms , @entity19 said
" we might have another spike in the number of cases once we have our first rain , because cholera is waterborne and the contaminated water will be flowing towards open sources and people will be drinking from unprotected wells , " she said
nearly 100,000 people have been infected since the current epidemic broke out , according to a new @entity49 report
the cholera crisis comes as @entity4 is struggling with an economic meltdown
in may , @entity4 announced that it would receive a $ 22 million grant from the @entity53 to help the country 's battered economy .
