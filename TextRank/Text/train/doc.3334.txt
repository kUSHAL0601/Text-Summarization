-- when @entity2 retired from the @entity4 @entity3 in june 1991 , a reporter asked him what were the medical reasons that contributed to his leaving the bench -- and its lifetime appointment -- after serving for nearly 25 years
he was his usual blunt self
" what 's wrong with me ? " @entity2 said at the packed news conference
i 'm getting old and falling apart
" when the news broke this week that @entity15 @entity14 was stepping down as the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion @entity17 because of his concerns about being able to do the job , many began to speculate that there were other reasons for the decision
we have become accustomed to a pope dying in office
that 's not a surprise
it has been nearly 600 years since the last pope , @entity29 , quit in 1415
even though the job of pope is a lifetime appointment , frankly , it is selfish of any individual to hold on to the job for dear life , knowing full well they do n't have the capacity to do the job
" strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me , " according to a statement from @entity14 released by the @entity49
whether we want to be honest or not , it was sad to watch the decline of pope @entity53 he was a vibrant figure when he became pope in 1978 , traveling the world and spreading the gospel to anyone who would listen
but toward the end of his life in 2005 , he was barely able to move or talk , clearly worn down by significant health challenges
any leader who respects the organization they serve should have the common sense to know when it 's time to say goodbye
we 've seen countless examples of @entity69 , pastors , politicians and others hang on and on to a position of power , hurting the very people they were elected or chosen to serve
it takes considerable courage for anyone to step away from the power bestowed upon them by a position , as well as the trappings that come with it
i 'll leave it to others to try to figure out other reasons behind the resignation
but we should at least acknowledge the value of an ego-less decision that reflects humility and concern about the very institution the pope pledged his life to
all leaders should be concerned about their institution continuing to grow and thrive once their days are no more
that 's why a proper succession plan is vitally important
too often we have assessed great leaders by what they did in their positions
but their final legacy really is defined by how they left a place
pope @entity14 knows full well the @entity17 can not grow and prosper if its leader is limited in traveling and attending to his flock
there comes a time when one chapter must end and another begins
he has more days behind him than in front of him
he should enjoy his last years in peace and tranquility , without having to worry about trying to do the work designed for a younger man
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .
