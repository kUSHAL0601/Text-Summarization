protesters knock down barriers near the @entity2 embassy during a demonstration in central @entity16
angry protests also took place in several cities around the world on sunday against @entity2 after its air strikes in @entity5 killed at least 270 people and wounded hundreds more
in @entity16 , hundreds of demonstrators battled riot police in an attempt to enter the @entity2 embassy , according to media reports
but neither side indicated they were ready to heed the calls for calm
@entity2 prime minister @entity30 said the operation in @entity5 " is liable to continue for some time , perhaps more than can be foreseen at the present time
" @entity33 , too , showed no signs of backing down , saying @entity2 had violated an @entity36 - brokered cease - fire intended to stem violence in the region
" we will stand up , we will defend our own people , we will defend our land and we will not give up , " senior spokesman @entity39 said
for a second day , black plumes of smoke rose above @entity45 as makeshift ambulances screamed down rubble - strewn streets , taking wounded @entity3 to hospitals already crowded with hundreds of patients wounded this weekend
more than 110 @entity33 rockets have been launched into @entity2 by @entity33 militants since saturday morning , an @entity51 spokesman said
an @entity2 man died when a rocket slammed into a home saturday , @entity51 said
the @entity6 ambassador to the @entity7 , @entity57 , supported @entity2 's contention that it was up to @entity33 to stop the violence
" @entity2 has the right to self defense and nothing in this press statement should be read as anything but that , " @entity57 said
the @entity6 has warned @entity2 , however , to avoid civilian casualties
@entity2 leaders maintain they are attempting to do so
@entity69 spokesman @entity68 " @entity33 ' continued rocket attacks into @entity2 must cease if the violence is to stop
@entity33 must end its terrorist activities if it wishes to play a role in the future of the @entity3 people
the @entity6 urges @entity2 to avoid civilian casualties as it targets @entity33 in @entity5
" @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity7 , @entity77 , responded that her country was only defending itself from @entity33 rocket attacks
" the last days were so bad that we had to say , and did say , ' @entity80 is enough , ' " @entity77 said
" the only party to blame is the @entity33
" @entity83 , adviser to @entity85 president @entity84 , urged @entity2 and @entity33 leaders to enact another cease - fire
" i believe this is the only way out
i do n't think this problem can be solved through military means
violence will breed more violence , " he said saturday
the power base for @entity84 ' @entity94 party is in the @entity95
the party is locked in a power struggle with @entity33 , which won parliamentary elections in january 2006 and wrested @entity5 from @entity94 in violent clashes last year
@entity84 , a @entity6 ally , wields little influence in @entity5
@entity7 secretary general @entity102 's office issued a statement saying he was deeply alarmed by the violence and bloodshed in @entity5 and in southern @entity2
" while recognizing @entity2 's security concerns regarding the continued firing of rockets from @entity5 , he firmly reiterates @entity2 's obligation to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law and condemns excessive use of force leading to the killing and injuring of civilians
he condemns the ongoing rocket attacks by @entity3 militants and is deeply distressed that repeated calls on @entity33 for these attacks to end have gone unheeded , " a spokesman said
the @entity121 ended a four - hour emergency meeting sunday with a call for an immediate halt to hostilities and a re-opening of border crossings to allow humanitarian supplies to reach @entity5
the @entity3 ' @entity7 envoy said if @entity2 does not halt attacks within 48 hours , @entity131 delegations will demand stronger action from the @entity121
@entity135 foreign secretary @entity134 called on sunday for an urgent ceasefire and immediate halt to all violence
" the deteriorating humanitarian situation is deeply disturbing
prime minister ( @entity140 ) has spoken to prime minister @entity30 of @entity2
as we made clear yesterday , @entity2 must abide by its humanitarian obligations
" the @entity135 supports the prompt and sufficient delivery of food , fuel and medicine into the @entity5
i have discussed this unfolding crisis with my counterparts in the region and beyond
ireport.com : are you there ? " i have discussed with @entity36 foreign minister @entity156 his plans to convene a meeting of @entity160 foreign ministers
this is an important opportunity for @entity131 leaders to make clear that the interests of the @entity3 people can only be secured through a viable @entity3 state existing alongside a secure @entity2
we must renew our collective effort to achieve this goal in 2009
" @entity169 also urged both sides to refrain from violence
" @entity174 believes it is necessary to immediately stop a large - scale military operation against @entity5 , which has already led to numerous casualties and sufferings of peaceful @entity3 , " @entity173 spokesman @entity172 said
" at the same time , we are urging the leadership of @entity33 to stop missile strikes upon @entity2 territory
we are sure that what needs to be done without delay now is stop military confrontation , restore a cease - fire , and rid peaceful civilians on both sides of terror and pain
" @entity192 's @entity191 by contrast urged " @entity2 aggression " that targets " innocent civilians including women and children " to end
" the establishment of an independent @entity3 state on the @entity3 national soil is a prerequisite to achieve security and stability , " he said , adding that @entity2 will not get security and peace unless it ends what he called its " occupation
" @entity210 's supreme leader has declared monday a " day of mourning " for @entity3 in @entity5 , blaming the violence on " the bloodthirsty nature of the @entity213
" the state - run news agency @entity215 said ayatollah @entity217 was urging all @entity219 nations , as well as " freedom seekers , " intellectuals and media " to fulfill their heavy duty in confronting the crimes of the ' @entity227 vampires
' " @entity210 has long openly supported @entity33 , supplying it with weapons and training
like @entity33 , @entity210 's government does not recognize the existence of @entity2
@entity33 , the party in control of @entity5 , is considered a terrorist organization by the @entity6
@entity210 president @entity234 was quoted by @entity215 as saying saturday night , " zionists are at the end of the road both in theory and practice in all economic , political , military and cultural terms
" some @entity210 students and members of parliament held a demonstration in front of a @entity7 building in @entity248 , accusing @entity7 member nations of being silent in the face of " crimes " against @entity3
some demonstrators also condemned @entity36 , which has tried to broker agreements between rival @entity3 factions @entity33 and @entity94 , as well as between @entity3 leadership and @entity2
the @entity8 called for an immediate halt to violence
a statement issued by current @entity8 president @entity259 said the bloc " condemns the disproportionate use of force " from both sides
the statement urged the " reopening of all checkpoints and the immediate resumption of fuel and humanitarian aid deliveries
" the statement said " there is no military solution in @entity5 " and urged a lasting truce
@entity259 's president @entity276 , in a separate statement , expressed " great concern " about the escalating violence by @entity2 and @entity3
in @entity16 , @entity3 families and supporters protested outside the @entity2 embassy and chanted in unison : " five , six , seven , eight -- @entity2 is a terror state , " according to the @entity284
similar demonstrations were held in @entity286 , @entity287 and other cities
crush barriers were torn down and riot police were brought in to control the crowd of more than 500 people , @entity85 reported
the crowds waved @entity3 flags and held placards , some of which read " holocaust in @entity5 " and " no peace , no justice
