@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is due to visit @entity5 stadium in @entity0 wednesday on the second day of her landmark tour to @entity1
the visit to @entity5 is another significant symbolic gesture of reconciliation -- @entity11 troops opened fire on a crowd watching a gaelic football match there in 1920 , killing 14
on wednesday morning the queen met the @entity1 prime minister @entity17 and senior cabinet ministers at @entity19 as part of her state tour , the first by a @entity11 monarch since the country gained independence in 1921
@entity26 , editor of the @entity27 , said : " this is a triumph of really careful planning and shows a strong intent on both sides to make it work
" on tuesday the queen laid a wreath at the @entity35 in @entity0 in a joint ceremony with @entity1 president @entity37
the @entity35 honors those who fought for @entity1 freedom from @entity11 rule
during her stay , the queen will also visit the @entity45 in @entity46 and on wednesday evening , accompanied by @entity11 prime minister @entity47 , the queen will attend a state banquet at @entity49
the visit has prompted police to mount a major security operation amid threats of dissident republican violence
@entity55 has spent $ 42 million on security for the visit , according to officials
on tuesday scuffles between protesters and police broke out in central @entity0 , 22 people were arrested
the @entity1 military tuesday defused a bomb tuesday morning on a bus headed to @entity0
the military had stopped a private bus in @entity69 , evacuated the passengers and found a " viable device " in the luggage compartment , a spokesman for the @entity1 national police said
the queen 's visit is one that many in @entity1 believed would never happen , and marks the reconciliation between two neighboring countries that once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility
@entity55 's fight to free itself from its former imperial master is likely to form much of the narrative of the visit
there will be constant reminders of the violent past
the queen 's plane touched down , for example , at @entity90 , a military airfield named after @entity92 , who was executed for treason in 1916 for conspiring with the @entity94
his fate was sealed when the queen 's grandfather , @entity97 , refused to commute his death sentence
the @entity100 that the killing was a part of directly led to the partition of @entity1 in 1921
the majority of the island gained independence , but six of the nine counties of the province of @entity110 chose to stay in the @entity11 , eventually becoming the country of @entity1
in the late 1960s the conflict between mainly @entity114 unionists who want @entity1 to remain part of the @entity11 and largely @entity118 nationalists who want the @entity119 to be reunited with the rest of @entity1 exploded into a political and sectarian war , known as the @entity122
the ensuing three decades of violence between the @entity124 and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people , most of them north of the border , and while the @entity131 , signed in 1998 , effectively ended the conflict , suspicions remain
it is for this reason that the queen 's visit is more than symbolic
under the terms of the accord , terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons , and political allies of both sides now work together in @entity1 's power - sharing government
the change has been so rapid that , even as recently as the late 1990s , one journalist said he could never have imagined a state visit by the queen
@entity149 , who covered @entity55 for the @entity150 , said while some people on both sides still have their doubts over the visit -- for different reasons -- more significant is the peaceable language used in the debate
" some @entity118 will see this as @entity11 cementing its claim over the @entity1 territory of the six counties of @entity1 , " @entity149 said
meanwhile " the @entity114 will see the queen 's visit as ratification of a state that they believe is constitutionally hostile to any @entity11 presence in @entity1
so on both sides there 'll be qualms
" @entity170 , a pivotal figure in @entity1 history as long - time leader of @entity174 , the @entity124 's political arm , said the queen 's visit was " premature
" compared with incendiary language he had used in the past , @entity170 ' comment speaks volumes , @entity149 said
for instance , " when the queen 's cousin @entity180 was killed by the @entity124 in 1979 , ( @entity170 ) said it was an execution that was fully justified
" " when i was there the @entity124 cease - fire had collapsed , there was violence and killings , no surrender , no compromise
in those days there was no likelihood of the queen ever visiting
" @entity2 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .
