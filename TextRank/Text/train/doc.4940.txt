-- @entity5 's infrastructure was among the world 's worst even in the best of times , the country 's ambassador to the @entity3 said tuesday
" it was a catastrophe waiting to happen , " @entity9 told @entity0 from @entity10 shortly after a 7.0 earthquake leveled parts of his home country , cutting power and phone lines in the capital city of @entity17
" sadly , it has happened
" he called the result " a catastrophe of major proportions
" the capital city is surrounded by hills to which " little flimsy houses " were struggling to hold on , he said
@entity28 of @entity5 told @entity0 from the @entity30 section of the capital that the building in which his organization is based shook for about 35 seconds and did not weather it well
learn more about @entity5 , poorest nation in @entity36 " portions of things on the building fell off , " he said
" fortunately for us , our building remains standing and none of our staff were injured , but lots of walls are falling down
many of our staff have tried to leave , but were unsuccessful because the walls from buildings and private residences were falling into the streets
" in the capital , government buildings were damaged , phone service was spotty and electricity was out , except for people who had emergency generators , @entity28 said
the quake 's impact also shook the psyches of residents , particularly when aftershocks occurred , he said
" if there is another aftershock , there is a kind of wail as people are very frightened by it , " @entity28 said
" but most people are out in the streets and just kind of looking up
" @entity9 said he had spoken with secretary - general @entity72 , who told him buildings collapsed on either side of him as he walked along a street in @entity30
@entity76 , international relief agency based in @entity77 , spoke briefly with their person in charge in @entity17 before the line went dead
regional information officer @entity81 said the representative told them " it 's a total disaster
" she quotes him as saying , " i never felt anything like this
it was a major hit , and it was direct
" he told @entity91 their building was shaking but still standing , but the building across the street from them collapsed
he described a cloud of dust everywhere , and people moving into courtyards to get away from buildings
eighty percent of @entity5 's 9 million residents live under the poverty line and more than half -- 54 percent -- live in abject poverty , according to the @entity106
in 2008 , four tropical storms damaged the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sector , on which two - thirds of @entity110 depend , mainly as subsistence farmers
citing that @entity115 assessment , the @entity113 said in a report on its web site , " among the numerous factors explaining the extent of the loss of lives and goods are the absence of land use zoning and building guidelines , and comprehensive enforcement mechanisms
" the @entity113 report added @entity5 has no national building codes
former @entity3 ambassador to @entity5 @entity130 told @entity0 that @entity17 was particularly at risk because it grew rapidly from a population of about 250,000 in the mid- 1950s to more than 2 million today , all with little oversight
city planners had called for the surrounding hills to remain undeveloped in order to protect an aquifer
" that did n't happen , " @entity130 said
" people started building up those hillsides
" instead of building concrete structures , they built shanties , he said
" my fear is that they all fell down
