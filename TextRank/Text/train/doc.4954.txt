-- dr. @entity1 had stared death in the face many times , doing all he could against frightful odds to save @entity7 victims in @entity8
in his first extensive on - camera interview since contracting the virus , @entity1 recalled to @entity12 on tuesday how close he had come to being one more of the over 1,500 people the @entity15 says have lost their lives to @entity7 in the current outbreak
doctors never told him outright he might not survive as he lay in a bed in @entity20 , an ocean away from his family
they did n't have to
" i felt like i was about to die , " @entity1 told @entity12 's @entity22
" and i said to the nurse taking care of me , ' i 'm sick
i have no reserve , and i do n't know how long i can keep this up
