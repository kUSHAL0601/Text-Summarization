" some fans shared memories from decades past

" @entity45 's wife , @entity46 , and daughter @entity44 posted a message to the artist 's website regarding his condition on tuesday
" please send your prayers and love to him as he makes his way through this part of his journey , " his wife , @entity46 , and daughter @entity44 wrote in a message posted to the artist 's website
" thank you fans and music lovers who have made his life so filled with joy and celebration ... he has loved nothing more than to play , to fill the room up with music , lay down the back beat , and make the people dance ! he did it every time he took the stage , " they said
during an induction speech saturday at the @entity80 , @entity45 's former bandmate @entity78 offered his " prayers and love " for the drummer
born in @entity86 , @entity87 , in 1940 , the son of a cotton farmer , @entity45 rose to fame in the late 1960s and 1970s as a member of @entity13 , a folk rock group
his soulful , drawling vocals highlighted many of the group 's hit recordings , such as " @entity94 , " " @entity95 , " and " @entity96
" @entity45 , 71 , was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998
he fell on hard times as cancer took his voice and medical bills threatened his house
" you got to pick one -- pay your medical bills or pay the mortgage
most people ca n't do both , and i 'm not different , " he told @entity0 in 2010
so @entity113 , as the residence is known around @entity45 's adopted hometown of @entity38 , @entity112 , became the setting for what he called a " last celebration
instead , @entity113 became the center of an unlikely and unrivaled rock ' n ' roll revival
it was there that @entity45 regularly hosted the @entity122 , weekly concerts that attracted sell - out crowds and all - star support from the likes of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity130 's @entity129
the result not only paid the bills but also led to a creative resurgence for @entity45 , with his collaborations producing back - to - back @entity137 - winning albums : 2007 's " @entity139 " and 2009 's " @entity140
" " if i had my way about it , we 'd probably do it every night , " @entity45 said
" i never get tired of it
" @entity0 's @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .
