-- it 's typical for high school students to encourage their classmates in competition with " you guys are going to win
" what makes it different in the case of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity14 seniors @entity12 and @entity15 is what they won : the superlative of " @entity18 , " as highlighted in the school yearbook
and until the news went viral , the decision , says @entity10 principal @entity24 , " has n't really been a big deal in the school
" " i thought at this stage as we are now , it should n't be a news event
all the reactions are coming from outside
the yearbooks were distributed wednesday , and we did n't get any calls until someone posted it online , " @entity24 , whose school is about 65 miles north of @entity11 , told @entity0 tuesday
@entity15 , 17 , said he sees the honor as a great achievement and a turning point for their school
" at first we were n't able to run because for the title , they were only allowed to pick a boy and a girl , " he told @entity0
" but a bunch of our friends made an uproar , and they changed it
so now you vote ' student one ' and ' student two
' and i guess a lot of people voted for us and we won
so many people came up to us saying , ' you guys are going to win
' " a mutual friend introduced the two last year during a @entity59 visit
later on , they started dating
" i came out to my family a week or two after i started dating @entity64 , " said @entity62 , 18
" he was the one encouraging me to come out to them
" " i feel like both of our families always knew but i told my parents a month before we started dating , " said @entity15
@entity15 's father , @entity71 , agreed with @entity24 in saying that in this day , it should be no surprise that a gay couple won the " @entity18 " title
" i think of it as any other normal day
lots of people win ' @entity18 , ' " said the elder @entity15
" back in the day it was different races being together , so for me it should n't be anything , " @entity71 said
" he 's very excited that he won
" @entity15 , who has participated in plays at his school , and at a community theater , received a full scholarship to the @entity88 @entity87
@entity62 also will enroll at @entity88 's @entity87 in the fall
@entity90 , another of their friends , posted their yearbook photo together on @entity94 and said she got resoundingly positive reactions
" two of my best friends won ' @entity18 ' of our senior class , " @entity90 said on her @entity94 account
" first time in my school history a same - sex couple has even been able to run for this category , not to mention winning it
so proud of them , and my school
