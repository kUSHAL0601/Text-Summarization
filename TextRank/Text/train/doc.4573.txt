@entity0 -- relatives of a bar owner killed more than 30 years ago over a spilled drink said tuesday the life sentence given to a reputed mobster has finally brought them justice
@entity8 , 65 , was sentenced in @entity9 to life without parole plus 10 years for his 2013 racketeering conspiracy conviction
criminal acts from 1978 through 2011 included drug trafficking , illegal gambling and the 1981 double homicide of @entity17 and business partner @entity18 , according to prosecutors
they said @entity8 held key roles with the @entity23 organized crime family
" thirty - three years is a very long time to wait for justice
we have our closure , but we have been waiting for justice , " @entity17 's daughter , @entity25 , told the court shortly before the sentencing
@entity8 , wearing glasses and a blue jumpsuit , declined to make a statement prior to his sentencing
defense attorneys @entity35 and @entity37 said there will be an appeal
@entity8 has maintained his innocence , @entity35 said
@entity42 's long journey for justice in case @entity17 and @entity18 ran the @entity45 in @entity46 when they were killed the night of april 11 , 1981 , after a dispute between an alleged @entity49 associate and others in the bar over a drink spilled on his girlfriend
according to the @entity58 attorney 's office , the patron left the crowded bar and picked up @entity8 and a third accomplice
they went to the bar and gunned the " two innocent bar owners " down , authorities said
@entity8 , also known as " @entity63 , " went into hiding in the weeks after the slaying , according to the @entity66 statement , but would emerge years later to take an active role in the @entity49
@entity8 was charged in 1998 in @entity46 @entity68 with the deaths of @entity17 and @entity18 , but was acquitted of state charges after trial in 2002 , according to prosecutors
according to all accounts , no witness could identify @entity8
it was n't until @entity8 was arrested in january 2011 as part of a national sweep of 100 alleged members and associates of organized crime that he was brought up on the federal racketeering charges
during the federal trial in 2013 , an eyewitness testified he recognized all three assailants in the bar but lied during the state trial out of fear , saying " two men were dead over a spilled drink
i think that was reason enough to be afraid
" that eyewitness testified that he saw @entity8 point a gun at @entity17 's head and saw one of @entity8 's accomplices threatening @entity18 with a gun , according to a 2013 statement by the @entity66
@entity18 was shot in the head and @entity17 was shot in the chest when he tried to intervene , according to court documents
@entity17 's children and grandchildren filled the courtroom tuesday and embraced prosecutors following the sentencing
" it took too long , but we will take it , " @entity17 's widow , @entity108 , said outside court
" justice has finally been served thanks to the lawyers , the jury , and all the witnesses who testified
" @entity1 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .
