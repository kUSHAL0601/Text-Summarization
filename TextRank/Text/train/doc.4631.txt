-- for fans of @entity2 , 09/09/09 will mark a new invasion
the @entity2 will be made even more so when the remastered @entity2 catalogue is released in september
@entity5 and @entity6 have announced that as the date for the release of the entire original @entity2 catalogue , digitally remastered
that includes all 12 @entity2 albums in stereo , with track listings and artwork as originally released in the @entity15
the package will also contain the lp version of " @entity18 " ( initially released as a double - @entity19 in @entity15 , though available on cd since 1987 ) and the collections " past masters @entity22 " combined as one title
the release marks the first time that the first four @entity2 albums are being made available in their entirety on compact disc , and it also coincides with the release of " @entity2 : @entity31 " video game
@entity32 , executive editor for @entity33 , said the timing is genius in terms of marketing
" most bands , when they do a big project like this they pay for publicity , " @entity32 said
" @entity2 got paid for ' @entity31 ' and then they are using that for publicity to rerelease a catalogue
" blog : a @entity2 fan reflects on the news @entity32 pointed out that media have evolved tremendously since 1964 , when the band first burst onto the @entity54 scene with an appearance on " the @entity56
" back then , there were only three major television networks , and engineering of albums was much less sophisticated , @entity32 noted
previous rereleases have sold well in the past -- indeed , @entity2 albums have sold steadily for decades -- and @entity32 said he expects this one to do even better
" i think if you were to look at pure catalogue , old bands selling old albums , the @entity2 are the kings -- commercially as well as artistically , " @entity32 said
" a lot of [ music ] has been remastered better in the past 22 years , and remastering technology has come a long way
" @entity74 , the author of two books on @entity2 music and head of the web site @entity79 , said there has long been a clamor among fans for good , high - quality versions of @entity2 songs
" the technology that was available back then was very limited , and with the newer technology they are able to do far more with what they have than they have ever been able to do before , " he said
" for people who are plugged into ipods and the whole digital music scene , it 's going to be a lot better for them
" in acknowledgment of the more technologically advanced listeners , each cd will contain , for a limited time , an embedded brief documentary film about the album
the documentaries contain archival footage , rare photographs and never - before - released studio chat from the @entity2
the remastering project was four years in the making
engineers used de-noising technology and cleaned up glitches like electrical clicks and microphone vocal pops , so long as it did n't affect the original integrity of the songs
they also slightly boosted the volume levels
@entity118 , publisher of @entity119 , said the announcement of the release of the remastered recordings " is long overdue in the @entity2 community and for music fans alike
" he also said the quest to improve the original recordings is not new
@entity118 said bootleg releases over the years used rare and obscure vinyl pressings from countries like @entity130 and @entity131 to compile the best of the best recordings of @entity2 songs , presenting to the public a better sound that @entity5 could not offer prior to the remastering
" while the new remasterings will replace a library full of bootlegs of their commercial releases , there remains a massive market for their more obscure tracks , outtakes and live performances , " @entity118 said
the 14 remastered albums , along with a @entity149 collection of the documentaries , will also be available for purchase together in a stereo boxed set
a second boxed set , " @entity2 in @entity156 , " includes all of the @entity2 recordings that were mixed for a mono release
it will contain 10 of the albums with their original mono mixes , plus two additional discs of mono masters ( covering similar ground to the stereo tracks on " @entity166 " )
the mono " help ! " and " @entity169 " discs also include the original 1965 stereo mixes , which have not been previously released on @entity96
these albums will be packaged in mini-vinyl cd replicas of the original sleeves with all of the original inserts and label designs
even with the release date , what is old has become new
diehard beatle - ologists may take note that the release date could be viewed as a nod to the @entity2 track " one after 909 " from the " @entity185 " album -- or a reference to the @entity184 's " @entity183
" ( @entity186 , who was born on october 9 , occasionally talked about his fondness for the number 9
) @entity74 said making the music more accessible and attractive to a younger audience helps spread @entity191 to a new generation
" their music is catchy , memorable , interesting and listenable , " said @entity74 , who was a youngster in @entity193 when the @entity2 hit the scene and has been a fan ever since
" the time that they evolved their music was an interesting time and their music reflected that time
" @entity32 said the band has always captured fans from across generations
" the songs have lasted for a long time because they are great songs , " he said
" it 's just that simple
those are amazing , amazing albums
