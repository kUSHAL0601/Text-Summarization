@entity0 -- a company that makes toys to encourage girls to become engineers has backed down from using a @entity7 song in its ad
@entity9 had used a parody version of the decidedly misogynistic @entity7 song " girls " in a video featuring a trio of inventive girls who trade their tiaras for a toolbox
the company 's lawyers filed a lawsuit last week asserting their " fair use " of the tune , but wednesday its founders posted a letter addressed to @entity7 @entity25 and @entity26
" we do n't want to fight with you , " founder @entity27 wrote
" we love you and we are actually huge fans
" the song has been removed from the video , which went viral this month and gained millions of online viewers , she said
" when we made our parody version of your song , ' girls ' , we did it with the best of intentions , " @entity33 said
" we wanted to transform it into a powerful anthem for girls
" the company did not realize that @entity7 member @entity45 , who died last year , had in his will that he wanted his songs to never be used in advertising , she said
" although we believe our parody video falls under fair use , we would like to respect his wishes and yours , " she wrote
the @entity7 song 1987 " girls " has lyrics including , " girls , to do the dishes , " and , " her pants were tight , and that 's ok
" Ã‚ in the @entity9 version , the lyrics are synchronized with a " @entity64 " contraption -- a device over-engineered to carry out a simple task -- and altered to convey a more feminist message : " you like to buy us pink toys , and everything else is for boys and you can always get us dolls and we 'll grow up like them ... false
" " over the past week , parents have sent us pictures and videos of their kids singing with pride , building their own @entity64 machines in their living rooms and declaring an interest in engineering , " @entity33 wrote wednesday
" it 's been incredible to watch
" @entity33 , a @entity82 - educated engineer , has said her ultimate goal is to bridge the gap of gender disparity in engineering ; according to the @entity89 , women account for 24 % of the science , technology , engineering and math work force
she wants to " disrupt the pink aisle " and " get girls building " with her " toys for future inventors
" the video is one of four finalists in @entity104 's " @entity103 , @entity105 " contest
the contest winner will nab a multimillion - dollar ad spot during the @entity108 on february 2
