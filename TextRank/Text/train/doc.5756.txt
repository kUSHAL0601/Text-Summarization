-- @entity4 president @entity3 should leave office during the investigation into whether he was connected to three recent slayings , his 2007 presidential opponent said thursday
@entity4 president @entity3 has said he has no intention of giving up power over the slayings inquiry
retired gen. @entity11 , who lost to @entity12 in a runoff , said @entity4 is suffering its worst crisis since the democratic process began in 1985 after years of civil war
demonstrations will continue and anger will mount unless @entity3 temporarily steps out of the way to allow an unblemished probe , he said
" we want an impartial investigation , a transparent investigation , " @entity21 told @entity0
" the president must leave his post
" the crisis started monday with the surfacing of a video in which @entity4 attorney @entity29 said @entity3 , the president 's wife and a top aide would be responsible if something happened to the lawyer
@entity29 was gunned down sunday while riding his bike in @entity36
he had recorded the video last week
@entity29 was being threatened with death , he said , because he had blamed @entity3 and his associates for the april slayings of a prominent businessman and his daughter
@entity29 had represented the businessman
they were killed , @entity29 said , because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted
" it 's the time - honored tradition in @entity4 that if someone gets in your way , there 's likely to be a violent outcome , " said @entity48 , the @entity49 ambassador to @entity4 from 1996 to 1999
@entity3 took to the airwaves monday night to vehemently deny that he , his wife or the aide had any connection to the slayings
he promised a full investigation and said he would accept international help , asking the @entity63 to become involved
a @entity4 newspaper reported thursday that an @entity63 agent had arrived in the country in connection with the investigation
but @entity29 supporters say they do n't believe the @entity4 government can carry out an impartial and thorough investigation and want @entity3 out
@entity21 said vice president @entity72 could take over until the investigation is complete
" we are only asking that the state be strengthened , " @entity21 said
" if he does n't do this , we believe the situation will get worse
" @entity3 said in an interview tuesday night with @entity79 that he has no intention of resigning or otherwise giving up power
he blamed the deaths on unnamed people who want to bring down his government
" it is evident that [ @entity29 's video statement ] was written by someone who has been in on this plan to destabilize the government and for reasons that i do n't know , because i do n't know why mr. @entity29 mentions us in that video , " @entity3 said
for @entity21 and other critics , that 's not good enough
" the president has not wanted to confront this and has given evasive answers , " @entity21 said
" until the president confronts this , indignation will increase
" some analysts say @entity3 needs to get the nation under control immediately
" it 's a very worrisome situation , " said @entity48 , the former @entity49 ambassador
" the country is in very serious trouble
" there were rumors two to three weeks ago that the military might stage a coup , @entity48 said
" the security situation is out of control , " he added
@entity114 , a @entity115 analyst with the @entity117 consulting firm , calls it " a major political scandal
" @entity120 , director of the @entity121 , a @entity122 policy institute , agrees with that assessment
" it 's very damning for the president
very damning , " he said
@entity127 , a fiscal analyst and executive director of the @entity130 , said the upheaval could further tear apart a poverty - ridden nation trying to heal from a deadly civil war
the three recently slain @entity4 -- @entity29 , businessman @entity134 and his daughter -- came from the upper economic class
as a result , @entity137 said , many wealthy @entity4 are being " radicalized " against the government
likewise , he said , many poor and disenfranchised @entity4 also are becoming radicalized and are rallying behind @entity3 and the government
" i fear that this crisis will lead to violence and destabilization of the government , " @entity137 said from @entity36
" we all want justice
" @entity148 , a @entity4 who has lived in the @entity49 for seven years , rejects what he says are efforts to forge a class divide
" the powers that be are trying to make it a social issue -- the wealthy against the poor , " he said
" this is not a social issue
this is @entity4 are fed up
" @entity148 has personal connections with some of the key actors in the crisis
@entity29 was his wife 's law professor at @entity164 , @entity148 said
and he said he went to high school with @entity166 , the presidential aide @entity29 mentioned in the video
in his conversations with friends in @entity4 , @entity148 said , he sensed " a sense of desperation , of hopelessness
" he believes people are fed up
" they 're saying , ' ok
let 's not let this happen again and again and again , ' " he said
@entity137 , the fiscal analyst , holds out hope
the investigation , he said , will be handled by an independent attorney general who does not report to the president
and the probe will be conducted under the watchful eye of a @entity188 - @entity4 commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence
" that gives me more confidence , " he said
but @entity21 and others note that the attorney general , @entity196 , met privately with @entity3 on tuesday morning , the day after the scandal broke
the meeting was not disclosed until reporters uncovered it and questioned @entity199 on his way out
@entity3 's critics accuse the president of already meddling in the investigation
@entity3 and @entity199 said the meeting had been planned days ahead of time
" there is no interference in the investigation , " @entity199 told reporters afterward
@entity4 has " a culture of corruption , " said @entity48 , the former @entity49 envoy
a just investigation is necessary , he said
" until they fix it , they will limp along -- and that 's the good scenario , " he said
" they are in serious danger of becoming a failed state , if they 're not already
nobody is punished for anything
" @entity29 said the same thing in the video , bemoaning the " narcos , assassins and thieves " who have taken over the country
" those thieves are sinking all of @entity4 , " he said
" they kill people like dogs
" the lawyer 's niece , @entity235 , said her uncle learned to accept his fate
" he had many threats , " she told @entity0 en @entity240 , " and when he saw it was inevitable , he taped a video
" radio journalist @entity244 told @entity79 that @entity29 was supposed to detail his allegations monday afternoon on @entity244 's program , " @entity247 " ( speaking clearly )
instead , his funeral was held that day .
