-- movie audiences have always known the joys of in - seat snacking , but it took the theaters a while to come around
owners of nickelodeons and movie palaces refused to sell food until the 1920s , according to " shared pleasures , " a history of movie presentation by @entity15
munching on peanuts and popcorn during a show was low - class , they believed , associated with the circus and the burlesque house
the wonderful new art of the cinema needed a refined atmosphere , more like the concert hall than the carnival
of course , people ate anyway
as each new theater opened , candy stores and street vendors set up shop nearby , selling bags of treats to be smuggled past the ushers
it took the @entity36 to loosen the owners ' scruples
@entity40 's book " @entity41 " details the way movie theaters got into the popcorn business
looking for extra revenue streams , the theaters began leasing space to vendors : prime locations right next to the box office , or even " lobby privileges " for a dollar a day
when they saw the kind of profits the popcorn sellers were turning , they took over the stands themselves
the movies turned popcorn into a snack phenomenon : 5 million pounds were grown in the @entity63 in 1934 , 100 million pounds in 1940
the owners also realized that setting up candy counters and staffing them with high school students ( preferably female and pretty ) was an easy way to turn a buck , and all the new brands of packaged candy made their way into theaters
soft drinks showed up via the @entity74
after @entity76 , salesmen traveled the land , setting up soda stands at movie houses throughout the country
with more and more independent theaters opening ( a 1948 antitrust ruling forbade @entity84 studios from running their own
) , owners looked to the refreshment stands as a way to cover the cost of renting films
trying to sell more snacks , they instituted intermissions in the middle of films and commissioned cartoons of singing , dancing treats to push the goods
art houses , showing foreign films to an urbane crowd , began to pop up in big cities and university towns in the late ' 40s
as historian @entity104 points out in her 2001 study " @entity106 , " the new highbrow theaters tried to distinguish themselves from mainstream joints by serving coffee and pastries : more intellectual fare , apparently
the arty @entity113 chain even set up faux - @entity115 " street " cafes in some of its branches
in most of the country , though , the drive - in ruled
with more space available , the menu expanded : hot dogs , burgers , even barbecue and fried fish sandwiches were offered to car - bound audiences
( folks in @entity128 got pickles , which are still served there today
) the late ' 70s saw the death of the drive - in and the neighborhood theater as more multiplexes opened
on the food front , the bold invention of the era was snack counter nachos
introduced by @entity140 at a @entity142 game in 1977 , chips with gooey " cheese " soon moved from stadium to multiplex lobby
@entity147 's company , @entity146 , is still the leader in the field , selling orange goo and orange - goo - dispensing equipment to theaters from @entity153 to @entity154
another company , @entity155 , founded in 1992 by two business school graduates , also broadened the movie snack menu
they 're the people who brought those bulk bins of yogurt pretzels and gummy candies to lobbies everywhere
their original goal was to offer healthy alternatives to the usual snack counter candy , but they discovered that people were n't quite ready to give up the junk
@entity169 was on people 's mind in the ' 90s however : @entity173 report by the @entity174 broke the news that a large movie popcorn had as much saturated fat as six @entity178
sales dipped -- just a bit Â­ -- and many snack counters started using slightly more healthy canola oil rather than coconut
the latest trend is theaters offering " luxury " options : premium screening rooms with cocktails , wine lists and upscale menus
at the @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 , you can get $ 17 crab cakes to nibble while watching the film
@entity200 's @entity199 chain offers @entity202 mojitos and bottles of @entity204 ( straw not included )
it seems some theater owners are still hoping to create that refined atmosphere they longed for a century ago
popcorn , though , is not going anywhere .
