-- twelve cannons were fired in @entity2 , @entity3 , on monday to conclude a ceremony marking the outbreak of @entity6 100 years ago
@entity7 declared war on @entity9 after it invaded neutral @entity3 on august 4 , 1914
the declaration escalated a conflict -- sparked by the assassination of the @entity13 of @entity14 -- into a global war
about 16 million people were killed before the war ended four years later
@entity3 was a key @entity6 battleground
dignitaries including @entity20 , the @entity22 and @entity9 presidents and @entity7 's prince william , duke of cambridge , addressed those gathered in remembrance monday
prince @entity23 said the people of @entity3 had been among the war 's first victims , and their " resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great
" @entity3 's sacrifice and contribution had been pivotal to eventual victory , the prince said
" @entity3 's resistance in 1914 allowed the @entity36 to regroup and draw up the battle lines which became the infamous trenches
these trenches have left an indelible scar on your land ; they speak of the horrors of war but also of your forebears ' courage , " he said
prince @entity23 said recent events in @entity48 showed that " instability continues to stalk our continent
" but he said the fact that war was now " unthinkable " between the former @entity6 enemies represented at the ceremony " bears testimony to the power of reconciliation
" " we were enemies more than once in the last century , and today we are friends and allies
we salute those who died to give us our freedom
" the king of @entity3 laid a wreath to commemorate the dead before a bugler sounded " @entity67
" a young girl representing future remembrance then released a white balloon as a sign of peace and reconciliation before the cannon shots rang out
