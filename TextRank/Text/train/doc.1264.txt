barely a month after pulling off a smashing re-election victory , @entity2 @entity1 gov. @entity0 finds himself fending off a local scandal that has become an early stumbling block on his road to a run for president in 2016
and despite @entity0 's cries of foul -- he claims @entity12 are making a mountain out of a molehill -- all indications are that the @entity2 hopeful has nobody to blame but himself for his current woes
as he prepares to ascend to the national stage -- and the glare of the spotlight that comes with it -- @entity0 must change some of the funky , in - your - face combative style that serves him well in @entity1 but is likely to cause voters in places such as @entity27 and @entity28 to recoil in horror
democrats in the @entity31 are still using hearings and subpoenas to piece together the particulars , but the general shape of the controversy is already known
in early september , some serious mischief appears to have been done by close associates of @entity0 's who work at the @entity40 , a gargantuan $ 2.57 billion agency that controls the bridges and tunnels between @entity44 and @entity1 along with area airports and the @entity46
without notice to the public or the agency 's executive director , the @entity40 abruptly closed a set of local roads leading to the @entity53 -- the busiest crossing in the world , handling 100 million vehicles a year -- causing massive traffic snarls in @entity58 , @entity1
@entity12 believe the shutdown was an act of political retaliation because the town 's mayor , @entity62 , refused to endorse @entity0 's re-election
nobody is admitting guilt , and @entity0 calls the political - payback accusation " crazy
" but two political appointees at the agency who are close to @entity0 -- one is a childhood friend -- have resigned
" mistakes were made , " the governor acknowledged in an hourlong press conference
as local @entity12 demand e-mails , memos and sworn testimony , the national party swiftly pounced , releasing a two - minute video called " @entity0 's @entity75 explained
" the controversy will likely be long forgotten by the time the race for president gets under way in earnest , but it 's safe to assume that no politician likes to see stories with headlines that include words such as " scandal " and " payback
" the idea that @entity0 might have inflicted pain on an entire town to settle a political score with its mayor also plays into an unflattering image of @entity0 as a bully -- a reputation underscored by videos that show the governor berating teachers , journalists and town hall participants
@entity0 fans in @entity1 love to see him telling people off , but that appeal does n't necessarily translate to the national stage
in fact , it 's safe to assume that if @entity0 runs for president , those videos will resurface as attack ads that question his judgment and self - control
more importantly , the controversy takes some of the luster off @entity0 's case -- spotlighted in a recent @entity123 cover story -- that he , rather than fire - breathing tea party conservatives , can best lead the @entity2 to victory in 2016
a big part of @entity0 's appeal -- an image he has carefully cultivated -- is that he 's a @entity2 with proven ability to win over @entity12 and independent voters
a former prosecutor , @entity0 has built a case for his crossover appeal by pointing to his two victories in @entity1 , a state where @entity12 outnumber @entity2 by 700,000 and independent voters outnumber both parties
" maybe the folks in @entity146 , should tune in their tvs right now , see how it 's done , " @entity0 crowed on @entity141 this year , challenging congressional @entity2 -- and the @entity142 -- to follow his lead
@entity0 's much - publicized working relationship with president @entity150 , which infuriated some @entity2 , was another step in the same direction , as was his rounding up support from @entity12 officials -- an effort so successful that @entity0 's @entity12 opponent , state sen. @entity156 , publicly declared that " @entity12 political bosses — some elected and some not — made a deal with this governor despite him representing everything they 're supposed to be against , " which she called a " betrayal
" it could turn out that @entity0 's followers went overboard in the effort to round up @entity12 support -- and that their zeal led to the punishment allegedly visited on @entity12 such as the mayor of @entity58
that could turn @entity0 into a punching bag for national @entity12 and erode his crossover appeal
for the sake of his presidential ambitions , it 's in @entity0 's best interests to get all the facts about the bridge controversy on the table as quickly as possible -- and then begin a long - term makeover to ensure that his image remains one of a blunt , tough - talking guy -- not a petty and short - tempered bully .
