-- last week , president @entity1 traveled to a historic town in @entity3 to offer a vision of a revived @entity6 middle class
where @entity7 and slaveholders had once done violent battle , where @entity11 called for a " @entity12 , " @entity1 presented this challenge : " ( @entity15 ) hat 's at stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family , build a modest savings , own a home , secure their retirement
" this is what we all want -- republicans as well as @entity27 , liberals as well as conservatives
the issue here is bigger than just how to revive @entity6 economic growth
even during the years of economic growth from 2002 through 2007 , middle - class people did not share much in the benefits of an expanding economy
it 's easy to imagine that the middle class could likewise be locked out of the next economic expansion
@entity1 scorchingly argued that @entity26 and conservatives will not deliver for the middle class
but his own program is not exactly inspiring either
the president called for higher taxes on higher earners , with the extra revenues used to increase spending on education and to invest in government infrastructure programs
but there 's no reason to expect more education spending to translate into higher incomes for middle - class people
@entity6 expenditure on education doubled between 1992 and 2006 without doing much for the middle class financially
what would another doubling accomplish ? the @entity6 already spends more on high school education than any advanced society except @entity61 and @entity62 , and considerably more than such egalitarian societies as @entity64 and @entity65
as for increasing infrastructure spending , the president is kidding himself
smart infrastructure spending enhances productivity , which is always good
but @entity6 productivity grew handsomely between 1993 and 2007
the trouble was that the benefits of that productivity increase were almost entirely captured by a hyper - affluent few
why expect the next round of productivity increases to be shared more broadly ? realistically , the president 's @entity3 speech translates into a formula of higher taxes on the rich to pay for more spending on favored @entity27 public - sector constituencies
but what about the much larger private - sector middle class ? does the president have anything to offer those people -- aside from the promise of a bigger government that might hire somewhat more people to enjoy the superior retirement packages offered to government workers ? short answer : no. what would a serious plan to improve middle - class incomes and opportunities look like ? it would start by addressing the way in which middle - class income is drained off before it ever reaches the middle class
during the last expansion , the cost of labor to employers did rise
it 's just that virtually none of that additional money flowed through to raise wages
over this decade 's expansion , the cost of employing labor rose by an average of 25 %
none of this money reached employees
every dime was intercepted by rising health care costs
for wages to rise again , health care costs must slow
we saw that happen in the 1990s : hmos controlled health care costs , employees got raises
health care is such an important part of the income story that you could almost stop there
yet there 's a second piece : college costs
higher education costs have been rising more than twice as fast as inflation , faster than almost any purchase except health insurance
it was often to pay those rising costs that families accepted the home equity lines of credit and second mortgages that contributed so much to inflating the housing bubble
at the same time as reducing costs for middle - class families , actions can be taken to take to boost incomes
over the past two decades , the @entity6 has lost global market share , especially to @entity147
one of @entity147 's most important tools has been the manipulation of its currency , which it has held artificially cheap compared with the dollar
if @entity147 tried to gain global market share by subsidizing its exports direct from the @entity147 treasury , such subsidies would trigger @entity6 retaliation under global trade rules
however , global trade rules do not apply to subsidies created by monetary means
through this anomaly , the @entity6 has outsourced more jobs than it would have if @entity147 's currency had moved freely , like the euro or the yen
it 's time for the @entity6 to reconsider its casual attitude to monetary manipulation
a more expensive yuan would slow and possibly even reverse the flow of jobs across the @entity173
if the yuan goes up , @entity147 exports decline and @entity6 exports rise
more work is done in the @entity6 , meaning more jobs , spurring a higher demand for labor and higher wages
finally , the @entity6 needs to reconsider the way it finances @entity182 and the @entity184 retirement system
the payroll tax has become more and more important to @entity6 finances since 1980
before the crash , payroll taxes supplied almost 40 % of all federal revenues
these taxes fall heaviest on middle - income @entity6
president @entity1 's payroll tax holiday expires at the end of this year
as we debate whether to renew the holiday , we should be debating whether we can not finance the federal government in more creative ways , through taxes on consumption or carbon pollution , for example , rather than a tax on the first $ 110,000 of labor income
these are some major elements of a working program of middle - class relief
they may not do the job
but at least they start the job
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity213 .
