@entity1 's new president @entity0 took the oath of office sunday , replacing controversial president @entity4
@entity0 , 65 , a cleric considered moderate , won the june elections with reformist backing
he campaigned on a " hope and prudence " platform in which he appealed to traditional conservatives and reform - minded voters alike
he pledged to improve the economy and unemployment
and as a former nuclear negotiator , he vowed to reduce the high tension between @entity1 and the outside world by addressing sanctions related to @entity1 's nuclear program
the @entity20 congratulated @entity0 , and in a statement called his inauguration " an opportunity " for @entity1 to " resolve the international community 's deep concerns over @entity1 's nuclear program
" should @entity1 decide to engage on the nuclear issue , the statement read " it will find a willing partner in the @entity29
" @entity33 's prime minister @entity32 , speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting , said the president of @entity1 may have changed , " but the goal of the regime has not been replaced
" " @entity1 's intention is to develop a nuclear capacity and nuclear weapons in order to destroy the @entity33 , " he added
@entity1 insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian nuclear energy
fast facts : @entity0 a former commander of the @entity1 air defenses , @entity0 led three war and defense councils
he was national security adviser to the president for 13 years before @entity4 took office
he has three law degrees , including a doctorate from a university in @entity53
as president of @entity1 's strategic research center , he regularly publishes essays
the @entity57 is @entity1 's supreme leader
@entity0 will be a " far more powerful president than @entity4 would have ever dreamt -- or even , before him , anybody else , " says @entity59 , a professor of @entity1 studies and comparative literature at @entity62
" because his revolutionary credentials are absolutely impeccable
he 's very close to @entity57 " and to the " security and military establishment , " @entity59 told @entity67 's " @entity66
" still , he wo n't have the power to make a deal with the @entity70 on his own , says @entity59
" @entity1 is a very complicated regime consisting of security , intelligence , military and clerical establishments and a network
" @entity77 , who was a @entity78 correspondent in @entity79 for 10 years , says @entity0 " is not a reformist , even according to @entity1 standards
he had backed the violent crackdown against the pro-democracy student movement in 1999 and never formally aligned himself with the reformist camp
" also , it 's not clear whether @entity57 's " hard - line allies will allow @entity0 to introduce real change , " @entity77 , now with @entity86 's @entity85 , wrote in a column for @entity67
" the president sets the tone for domestic and foreign policy and can make room for more moderate voices in politics
but he holds little power compared with the authority that the constitution gives @entity57
if @entity57 is willing to end international pressure over @entity1 's nuclear program , @entity0 provides the perfect opportunity
" @entity0 : hawk or dove ? embracing a hard - liner label when @entity4 won the presidency of @entity1 in june 2005 , he was a little - known mayor of @entity79
the son of a blacksmith assumed office billed as a hard - liner -- a label he embraced with rhetorical gusto
two months into his term , in october , @entity4 called for @entity33 to be " wiped " off the map , repeating a remark from a former ayatollah
years later , he told @entity67 , " when we say ' to be wiped , ' we say for occupation to be wiped off from this world
" @entity4 speaks to @entity67 's @entity120 also in 2005 , he declared the @entity121 a " myth , " prompting condemnation by the @entity124
then , in april 2006 , to a crowd of dignitaries , @entity4 announced that " @entity1 has joined countries with nuclear technology " -- sparking the conflict that continues to this day
economy sours @entity4 created a furor when he flew to @entity132 to address the @entity133 on its opening day in september 2006
he took to the podium , defending his own nation 's nuclear ambitions and decrying the nuclear records of other nations
the performance and the headlines that followed set a pattern that would repeat several times over the next seven years
back home , @entity4 's time in office was marked by crackdowns and a economic malaise
in 2009 , he stood for re-election
officially , he came out on top , but the result was disputed
protesters filled the streets , and the @entity153 , a feared paramilitary group , cracked down
with thousands jailed and scores injured , @entity4 pressed forward
but political protests were n't his only concerns
from @entity1 rooftops , a view of protest and violence fast facts : @entity4 analyst : @entity4 seeks to remain ' political force ' later , as the price of bread and other staples rose , people again people took to the streets
@entity4 responded with riot police and finger pointing , putting the blame for the economic woes on international sanctions
while he was prevented from seeking a third term , he 's unlikely to willingly give up being a " political force " in the country , says @entity179 , an analyst with the @entity180 and the @entity181
while " the odds seem stacked against " him in that effort , @entity179 wrote in a column for the @entity184 blog , " no one seems likely to convince the president to go quietly into the political wilderness
