@entity0 -- the @entity3 government stepped up its humanitarian relief effort for @entity5 on friday , sending two c - 130 military transport planes loaded with supplies to neighboring @entity8
each aircraft carried three pallets of aid supplies , including 2,000 blankets , 40 rolls of plastic sheeting and 9,600 10 - liter water cans , according to a statement from the @entity17
the supplies , meant to help up to 2,000 people , will be handed off to @entity8 's @entity20 organization for distribution , the statement noted
the relief operation -- designed to help those who have fled the @entity5 violence -- is named @entity27 , @entity23 spokesman col. @entity22 said
@entity3 authorities are considering multiple ways to assist in the crisis , but are currently focused primarily on humanitarian efforts , secretary of state @entity28 told reporters
the @entity37 administration remains deeply " concerned with the ongoing violence ... initiated and perpetrated " by the government of @entity5 strongman @entity35 , she said
@entity39 noted , however , that there is currently " a lot of confusion on the ground " in @entity5 that makes it tough to understand exactly what is happening there
addressing reporters on @entity50 , @entity48 press secretary @entity47 reiterated the administration 's position that @entity35 needs to step aside
" col. @entity35 has no legitimacy and should step down and should cease all violence , " @entity47 said
" we believe that that would result in a more peaceful @entity5
" the violence in @entity5 escalated friday as pro-government forces took control of @entity60 , a city near @entity61 , according to state tv
one source reported the deaths of 15 people and injuries to at least 200 others
a doctor at a hospital in @entity60 told @entity1 " there is a river of blood " where the wounded were being treated
he described the situation as " very bad , " with the facility running out of medical supplies
forces loyal to @entity35 also clashed friday with opponents of the regime in the eastern city of @entity82 , opposition fighters and commanders said
roughly 200,000 people have fled the intensifying violence in @entity5 , according to the @entity85
the number of people trying to leave , however , has declined heavily as armed government forces have intensified their presence on the @entity8 border and on roads leading up to it , the @entity87 refugee agency has noted
a number of key congressional leaders have been pressuring the @entity48 to establish a no - fly zone over parts of @entity5 to aid @entity35 's opponents and ease the humanitarian crisis
@entity35 's " air defense systems are certainly old and it ( should not be ) a major challenge ... to impose a no - fly zone , " sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , asserted friday
while the administration has shifted additional military resources closer to @entity5 , it has refused to commit to such a course of action so far
@entity1 's @entity112 and @entity113 contributed to this report
