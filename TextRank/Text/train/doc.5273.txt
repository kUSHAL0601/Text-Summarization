-- if investing in credit default swaps or commodity derivatives does n't exactly fill your heart with a sense of wonder and excitement , then a product with a little more va - va - voom could be a surprisingly viable alternative : vintage cars
records have been tumbling recently for classic cars sold at auction
last week , a 1964 @entity15 went for $ 14.4 million at the " @entity17 " sale , smashing the previous record of $ 6.9 million for the same model
@entity20 's sold off 31 classic and concept cars and auto - related items for nearly $ 63 million in just over two hours at the auction in @entity25
over the past decade the average value of classic cars has risen by 430 % , according to @entity29 's @entity28
this compares to 273 % for gold and a comparatively meager 55 % for the @entity32 over the same time period
indeed , in only july a 1954 @entity34 was snapped up for $ 29.6 million , the highest price for any car ever sold at a public auction -- dwarfing the previous title - holder by $ 13.3 million
and just yesterday , @entity40 's 164 @entity39 was auctioned off for a cool $ 553,000 alongside a host of historic cars at @entity43 's , during a series of lots that netted the auction house a cool $ 27.6 million of sales
" the fact that a car was previously owned by a celebrity will more often than not push the value up , but of course it depends on who the celebrity is " said @entity43 's spokesperson @entity48
" the demand for vintage cars is rising , " she added
" along with jewelry and @entity61 art , cars are now in the top three collecting categories
" @entity63 is founder of the @entity64 , an independent investment research house that specializes in classic cars
he says that vintage motors offer a unique appeal , particularly in the wake of the financial crisis
" people have been more drawn to tangible assets over the last 10 years
classic cars are fun , you can drive them and they have become a lifestyle as well
it 's also a way to pass on wealth from one generation to the next
" the value of classic cars has jumped 39 % this year alone , according to the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) , which tracks the financial performance of 50 rare and exotic classic cars
however , there is a sense among industry experts that these growth trends will slow down
" i would be surprised if the demand and value can continue at the same rate over the next 10 years , " said @entity90 , editor of the @entity91
there are also risks to investing in vintage cars , as opposed to the more conventional alternatives , like bonds
" the big difference to mainstream investment options is the lack of liquidity
you ca n't sell your car next door , " @entity103 said
" it will take a lot of research and a long time to find someone to sell your car to for the right price
there are also slight fluctuations in trends , so it might be that at that time an @entity117 is n't as much in demand as a @entity15
" it 's also not a one - off investment -- there can be substantive costs involved in maintaining the car
" you have to look after them to keep them in good condition , especially if you want to keep driving , " @entity103 said
accordingly , @entity63 advises against throwing your money at a classic car if money is all you 're hoping for in return
" someone should n't go into the vintage car market for pure investment purposes , but have a passion for classic cars , " he said
" the most valuable return from owning a vintage car is the satisfaction that you have something you 're passionate about
