, is a care - worn , 1960s slab of a building , popular as part of @entity7 's largest arts center , but outwardly unremarkable
yet what happened inside on monday , the @entity9 premiere of documentary " @entity20 " , has for some made it more than a theater space and transformed it into a site of huge importance for the development of @entity9 's democracy
" that screening on monday night was a big , big moment , " says 54 - year - old @entity21
" there are deep wounds in our nation since 1965 and this movie is like a healing process
" as head of the @entity31 , @entity21 was instrumental in bringing the film , @entity34 's companion piece to last year 's @entity36 - nominated " @entity35 " , to a captivated audience of around 1,500 people
@entity40 's 2012 film helped open up public discussion about a troubling and little - spoken of period in @entity9 's recent history : human rights groups estimate between 500,000 to 1 million @entity9 were killed by military death squads during anti-communist purges in 1965 and 1966 that helped cement the " @entity50 " regime of @entity49
while " @entity35 " told the story from the killers ' side , " @entity20 " takes an unflinching look at the situation from the viewpoint of the survivors
the film 's protagonist is @entity60 , a 45 - year - old optometrist , who tries to understand why his parents remain so deeply traumatized by his brother @entity62 's murder in 1965 , and the culture of fear and lies he believes pervades his community and country
@entity60 's unflinching gaze when he confronts members of the militia involved in his brother 's brutal death is juxtaposed with the attitude of perpetrators and survivors in the film , and many @entity9 as a whole , who prefer to say the " past is the past "
" but the younger generation are more open - minded , " says @entity21
" i was only five years old when these events happened and i 'm still ashamed by them
" next year is 50 years since ( the killings of ) 1965
how can we prepare for next year ? how can we see the events more sensitively ? i hope it can be like when @entity87 came to terms with the holocaust and they had a healing process with each other
" after a multi-year investigation , the country 's @entity93 in 2012 declared the massacre a gross violation of human rights
yet @entity9 is still a distance from any official truth and reconciliation process
no one has been brought to trial for the alleged crimes
the attorney general 's office has not yet replied to @entity0 's requests for comment
many survivors ' families across @entity9 still live in fear of reprisals if they should speak openly against those responsible for the crimes
during filming @entity40 made sure precautions were taken should things take a turn for the worse ; a getaway car was on hand , no - one carried @entity120 , phones were data - free and in some cases @entity60 's family were on standby at the airport to leave at a moment 's notice
" it 's a terrible situation that @entity60 and his family had to move away like fugitives ( after the film was made ) , especially when he was just trying to create the conditions for forgiveness , " says @entity34
" but it shows just how far @entity9 has to go before it can be called a genuine democracy with rule of law and that because of the impunity the perpetrators and gangsters have @entity60 's family has to run away , when they 've done only the most beautiful and dignified thing
" for @entity40 , monday 's premier was the most important screening of either " @entity35 " or " @entity20 " ( which has appeared at a number of international film festivals ) , as it was hosted by @entity9 government agencies -- the @entity31 and the @entity146
while " @entity35 " first had to be shown at private screenings , even public showings initially had to have heavy security , " @entity153 " premier was publicly announced , proving to @entity40 , that a space is opening up for the country to continue to heal
in december community screenings will take place across @entity9 , and @entity21 , encouraged by the recent election of @entity157 as president , feels optimistic that the country can get over its " mental block
" " we are pushing hard for @entity157 ( @entity157 ) to see the film , " says @entity21
" we have a problem in our culture
it 's not just about 1960s for us , but how we as a country are connected to the rest of the world
" according to @entity21 the atmosphere on monday was only tense with expectation rather than from any safety worries , and two screenings had be shown as twice as many people turned up as could be accommodated by the auditorium
@entity60 was one of those present at the premier
" after watching the film and seeing the victims i felt sad , " says @entity21
" i then met @entity60 and i just cried
