@entity0 -- the @entity3 military said its forces opened fire on infiltrators while on patrol along the @entity9 border early tuesday , killing one of them
" the suspects fired at the soldiers , who returned fire , " a military statement said
" most of the suspects fled back to @entity9 territory , " except for the one who died in the exchange
@entity9 security said the shootout involved three bedouins smuggling tobacco into @entity3
" one armed @entity24 was killed by the @entity3 close to @entity26 crossing ... in @entity27 after @entity3 soldiers fired at the men , " according to gen. @entity30 , head of @entity31 , who also said two others escaped
border incursions are not unusual along @entity3 's border with @entity9
in august , militants crossed into @entity3 from @entity9 territory to attack civilian targets
eight @entity3 citizens were killed in the attacks , which @entity3 has said were the work of a jihadist group based in @entity42
responding to the attacks , @entity3 troops killed five @entity9 border guards while in pursuit of the militants
the incident strained relations between the two governments , with @entity9 suggesting it was recalling its ambassador in protest
after an investigation , @entity3 apologized in october for the deaths of the @entity9 policemen
a rare statement of regret was issued in the days following the shootings
the incident also follows this week 's reopening of a an @entity3 highway that runs along the border
the road had been closed for safety reasons since the august attacks
" wide - scale work was carried out in order to strengthen the defenses of the road , " the @entity3 military said
following the revolution in @entity9 and the subsequent increase of instability in the nation 's @entity74 , the @entity3 government has accelerated the pace of construction of a steel border fence that will run the 260 kilometers ( 162 miles ) of shared border
originally proposed as a method of stemming the flow of illegal immigration into @entity3 , the $ 350 million fence is increasingly being regarded in @entity3 as a necessary defense against lawlessness and what @entity3 says is the growing influence of radical @entity89 groups operating in the @entity74
construction is expected to be completed by the end of the year
