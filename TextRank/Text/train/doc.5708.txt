@entity0 -- the @entity2 and @entity3 are allowing convicted felons to serve in increasing numbers , newly released @entity6 statistics show
a @entity3 keeps a watchful eye in downtown @entity9
recruits were allowed to enlist after having been convicted of crimes including assault , burglary , drug possession and making terrorist threats
the statistics were released by rep. @entity17 , a @entity19 @entity18 who chairs the @entity20
he has given the @entity6 a month to hand over up - to - date details on the number of waivers granted , reports on how the recruits have performed and information about how the waivers are related to meeting recruitment goals
@entity6 statistics show the @entity2 granted 511 felony waivers in 2007 , just over twice the 249 it granted the year before
the @entity2 aims to recruit more than 80,000 new soldiers a year
the @entity3 -- which recruits fewer new service members each year than the @entity2 -- also reported a rise in waivers for felonies , with 350 granted in 2007 , compared with 208 in 2006
" there was a rapid rise in 2007 in the number of waivers the @entity2 and @entity3 granted to recruits convicted of serious felonies , " @entity17 said in a letter monday to @entity36 , the under - secretary of defense for personnel and readiness
" i understand that there can be valid reasons for personnel waivers and recognize the importance of providing opportunities to individuals who have served their sentences and rehabilitated themselves
" at the same time , concerns have been raised that the significant increase in the recruitment of persons with criminal records is a result of the strain put on the military by the @entity60 war and may be undermining military readiness , " he charged
the @entity2 defended its use of waivers as a response to a changing @entity66 society , arguing that only three in 10 @entity66 of military age " meet all our stringent medical , moral , aptitude or administrative requirements
" " today 's young men and women are more overweight , have a greater incidence of asthma , and are being charged for offenses that in earlier years would n't have been considered a serious offense , and might not have resulted in charges in the first place , " @entity71 of @entity72 said in a statement to @entity1
he said the @entity2 never issues waivers for some types of offenses , including sexual violence , alcoholism and drug trafficking
but the @entity6 statistics showed the @entity2 allowed 106 convicted burglars to enlist in 2007 , up from 36 the year before
it also granted waivers to 43 recruits convicted of aggravated assault that year , up from 33 a year before ; and to 130 people convicted of possession of drugs other than marijuana , a rise from 71 in 2006
it also allowed two people convicted of making terrorist or bomb threats to enlist in 2007 , up from one the year before
the @entity3 did not immediately respond to request for comment
the @entity102 reported a slight decline in felony waivers , from 48 in 2006 to 42 in 2007
the @entity105 said it granted no felony waivers in either year
