@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a former high school teacher who served a month - long sentence for raping a 14 - year - old girl , was released thursday from a @entity1 jail
@entity3 's lenient sentence and the judge 's comments about his victim sparked national outrage and protests
he wo n't be a free man exactly ; he 's on probation for the next 14 years , 11 months
according to court documents , that means he 'll have to agree to conditions like undergoing sex offender treatment , not going to places where children congregate and not having a cell phone with photo , video or internet capabilities
prosecutors have appealed the sentence , saying it is illegal , to the @entity30
the victim 's mother says she hope @entity3 will be behind bars again soon
" ( judge g. @entity34 ) made a mistake and i 'm disappointed
( 31 ) days , that 's outrageous , but the @entity30 stepped in
hopefully they 'll make it right , " said @entity37 , whose daughter , @entity38 , committed suicide before @entity3 went to trial
in the meantime , @entity37 told @entity2 's @entity44 thursday night that she wants to avoid the man who raped her daughter
" i hope i do n't see him
that would be horrible , " she said
" i did n't see him for the first six years
i did n't see him until the courtroom
" but she said someday , she hopes she will be able to forgive him
" i could be miserable the rest of my life , " she said , " but that would n't do my other kids any good
" @entity3 declined to answer questions from @entity2 as he entered and left a probation office in @entity0 on thursday
defense attorney @entity60 had no comment on the case , but has said his client contends the sentence imposed is lawful and appropriate
before suicide , raped @entity1 teen loved outdoors , poetry activists file formal judicial complaint on tuesday , the @entity1 and @entity72 chapters of the @entity73 and an activist group called @entity75 filed a complaint with a judicial review board , @entity2 affiliate @entity70 reported
more than 140,000 people signed accompanying petitions , the groups said
" if we ca n't get him removed from this , there is something wrong with the system , and i know people in the state will work to not get ( @entity34 ) re-elected ( next year ) , " said @entity81 , president of @entity82
the case drew widespread attention when @entity34 imposed a one - month sentence on @entity94 and made controversial comments about the victim , saying she " seemed older than her chronological age " and she was " as much in control of the situation
" @entity3 admitted raping the girl in 2008 while she was 14 and he was her teacher at her high school
@entity38 took her life shortly before her 17th birthday
the judge later apologized for his comments , and earlier this month tried to revisit his sentence
but the @entity110 barred him from a new ruling , saying he did n't have the legal standing to change a sentence
@entity34 said he did n't realize at first that the minimum sentence should have been two years
@entity34 's secretary said wednesday the judge had no comment on @entity3 's release
' we want the conversation to go nationwide ' there is one good thing about the case , @entity73 's @entity81 said : it 's brought renewed national attention to the critically important issue of violence against women
" we want the conversation to go nationwide , so that everyone will say this behavior is not ok in my community
i think everyone believes , ' in my town it ca n't happen , it should n't happen , i need to stop it , ' " she said
" and you can stop it
you can stop it by going out and spreading the word
" that 's why she sees a glimmer of hope in how much people are talking about the case
" i think as long as we know that it 's happening we can acknowledge it and we can do something to change it
if we do n't see it and do n't acknowledge it , we ca n't make a change at all , " she said
" so i think this is important
this is so sad for the mother , this is so sad for the community , this is so sad for our state and our country
" the legal process with @entity38 's death , the prosecution entered into what is known as a " deferred prosecution agreement " with @entity3
this meant that all charges against @entity3 -- who admitted to one of the rape charges -- would be dismissed if he completed a sex - offender treatment program and met other requirements
one of them was to have no contact with children
but the ex-teacher fell short of the agreement and prosecutors asked @entity34 last month to sentence him to 20 years
@entity34 ruled @entity3 's infractions were n't serious enough
" he made some violations of his treatment program , " the judge said
" they were more technical and not the kind you would send someone to prison for
" @entity37 said the pain of her daughter 's death has n't faded
" i think we just get used to it , so we do n't cry every day , " she said , but the tears still came
opinion : in @entity1 , a case study in rape culture @entity2 's @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .
