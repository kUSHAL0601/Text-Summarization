@entity0 -- @entity2 on friday denied accusations by @entity4 that a @entity2 navy vessel had put a radar - lock on a @entity4 warship near a group of disputed islands at the heart of a bitter feud between the two @entity13 nations
the @entity14 said in a statement , its first official response to the claims , that @entity4 officials had given out " false information " and " hyped up " the threat from @entity2
opinion : is @entity13 sleepwalking into war ? the @entity4 allegations this week have put a fresh strain on relations between @entity26 and @entity27 , which remain at loggerheads over who has sovereignty over the remote , rocky islands in the @entity32
the tensions have resulted in maritime standoffs and the scrambling of fighter jets in recent months
@entity4 currently administers the islands , but @entity2 has been regularly sending its own vessels on patrols in the surrounding waters
@entity4 prime minister @entity40 on wednesday described as " dangerous " and " regrettable " the actions of the @entity2 frigate that @entity26 says used radar to gather information on the location of a @entity4 destroyer in the @entity32 last week
that type of radar could be used to produce data needed to fire upon the @entity4 vessel

it also denied accusations that its navy put a radar - lock on a @entity4 helicopter earlier in january , saying that @entity26 's claims did n't match the facts
" @entity4 unilaterally released false information to the public without confirming the facts with @entity2 , " the ministry said
@entity26 unimpressed but the @entity4 government stuck by its account and expressed dissatisfaction with the @entity2 statement on friday
" @entity4 can not accept the @entity2 explanation and urged a sincere response from @entity2 on the matter , " foreign minister @entity72 said
the @entity4 foreign ministry summoned the @entity2 ambassador to @entity26 over @entity27 's denial of the radar incident
the @entity80 expressed concern earlier this week about the alleged radar - locking on the @entity4 ship
interactive : @entity13 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? " actions such as this escalate tensions and increase the risk of an incident or a miscalculation , and they could undermine peace , stability and economic growth in this vital region , " @entity87 , the spokeswoman for the @entity88 , said tuesday
the @entity80 has tried to avoid getting dragged into the island dispute , saying it does n't take sides on such competing claims of sovereignty
but @entity80 officials have admitted that the islands fall under a mutual security treaty between @entity106 and @entity26
the @entity4 call the disputed islands @entity108 , and @entity2 refers to them as @entity108
near them are important shipping lanes , rich fishing grounds and possible mineral deposits
competing claims disagreement over who owns the small , uninhabited islands has soured diplomatic and economic relations between @entity4 and @entity2 since september , when @entity4 announced it had bought several of the islands from private @entity4 owners
@entity2 was outraged , as were protesters who marched through several @entity2 cities calling for boycotts of @entity4 products and asserting @entity27 's sovereignty over the islands
some of the protests turned violent , and damage to @entity4 offices and businesses was reported
in december , the dispute escalated when @entity4 scrambled fighter jets after a @entity2 plane was seen near the islands
@entity2 ships have repeatedly entered contested waters despite warnings from the @entity137
@entity2 says its claim extends back hundreds of years
@entity4 says it saw no trace of @entity2 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity4 sovereign territory in 1895
@entity4 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers
the @entity4 surrender at the end of @entity150 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further
the islands were administered by the @entity80 occupation force after the war
but in 1972 , @entity106 returned them to @entity4 as part of its withdrawal from @entity158
tensions with @entity160 @entity4 was given an abrupt reminder of a separate territorial dispute on wednesday when its defense ministry said two @entity160 fighter jets entered @entity4 airspace near the tip of the northern @entity4 island of @entity168
the @entity160 jets left @entity4 airspace without incident after a little more than a minute , the ministry said
the incident occurred near a set of islands disputed by @entity26 and @entity176 since the end of @entity150 @entity160 officials denied their jets entered @entity4 airspace , the @entity160 news agency @entity181 reported
@entity1 's @entity182 reported and wrote from @entity0 , and @entity183 reported from @entity26
@entity1 's @entity184 in @entity27 contributed to this report .
