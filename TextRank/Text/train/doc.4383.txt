a @entity2 committee 's approval of a resolution authorizing military force against @entity5 gave some momentum to president @entity8 's effort to win overall congressional support for the effort , but conference calls involving members of his own party indicate that it 's still an uphill battle in the @entity14
with @entity8 in @entity16 and @entity17 trying in part to rally global backing to punish @entity5 for its alleged use of chemical weapons , his chief of staff briefed two @entity23 blocs -- the solidly anti-war liberal @entity24 and the @entity25
several members who participated in the calls indicated the administration still has a lot of work to do
" if i had to vote today , i would vote no , " @entity32 rep. @entity31 told @entity33
@entity31 noted he had multiple concerns before wednesday 's call , which occurred on the same day the @entity36 approved a resolution authorizing a limited military strike on @entity5
the administration says there is overwhelming evidence that @entity43 's regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack earlier this month outside @entity46 , violating global conventions against their use , further escalating a two - year civil war , and putting civilians and allies in the region at new risk
a key question @entity31 did n't dispute the evidence , but asked a question that others have posed over the past two weeks
" what is the @entity60 position -- do we react militarily when people get murdered with sarin gas ? do we respond when people are slaughtered in @entity65 when sarin is not used ? " he said
@entity31 , the former head of the @entity67 , said he 's willing to listen to a classified explanation , but the case has n't been made yet
" what form of slaughter is more repugnant ? " he asked
the @entity67 is scheduled to meet with national security adviser @entity73 in a closed meeting on monday , a caucus spokeswoman said
no doubt , @entity31 will hear from constituents on the issue when he holds a town hall meeting at home in @entity79 on thursday evening
although @entity8 has appealed to congress to act for the good of humanity , polls show that most @entity60 surveyed do not want the @entity60 to intervene in the @entity5 conflict , which the @entity86 estimates has claimed more than 100,000 lives
the administration , working with @entity89 , has said it is planning for a limited strike , which experts believe would involve cruise missiles
senior officials have said there are no plans to involve @entity60 combat troops , a restriction reinforced by the @entity36 resolution that has yet to be considered by the full chamber
another @entity100 who listened to the call , @entity103 rep. @entity102 , also agreed that the evidence was convincing that the @entity43 regime used weapons against its own people
but in a statement to @entity33 after the call @entity102 , who sits on the intelligence committee , said the information so far was helpful but not sufficient
" as much as i need to consider the scope and duration of any attack , i have many questions about its efficacy , " @entity102 said
" i want to know to know what evidence the administration can provide that this strike will denigrate the @entity43 regime 's ability to use these weapons again , what plans have been made for possible retaliation and a clear sense of the end game
" the @entity130 battle over @entity5 @entity131 a factor the @entity60 experience in the protracted and costly @entity131 war weighs heavily on @entity135 , and many are pushing to include specific limitations on the length and scope of any military mission
many members of @entity89 also remember the faulty intelligence that underpinned the @entity60 rationale for invading @entity131 a decade ago
one senior @entity23 aide who participated in the @entity14 call with @entity147 members said there remains a broad spectrum of questions about the need for military action against @entity5
but " for those that are on the fence the resolution has to be as limited and tailored as possible before they will vote for it , " the aide said
senior house democratic aides cautioned that it 's still premature to gauge the votes , and said the vast majority of @entity14 @entity135 are still undecided and asking for more information
a steady stream of rank and file @entity14 @entity130 have announced their opposition to a resolution , with @entity14 speaker @entity169 expressing support for a strike but making it clear it 's up to the @entity14 to secure the votes
the pressure is on for @entity23 leaders to convince a significant chunk of war weary @entity14 @entity135 to back the president
even within top @entity23 leadership ranks there are divisions
@entity23 leader @entity182 and @entity23 whip @entity183 support the president , and are in close contact with the @entity14
but the no. 3 leader , rep. @entity186 is not aboard yet
" issues of war & peace require thoughtful consideration
i reserve judgment on @entity5 until a resolution and more details are forthcoming , " @entity186 said in a statement released via @entity193
@entity198 chairman @entity197 , however , is now saying he is prepared to vote ' yes ' if the military response is limited
while @entity182 and @entity183 are n't formally putting pressure on members , they are soliciting input on the language members could support for a resolution
for the second time in two days , @entity182 sent a letter to @entity14 @entity135 urging them to attend classified briefings and review the report laying out the evidence on the use of chemical weapons
@entity182 was asked by @entity212 on tuesday if she thought she could bring her caucus into the ' aye ' column
" i do n't know
i think it would be important to get a majority in the @entity89
but i do n't know if it 's important how you would break it down
these issues are not really partisan , " she said
@entity31 was reluctant to characterize the breadth of opposition among his colleagues
" there is a great amount of skepticism floating over the @entity227 , " he said
more classified briefings @entity31 added that the support among party leaders in @entity89 for a military response is unlikely to sway fellow @entity135
two more classified briefings with administration officials are scheduled for thursday and friday
but most members are still out of town for the congressional recess and will not have a chance to review the evidence until another closed session set for monday evening , the first day @entity89 is officially back at work
but the issue has many @entity135 mindful of what 's at stake if they oppose their president
@entity31 said he was " invested in the success of president @entity8 " and wanted history to judge his presidency " more positively than negatively
" @entity102 also referenced history as she wrestles with her vote
" as a jew , i am mindful how the world stood by when millions of @entity253 people were gassed to death and feel an obligation to oppose such actions , " she said
" the question remains what 's the most effective way to make clear to the world that the @entity60 will stand against such atrocities
" how will @entity2 vote ? how will @entity14 vote ?
