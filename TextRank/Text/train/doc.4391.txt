-- secretary of state @entity2 was discharged from a @entity3 on wednesday , three days after she was admitted for treatment of a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain , the @entity1 announced
" her medical team advised her that she is making good progress on all fronts , and they are confident she will make a full recovery , " @entity10 spokesman @entity9 said in a statement announcing her release
@entity10 walked out of @entity18 accompanied by her husband , former president @entity10 , and daughter , @entity21 , for a brief period earlier wednesday afternoon
the appearance led to speculation about her release , which was announced a couple hours later
she had been admitted sunday , after doctors found the clot during a medical test related to a concussion she suffered in december
the secretary is being treated with blood thinners to dissolve the clot , which has not resulted in a stroke or any neurological damage
doctors expect her to make a full recovery
@entity10 's future ' as good as her past , ' docs say earlier , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity43 told reporters that @entity10 was in communication with aides and there was nothing new on her condition or treatment
@entity10 " has been quite active on the phone with all of us , but she also made some calls on saturday to a couple of foreign officials , " @entity43 said
those official calls came before the blood clot was disclosed sunday
the first , to the joint special envoy on @entity60 , @entity61 , lasted a half hour
the second was to the prime minister of @entity64 , who is also the foreign minister
" she has begun to pick up her regular phone contact with some of her counterparts , " @entity43 added
@entity10 , 65 , has not been publicly seen or heard from in more than three weeks since falling ill with severe stomach flu and a subsequent concussion that occurred when she fainted because of dehydration , officials said
questions also have been raised as to why there was almost a day 's delay in explaining the precise location of the clot and why she was administered an mri , which revealed the problem
@entity43 said officials have been " extremely forthcoming " about @entity10 's health

" asked how @entity10 's illness might affect her plans to testify on @entity92 about the deadly september terror attack on the @entity95 diplomatic mission in @entity96 , @entity97
@entity43 did not directly say whether @entity10 would appear
" she has said that she is open to going up to @entity98
we are working with them now on their schedule because there 's also a question of when they are going to be in and we will let you know when we have something to share , " @entity43 said
@entity10 , a former first lady , @entity3 senator and presidential candidate , does not plan to stay on for president @entity112 's second term , but prefers to remain until her replacement is in place
some senators have said they would delay confirmation hearings for her proposed successor , sen. @entity117 , until @entity10 has testified on the @entity97 attack that killed ambassador @entity120 and three other @entity95 .
