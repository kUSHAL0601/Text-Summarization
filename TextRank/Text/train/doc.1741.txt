-- when @entity2 burst onto scene in a black and white swimsuit in 1959 , she was considered a rebel who embodied both " the sensuality of @entity7 and the innocence of @entity9
" now , she 's returning to her " fashion model " roots in an updated version of her iconic zebra swimsuit , and not everyone 's pleased
@entity2 caused a stir when @entity16 and @entity17 revealed last week that she would appear in the 50th anniversary edition of its annual swimsuit edition , which hit stands tuesday
the partnership includes a promotional cover - wrap that will appear on 1,000 copies declaring @entity2 " the doll that started it all , " a four - page advertising feature inside the magazine and video outtakes posted online
the doll is also for sale at @entity31
the official @entity33 account tweeted about the campaign february 10
responses to the tweet foretold the ensuing controversy , with one person calling " unapologetic " an " ill - advised hashtag
" another person asked if " unapologetic " really meant # sorrynotsorry
a post on " @entity44 " blog , " the @entity2 , so your daughter can feel @entity47 , " underscored criticism of the partnership for using a children 's toy to promote sexualized images intended for adults
it further complicates @entity2 's legacy for parents unsure of whether to view her as a positive or negative role model
@entity16 , however , stands by @entity2 's " unapologetic stance
" " this is not a program targeted towards girls
as a brand that is always a part of the cultural conversation , @entity2 , for the first time , has an active voice in the debate with her # unapologetic stance
the goal of the campaign is to empower fans to engage and celebrate all that makes them who they are , " a @entity16 spokeswoman said
the 2014 swimsuit issues celebrates " legends , " and @entity16 said @entity2 is a fitting example
" as a legend herself , @entity2 has always been a lightning rod for controversy and opinions
posing in @entity17 gives @entity2 and her fellow legends an opportunity to own who they are and celebrate what they have accomplished
" for some , it works
as one person said in response to a question posed on @entity33 , " no little girl reads @entity17
it 's literally a doll in a bathing suit , calm down society
" for others , the issue was not so cut and dry
" when you look at the history of @entity2 and how she 's ' grown ' in career choices i believe she 's a positive example ... and quite frankly , a more positive image than the @entity17 models , " @entity100 grandmother @entity99 said on @entity33
" @entity108 is a toy but the ' skinny ' models tell society ... that a woman must be skinny to be accepted as beautiful ; a far more negative example than @entity2 , " she said
" parents need to remember they should to be the positive role in their child 's life , not toys or @entity119 or athletes
" but a growing body of research suggests that children are influenced not only by what they see in the media , but by the toys with which they play
" people who say it is just a doll obviously do n't realize how it shapes thinking while playing house , " nonprofit executive @entity126 said on @entity33
" if the image of what ( you 're ) imagining yourself as is never attainable and is billed as what to strive for , you 'll always be disappointed
" her comments echo why many of the campaign 's critics saw something especially " creepy " -- or tone deaf -- in placing a toy intended for children in the pages of a magazine targeting adults
" i am # unapologetic for being grossed out by @entity16 's desperation
pairing up with @entity17 to put @entity2 on a cover mag ? # yuck , " digital strategist @entity148 said on @entity33
@entity151 and the @entity17 swimsuit edition have both been accused of promoting idealized beauty in their own ways
for many , the campaign was problematic because they say the swimsuit edition objectifies women and promotes a homogenous view of beauty
" it 's actually kind of perfect , " said @entity162 professor @entity161 , a feminist and media critic
" @entity2 is the perfect model for the @entity17 swimsuit issue
it 's always been about celebrating conventional definitions of attractiveness for women , and @entity2 is an icon of idealized femininity
" both @entity2 and the swimsuit issue have been making women and girls feel inadequate for decades
it 's a perfect partnership
" others took issue with blurring the line between women as objects and actual plastic objects
" yes , the swimsuit edition is made up entirely of hypersexualized images of women , but this pairing blurs a new line
@entity2 is not a woman , she 's an inanimate object
juxtaposing her alongside real women as though the two are indistinguishable is dehumanizing , and in a literal sense , objectifying , " said @entity192 , editor - in - chief of @entity193 , an online magazine that focuses on culture and gender roles
it also comes at a time when many are demanding representations of women without airbrushing or @entity203 , she said
" featuring a plastic doll as an object of admiration and desire feels like a slap in the face , " @entity204 said
throughout the controversy , @entity16 has remained " unapologetic , " citing @entity2 's 150 careers , her turns in 26 animated movies and partnerships with renowned fashion designers as evidence that you can be " capable and captivating
" but nobody is thinking about @entity2 's career trajectory or its positive examples when she 's wearing a one - piece in @entity17 's swimsuit edition , said @entity226 professor @entity225 , author of " men speak out : views on @entity229 , @entity230 , and @entity231
" " i would never want to deny anyone love for @entity2 , " she said , " but my concern is when we use her to present this hyper - sexualized model of beauty
" after all , ceo @entity2 and dr. @entity151 were n't the dolls appearing in @entity17
" when you look at how the lives of women have changed since the doll originally launched , the choice strikes me as particularly tone deaf in 2014 , " said @entity204 , of @entity193
the fact that " the version they want to focus their marketing blitz on is a sexy bikini @entity151 tells us something
" what do you think of @entity2 's appearance in the @entity17 swimsuit edition ? have your say in the comments , on @entity260 or on @entity263 's @entity262 page !
