-- when @entity2 revealed the " consumer preview " of @entity4 on wednesday , it did n't just give the world a glimpse at a new os — it also showed us that it can be a leader in touch - based user interface design
yes , @entity2 's new tablet @entity11 is n't merely utilitarian
it 's actually innovative , and even cool
and in some ways it trumps the best that @entity17 and @entity18 currently have to offer in @entity19 and @entity20 , respectively
here are five of our favorite new @entity4 features
picture password we 've known about @entity2 's picture password feature in @entity4 since its developer preview was unleashed in mid-september
but now that we 've had a chance to give it a spin , we can definitely say it 's a fun , convenient alternative to other system unlocking methods
in a nutshell , you choose a photo for your lock screen , and then define three touch gestures to draw on top of the photo in order to unlock your device
when @entity2 first detailed picture password , some were skeptical : wo n't evil hackers be able to figure out your gesture - based password based on the smudges you leave on the display ? in a blog post , @entity2 said no : " because the order of gestures , their direction and location all matter , it makes the prospect of guessing the correct gesture set based on smudging very difficult even in the completely clean screen case , let alone on a screen that sees regular touch use
" in that same blog post , @entity2 provided a detailed mathematical explanation of why a picture - based password is every bit as secure , if not more so , than a pin - based one
and independent security experts agree that the likelihood of someone being able to decipher the intent of smudges on your device is slim to none
of course , character - based passwords and number - based @entity73 are an old standby
@entity17 uses four - number passcodes in @entity19
they 're quite secure , but not particularly innovative
@entity18 is more creative with its unlock security , offering a facial recognition - based unlocking feature in its @entity20 4 @entity77 , however , has proven not to be so secure
in fact , it can be defeated if you hold up a picture of the @entity20 device owner at the right distance from the display
easy gesture - based app switching in the @entity77 version of @entity20 , @entity18 has added a " @entity93 " feature that pulls up a listing of most frequently used apps when you click the system bar icon
but in @entity4 , switching between open apps is much more intuitive and easy : a swipe from the left edge of the device will immediately pull up the last app you used ( assuming it 's still open in a multitasking state )
it 's a natural gesture , and one you 'll rarely use by accident
and best of all , it 's fast — like channel surfing for the tablet era
and how 's this for clever : if you know you have a large number of apps open , you can simply swipe back and forth on the edge of the screen , and up pops a vertical array of preview windows revealing all your running programs ( see screenshot above )
from here , you can tap on a preview to jump to a specific app. again : another solution that 's easy , quick and elegant
in the @entity122 version of @entity19 , you 're given two strategies to jump between apps
most people will double - tap the home button to reveal a lineup of icons of all open apps
from there , a simple icon tap will jump to the new app. that 's the popular method
but @entity132 5 for @entity122 also lets you swipe from open app to open app , much like the method in @entity4
but there is one hitch in the @entity132 approach : you have to use a full four fingers to execute the swipe
compared to the @entity4 gesture , it 's just not that natural
fat fingers are n't a problem one problem many mobile users suffer is that onscreen keyboards are n't designed for a variety of hand and finger sizes
this is typically less of a problem on tablets , which usually have enough screen real estate to offer accommodating keyboards
nonetheless , if you plan on using your tablet two - handed , typing with your thumbs , typing on a tablet is n't so easy
@entity4 offers a solution : it provides a split - screen keyboard so you can type with your thumbs
but wait , you say — @entity17 already does this in @entity19
this is true , but @entity4 goes one step further : you can adjust key size in the @entity4 split - screen keyboard
you have three sizes to choose from , so if you 've got the petite hands of a five - year - old , you can type on the small setting , and if you 've got manly man hands , you can increase key size to large
it 's not an insanely revolutionary feature , but little @entity11 nuances like this make @entity179 8 so appealing in total
@entity181 , fullscreen app experiences @entity179 8 also innovates with a unique , tablet - optimized approach that eliminates distracting " chrome " — in other words , all those busy interface elements that can junk up a desktop or app interface
in fact , it 's an @entity19 - wide theme of @entity4 ′ s @entity11
there are no menu bars , task bars , or navigational buttons permanently pinned to the display
in many @entity132 apps , you 'll find navigational buttons that persist across the app 's entire user experience
and even for apps that do n't do this , you 'll often still see that thin bar at the top of the screen that shows data connection strength , the time , and battery level
these are the very same elements that are locked to the @entity132 home screen
the case is similar ( and arguably worse ) in @entity77
you 've got your three virtual navigation buttons at the bottom of the display that are persistent across the @entity11
you also often have a bar across the top of the screen ( just like in @entity19 ) that displays battery status , time , and icons that link to other information
@entity179 8 does away with all of this
to see the time , battery strength and data connectivity , you swipe open your charms menu
once you 're done looking at these simple reports , you touch anywhere on the screen , and the @entity230 menu disappears
when i was younger , i was obsessed with knowing the time , so the new @entity4 approach would have driven me nuts
but now it 's liberating to keep the clock out of view — until i actually need it
just check the time when you need to , and enjoy a much less busy user interface for 99 percent of your time on the tablet
metro apps can luxuriously take up your tablet 's full screen , and in cases where there 's photo or video involved , that 's fantastic
home screen style and utility every major mobile os provides a certain degree of personalization in what you see in your home screen
in @entity19 , you can rearrange your home screen app icons so you can put your favorite ones front and center
in @entity20 , you can organize the placement of app icons , and also add widgets that display real - time information , making the home screen both personalized and a source of useful information
however , @entity20 widgets tend to have their own developer - specific themes and designs , so when they intermingle on your home screen , the resulting arrangement may look busy and inconsistent like a chaotic patchwork quilt
in @entity4 , however , you 'll find a happy medium between the tidy organization that @entity132 provides , and the freedom and utility of the @entity20 home screen
in @entity4 , app icons are live tiles , either square or rectangular in shape , but always consistent in their basic look and feel
but live tiles also update with new information in real time , just like an @entity20 widget
for example , the mail app provides a constant refresh of your latest message headers
you can organize live tiles in whatever order suits you best
in the screenshot above , we put the calendar , mail and weather apps on the far left so we could glean that information with a single downward glance
