-- selling smartphone accessories is all about being in the right place at the right time
when outfitting a shiny new mobile device , the vast majority of people pick up a new case and other add - ons the same day they buy the phone , or within the first three months
for @entity12 accessory makers , this pairing presents a problem : @entity12 does n't publicly share device measurements ahead of time , so manufacturers have to either wait until a product announcement to start making their products , potentially missing out on sales , or take the more common route of using unofficial leaks and information from factories
the new @entity24 goes on sale this friday , just nine days after being announced by @entity12
the device is taller and thinner , and sports a brand new port that wo n't fit older charging cords or devices such as speakers
iphone 5 pre-order shipping dates pushed back , likely due to demand for consumers upgrading to the new @entity24 , this means spending money to replace the obsolete cases , cords and speakers
for accessories makers , it means an opportunity for more sales
smartphone accessories are a lucrative business , and @entity24 owners are predictably big on pampering their devices
the @entity24 accounts for $ 6 billion of the $ 20.8 billion global smartphone - accessories market that 's forecast for 2012
the average smartphone owner spends $ 56 on add - ons per device
" there are over a billion handsets shipped every single year , and every single one of them drives accessory purchase , " said @entity50 , senior analyst for mobile devices at @entity52
the major players all know the key to getting their products into customers ' hands is already being on the shelves when they buy a new phone
for example , 75 % of @entity64 sold will have a case purchased for them at some point
of all smartphone cases sold across brands , 38 % are purchased at the same time as the phone , and 36 % are purchased in the first three months , according to @entity52
a select number of companies are lucky enough to be on the inside , privy to details directly from @entity12 before a major product announcement
they are briefed on specifications -- likely after signing hundreds of pages of non-disclosure agreements -- so they can start production on new compatible accessories in advance
@entity12 even has a special program called " @entity89 " for designers and manufacturers making accessories that use licensed components
they sometimes get access to specs in advance and can label their products as @entity12 approved
for this release , @entity12 teamed up with speaker company @entity95 , among other third - party manufacturers
other accessories makers have to either wait or turn to back - channels
leaks have suggested that factories in @entity101 that specialize in making @entity24 and @entity103 accessories have dependable specs and mock - ups of the final @entity12 products months in advance
hands on with the new @entity24 these factories will create cad files ( a digital technical drawing ) or detailed plastic molds of unannounced products , complete with cut outs and details where the buttons and ports are located
designers can use these tools to create new products
companies use this information to varying degrees in order to be prepared for a product launch
while the reliability of the leaks has increased since the first @entity24 came out in 2007 , they are not guaranteed , and some companies remain nervous about taking a chance on unofficial information
" that 's not the way that we operate , " said @entity132 , ceo of @entity133 , a @entity134 - based maker of @entity12 - related accessories
" we 'll get product when it hits the store , we 'll be in line with everyone else
" @entity133 did n't start production on new cases until immediately after @entity12 's announcement , @entity132 said
however , the company did use information , such as the leaked phone specs in the tech press , to prepare as much as possible in advance so that cases would be in stores quickly
the company designed new cases for the taller shape , and even produced and photographed physical prototypes the month before @entity12 's event
for the @entity24 , an advance team was sent to the factories in @entity160 , standing by to start production , and the entire company hopped on a @entity164 call to follow @entity12 's announcement live september 12
by that afternoon , a press release was sent out announcing the company 's new @entity24 cases
it hopes to have products ready in three to four weeks
" soft goods " like cases are easier to turn around , and the companies have had a lot of practice over the years
but for hardware makers , the new port was a challenge
@entity179 makes popular @entity24 and @entity103 accessories such as clock radios and speakers
the company would n't say if it had any official information ahead of the @entity24 announcement ( on its site it says its products are @entity89 - compliant ) , but did acknowledge that it has been busy
" when we anticipate a major product change , even months before an announcement is made , we brainstorm various options and even begin to expedite basic engineering modifications , " @entity188 , ceo of @entity179 , said in an e-mail
the company usually takes 7 to 9 months to ship new products , but says this advance work shaves two to three months off that cycle
@entity179 plans to start selling new products in early 2013
factories do n't wait to snag a customer to start producing products , either
they will pre-design and even start production on accessories before @entity12 goes public with a new device
then , they 'll try to shop those goods around to big box retailers like @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , as well as to individual brands that will buy up inventory and then add their own logo
@entity12 's secrets are n't so secret anymore , and that 's @entity217 over the years , rumors and leaks about unreleased @entity12 products have become more common
@entity12 devices are created by a porous network of third - party factories and employees that even the strongest of non-disclosure agreements ca n't always completely control
snippets of information travel between factories or even units of the same company
most factories are n't in a monogamous relationship with @entity12 or the approved third - party vendors with access to advance specs , and may also make products for other companies
while @entity241 factories have received the most attention ( largely for labor issues ) , that 's just one in a large network of suppliers @entity12 uses
in its 2011 list of @entity12 suppliers , @entity12 named 97 companies it contracts to create raw materials and manufacture and assemble products
many of those companies only handle one small detail , like providing the nuts and bolts that are used in @entity64
others produce more accessories specifically for @entity12 , like @entity261 did on the @entity103 's @entity262
navigating the world of factories and rumors is essential to companies competing for those early accessory dollars
but even if it is n't ready by friday 's launch date and the surge of new iphone 5 purchases , they are n't out of the game
they still have the global roll out of devices to look forward to , and the process could begin again if @entity12 releases the rumored smaller @entity103 this fall
new @entity277 sync with @entity64 , @entity278 via @entity279
