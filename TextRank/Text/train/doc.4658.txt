@entity0 -- the @entity2 are coming , the @entity2 are coming -- to @entity3 ? by subway ? @entity5 has paid $ 300 million for the naming rights to the @entity8 arena
@entity0 's struggling @entity9 has sold the naming rights to the second - busiest subway stop in @entity3
the @entity12 will now have the name of a @entity2 bank , @entity5 , added to it
several subway riders are outraged that @entity5 has purchased the naming rights to this subway stop , which sees about 10 million people go through it each day
one straphanger said , " a @entity20 should n't be the name of this train station ; it 's something that belongs to the public domain
" another said , " it 's just everywhere we go , everything we do , it 's just branding , branding , branding
" renaming the @entity12 - @entity34 is tied to the construction of @entity36 , the new sports arena for the @entity38 's @entity8
@entity5 is paying developer @entity39 $ 300 million for naming rights to this arena
@entity44 , in a separate deal , will be paying the @entity9 $ 200,000 a year for the next 20 years to rename this commuter hub
authority press secretary @entity46 said , " like transit systems all over the @entity33 and around the world , we are facing budget deficits
" in an effort to bridge the authority 's $ 1 billion deficit , the transit giant that oversees the operation of the city 's subways , buses and rail lines wants to follow the @entity5 example with stations throughout the system
though the @entity12 - @entity34 subway station is the first in @entity0 for which naming rights have been sold , across the country , there have been several cases of public transportation systems using naming rights to increase revenue
in 2003 , the @entity72 monorail system signed a 12 - year , $ 50 million deal with @entity74 to put its name on the station in the @entity77
the @entity78 sold station names to two hospitals for $ 1.1 million a year
internationally , @entity82 's roads and @entity83 has been selling the naming rights of 23 metro stations
however , not all naming rights deals are successful
in 2001 , the @entity87 tried to raise $ 22 million by auctioning the naming rights to four historic " t " stations
reassuring the public that there are certain lines they wo n't cross when it comes to renaming stations of historical value , @entity46 said , " it 's a very clear line there , and we want to be as open as possible , but we 're not sort of selling the shop here
