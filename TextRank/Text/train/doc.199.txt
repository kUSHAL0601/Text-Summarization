@entity8 , whose company is based in @entity67 , @entity68 , has appeared on a variety of national programs , including @entity0 's " @entity71
" in that appearance , @entity8 was about to address 3,000 people in @entity74 , @entity5
asked what he thinks about critics of his teachings , @entity8 told @entity71 : " well , you know , it 's interesting , @entity71 , because any time a new idea comes to the fore , it goes through three phases
then it 's violently opposed
and then it 's finally accepted as self - evident , normally after the opposition dies
" @entity22 advertises itself as " a place to relax and heal ... where powerful earth energies are present and active
" it was founded in april 2002 by @entity90 and @entity91 , both of whom are teachers and counselors there
