-- @entity1 announced plans to disrupt web streams of tuesday night 's @entity4 in protest of various @entity7 administration policies
in a posting on one of its web pages , the group claimed it would target live streams of the speech , to be broadcast on the official @entity15 site as well as many major news websites , including @entity0
television feeds of the speech were n't mentioned
however , the attack did n't appear to happen
none of the major news feeds or the official @entity15 site showed any signs of disruption or delay during the speech
" the @entity27 , and the @entity28 will face an @entity29 tonight
we will form a virtual blockade between @entity32 and the @entity33 , " the group declared earlier in the day
@entity1 is a loosely organized collective , and the claims of its purported members can be hard to verify
but a handful of prominent @entity39 accounts associated with @entity1 , which have in the past debunked or downplayed statements made in the name of the leaderless movement , appeared tuesday to support the threat
the @ @entity46 account , with more than 877,000 followers , tweeted a news story about the effort shortly before 4 p.m. et and urged followers to " hijack " the @entity39 hashtag # sotu -- which users will presumably use to follow the speech
the people behind the account also offered an alternate hashtag -- # @entity58 -- for supporters
during the speech the same account tweeted " no sign of an @entity63 so far other than @entity65 hashtag hijacking
" while there were some @entity1 tweets using the # sotu hashtag , they seemed largely lost in the noise of regular people commenting on and live - tweeting the speech
@entity1 said it was protesting a list of beefs it has with the @entity7 administration , including cybersecurity legislation
with the support of @entity7 , senators plan to reintroduce the @entity80 , or @entity80 , on wednesday
the bill attempts to address cyberattacks by increasing the sharing of information between private companies and the @entity86
it was killed in the @entity88 last year amid concerns about privacy and lack of oversight
president @entity7 issued an executive order on tuesday dictating cybersecurity standards for industries with vulnerable infrastructure , such as transportation and power
like @entity80 , the order will promote the sharing of information between private companies and the government
the government wants to use that data to better address future cyberattacks , but detractors are concerned about privacy
anonymous objects to such sharing , saying it would turn " private companies into government informants
" the group 's call to action also mentioned the recent death of internet activist @entity116 , the @entity117 , the use of military drones , @entity120 and warrantless wiretapping
taking on major news sites and the @entity15 site was ambitious
@entity1 has announced big plans in the past , such as shutting down @entity125 , without following through
@entity0 's @entity126 contributed to this story .
