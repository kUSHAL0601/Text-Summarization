police killed a suspected militant leader in a shootout in @entity5 's restive republic of @entity6 , state media said tuesday , amid increasing security concerns ahead of the @entity8 in @entity9
it 's also emerged that @entity5 authorities are hunting two more ' black widow ' suspects -- a notorious type of terrorist that 's emerged in @entity5 's clashes with @entity18 separatists
the latest incidents have fueled debate over security at @entity9 , despite assurances from @entity5 president @entity23 that @entity5 will do its utmost to keep the @entity25 secure
there have been years of unrest linked to an @entity29 insurgency in @entity6 and the @entity30 , and @entity29 militants have vowed to strike at the @entity25
@entity5 terrorism officials named the suspected militant killed tuesday in @entity6 as @entity34 , state news agency @entity35 reported
earlier , the news agency said @entity5 special forces were engaged in two operations in @entity6 , which lies about a 12 - hour drive from @entity9 on the other side of the @entity41
security forces killed three more suspected militants in @entity6 on monday , it reported
' black widows ' meanwhile , a flier handed out by security forces to hotels in @entity49 , southeast @entity5 , names three women it says could carry out a suicide attack planned by militant groups between january 21 and 24 , during the @entity55
one of the three , @entity56 , was killed in a gun battle over the weekend in @entity6 in which seven militants reportedly died
she had been trained to be a suicide bomber , @entity35 cited terrorism officials as saying
the other two are named as @entity63 and @entity64
the pictures on the flier show two of the three women in @entity70 headgear
but its text warns that the women may not be dressed that way
" suspected terrorists may use regularly clothing without any @entity70 elements , e.g. no long dresses , no hijab , which makes it easier to blend into a crowd , and makes it easier to get access to large gatherings without being noticed , " it says
@entity9 suspect police have also handed out fliers at @entity9 area hotels warning of a woman they believe could be a terrorist and who now may be in the @entity95 resort town
one flier seen by @entity97 asks workers to be on the lookout for @entity100 , described as the widow of a member of a militant group from the @entity30
the woman , according to the flier , may be involved in organizing " a terrorist act within the 2014 @entity55 region
" @entity97 obtained a copy of the flier , which is dated january 15 , from security staff at a hotel in @entity9
the flier says authorities have received information about @entity100 's possible arrival in the region last week
photos of @entity100 have flooded television and social media reports from @entity9 , and some describe her as a " black widow
" many of them are widows of insurgents killed by government forces , and they 've been blamed for high - profile suicide bombings
security experts stressed monday that @entity100 was probably one of many suspects that authorities are trying to find
" i guarantee , they 're talking about this one black widow , " former @entity130 officer @entity129 said , " but there are others that they 're also worried about
" in a video that surfaced sunday , two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month 's back - to - back bombings in the @entity5 city of @entity138 made an ominous promise
" we 've prepared a present for you and all tourists who 'll come over , " the video says
" if you will hold the @entity8 , you 'll get a present from us for the @entity146 blood that 's been spilled
" the @entity148 military has contingency plans in place for an evacuation of @entity148 citizens in case of a major incident in @entity9 .
