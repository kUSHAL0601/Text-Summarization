-- better late than never
@entity2 manager @entity1 did n't sign a forward or striker in this year 's january transfer window when his team was very much still in the @entity8 title race , instead relying on unproven 21 - year - old @entity9 to back up @entity11 international @entity10
the move backfired , with @entity2 -- as in years past -- slipping away in february and march
@entity1 and @entity2 , though , ventured into the market thursday and landed @entity14 from @entity15
the 25 - year - old agreed to join the @entity17 from @entity15 on a " long - term contract " for an " undisclosed fee , " @entity2 said on its website
that fee is about $ 51 million , according to reports
@entity14 impressed for @entity23 at the @entity24 in @entity25 with his finishing -- scoring twice -- and work rate
he netted 47 goals in 141 games for @entity15 , the @entity31 club said , and he won a league title and the @entity33 in his three years in @entity34
" i 'm so happy to be joining @entity2 , a club which has a great manager , a fantastic squad of players , huge support around the world and a great stadium in @entity42 , " @entity14 told @entity2 's website
" i 'm looking forward to meeting my new teammates and to be playing for @entity2 in the @entity8 and @entity44
" i will give my best to @entity2 and want to make all the supporters happy
" @entity1 called @entity14 a " fantastic " footballer
" @entity14 will add power , creativity and much quality to our squad and we are all looking forward to him joining up with us in a few weeks , " @entity1 told @entity2 's website
" he has consistently produced top - quality performances at the highest level for a number of seasons now and we are all excited to see him integrate into the @entity2 squad
" i 'm sure all @entity2 supporters will join me in welcoming @entity14 to our club
" as excited as the @entity2 fans are bound to be , many will be hoping for more signings
@entity2 has n't won the @entity8 title since going unbeaten in 2003/2004 and only narrowly ended its nine - year trophy drought by beating @entity65 in extra time in may 's @entity68 final
@entity14 's departure from @entity15 could yet be another sign that @entity71 is close to joining @entity15 from @entity72
" @entity15 thanks @entity14 for his professionalism and dedication for the three seasons that he has been in the first team squad , and wishes him all the best for the future , " @entity15 said on its website .
