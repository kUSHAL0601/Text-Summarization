in @entity7 , @entity8 , packed up their trucks to chase the news of @entity12 's choice for vice president , @entity2 @entity1 were left reflecting on six days of unprecedented national attention
after the shooting of six people in a @entity2 gurdwara , a stream of national leaders , from the rev. @entity20 to gov. @entity21 , came to offer condolences and support
but there was one person missing
it was you , mr. president
let me be clear : your administration 's response to the massacre has been strong and swift
attorney general @entity33 addressed mourners with compassion and resolve at the friday memorial
: " in the recent past , too many sikhs have been targeted and victimized simply because of who they are , how they look , and what they believe , " he said
. " this is wrong
and it will not be tolerated
" @entity44 from the @entity45 expressed his full commitment to helping us with sustained interfaith and education outreach
the @entity50 and @entity51 were at the top of their game , investigating the attacks as both an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime
but we need more than government cooperation
our community needs the deeper spiritual and emotional assurance that we are welcome to live , work and worship as fellow @entity1
the gunman , @entity63 , was a member of a white supremacist group that wishes to destroy our very claim to call this country home
after the attack we endured , @entity1 , and all brown and black people in @entity71 for that matter , need our president to directly show the nation that we belong here
watch : volunteers help temple mourners cope president @entity78 , you flew to @entity79 , @entity80 , to mourn publicly with the families before the dead were buried
you hugged your daughters closer that night , imagining them in that theater
in response to the massacre of @entity2 in @entity7 , you and @entity12 issued statements of support , but did not suspend campaigning in @entity8 , as you did in @entity80
of the major networks , only @entity0 sent an anchor to report live from @entity7 , and none of the networks covered the murders as extensively as they did in @entity80
we worry that because the victims were brown - skinned people with " foreign " names , the tragedy has n't elicited the same attention from public officials and the media
i believe you can help the nation feel our pain
you can show this tragedy is an @entity71 tragedy , because none of us should have to fear gunfire in their own churches , synagogues and mosques
if @entity112 could have been your son , and the kids in the @entity79 theater your daughters , then the aunts and uncles shot while praying on that sunday could have also been your own
we wish you were there on thursday morning when community members entered their gurdwara for the first time since the massacre
you would have witnessed the spirit of chardi kala in the @entity2 faith -- even in darkness , a rising resilience -- and shared this spirit , which is also part of the @entity71 character
@entity2 women and men walked into a crime scene : blood on the carpets , there were bullet holes in the walls , and shattered windows
they flew into action , ripping out carpets , painting over bullet holes , scrubbing floors , and within hours , they served the first langar ( open meal ) , breaking bread beneath portraits of those who have died for our faith
opinion : why @entity71 sikhs will survive we wish you were there later that night for the town hall meeting organized by your @entity51
nearly every @entity2 @entity71 told officials that the attack on sunday was not isolated or " senseless , " but one in a long pattern of intentional acts of hate and discrimination in the last decade and long before
our children are bullied in schools , our men and women are profiled at airports and barred from military service unless they give up their turbans , and our people endure racial slurs and hate crimes that are not specifically tracked by the @entity50
you would have heard the community 's cry for help and publicly called upon all @entity1 to recommit to curbing the alarming rise of hate and fear in this country
news : @entity33 calls @entity2 temple shooting a hate crime we wish you were there on friday morning for the memorial for the dead
three thousand people filled the @entity188 gymnasium , a sea of people sitting in reverence and sorrow before six open caskets
we are deeply moved that you ordered the flags lowered to half - mast , an expression of respect and honor
but for @entity2 , and for muslims who watched eight mosques attacked in eleven days , the threat is not over
" all politics aside , a personal visit , even with the victims ' families , the temple , the people , for [ the president ] to take pictures with people who have turbans and beards does so much for our safety , " said @entity203 , whose father was killed bravely fighting the gunman
i returned to @entity219 this week
one cab driver pointed to his brown skin and said to me : " this is not just about @entity2 people
this is an attack on me too
" belief : @entity2 ireports speak to long - held fears in their community president @entity78 , i believe you can help our nation find lasting lessons in @entity7
now that we 've had time to grieve , people who care are turning to one another and asking : what do we do now ? " it is that fundamental belief that i am my brother 's keeper , [ and ] i am my sister 's keeper , that makes this country work , " attorney general @entity33 said , repeating your words at the memorial service
president @entity78 , i believe that your wisdom , compassion , and voice can help @entity2 and all @entity1 chart the way forward
you may find the starting point when you visit the @entity2 gurdwara in @entity7 -- a single bullet hole remains and below it a sign : " @entity254
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .
