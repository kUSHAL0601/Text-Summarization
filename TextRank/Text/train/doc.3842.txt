is very glad to be alive -- and finally able to talk about the show 's season three finale
" you ca n't imagine the pressure that 's finally off , " he said
" i 'm finally able to have all the cards on the table
" before sunday night , @entity3 had only told three ( ok , maybe four ) people about how @entity13 would become a walker , keeping the list limited to his girlfriend , his kids , and maybe a trusted friend who lived near where they shot the show in @entity22
" i may have taken an authorized photo of myself as a walker , and i may have sent that to him under threat of dismemberment if he passed that along , " @entity3 said
" but the last thing you want to do is spoil season three of ' @entity2 ' where you turn into a zombie and kill @entity32 ! " @entity33 shares final thoughts on her ' @entity2 ' experience turning into a zombie meant @entity3 finally got his turn in the chair in the " more bloody and gross " makeup trailer reserved for walkers
all season long , @entity13 has been kept squeaky clean , raising serious questions such as , " where is he sending his dry cleaning ? " @entity3 laughed
" how is he showering three times a day ? where is he getting all his razors ? " " from the beginning , they were like , ' no sexy dirt on him
he 's always tucked in , ' " @entity3 continued
" i was like , ' wow , there 's something about this that 's going to go somewhere
' and nope ! he 's just the clean guy
no sexy dirt for me
@entity1 never got the sexy anything , did he ? " but for the few scenes in the finale , @entity3 was sexy , dirty , bloody , the whole shebang , as @entity13 was left in a locked room to turn and " tear the flesh from ( @entity32 's ) bones , " whether he liked it or not
that scene meant he got to go through a lot of emotional turmoil , " knowing she 's going to be taken out , knowing it 's over , and everything he worked for is going to die , and someone he cared for is going to die
" what 's inside a walker ? cast , producer spill their guts @entity1 did n't imagine that he would be " used as a tool to take @entity32 out " as well , and if he had , " he would have behaved differently , " @entity3 said
" i think he thought there would be a bullet in his head , and that 's it
" in the original plan for the scene , there actually was a bullet involved , but during the reshoot , it was changed to a stabbing
either way , @entity1 had to collapse , he said , " in a pool of fake viscous blood that sort of cooled and crackled for hours and hours and hours
" to make shooting that part of the finale a little easier , his co-star @entity96 kept him in stitches beforehand with some " gallows humor
" " before the door opened and he throws me to my knees , he and i were crying , laughing , at the jokes we were making , " @entity3 said
" i can promise you that they were completely inappropriate , and that they were hilarious
after a while , it was n't even that it was funny as much as that we needed to straighten up before that door opened
it was like laughing in church , or laughing in school
" but no matter how much fun he had on set , do n't expect @entity13 to be back in the form of flashbacks or visions a @entity122 for @entity123
" i do n't think anyone wants the governor to see @entity13 in a white dress on a balcony ! " @entity3 laughed
( @entity128 just landed a regular gig on " unforgettable " and remains a recurring guest star on " @entity131
" ) besides , assuming he was on the outs , @entity3 swiped a beaker that @entity13 used to use
" i was n't going to take the clothes , for sure , " he said
" i mean , they were great clothes for @entity13 , but not for @entity136
