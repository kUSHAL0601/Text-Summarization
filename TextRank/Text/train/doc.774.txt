@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 woman is planning to dive into the ocean off @entity0 on friday in her bid to become the first person to swim across the @entity9 without a shark cage or swim aids such as flippers or a wetsuit
if successful , @entity14 , 49 , would surpass her own record that she set in 2011 for the longest unassisted swim
@entity14 swam more than 67 miles from @entity18 island to @entity20 island
her swim to the @entity22 will cover a much great section of water , much of it shark - infested
" she will swim continuously 103 miles or 166 kilometers under standard open - water swimming rules ; that means no wetsuit , no shark cage , " her husband , @entity32 , said thursday when the couple spoke to reporters
" there have been other attempts , but no one has completed the swim under these rules
we expect the team to take 40 to 50 hours , " he said
in 1997 , fellow @entity4 swimmer @entity40 completed a similar swim but from inside a shark cage
golden girl of @entity4 swimming in 2011 , long - distance swimmer @entity45 twice tried and failed to complete the same journey
@entity45 was waylaid by asthma attacks and stings from @entity50 man - of - war jellyfish
a lycra suit will provide her some protection from jellyfish , @entity14 said , and long cables called " shark shields " will be strung from the kayaks and boats around her to ward off larger predators
" they emit an electric field through the water , which when a shark comes within 5 meters , it picks up the sensors on the snout , but they do n't like it
they swim away , " @entity14 said
@entity14 , who is a mother of three and grandmother of two , said she hopes that swimming in the wake of @entity69 will provide her with calm seas
olympian attempting comeback a crew of 15 , including medical personnel and meteorologists , will shadow her from boats and kayaks
she will try to stay nourished and hydrated by consuming a carbohydrate - rich drink every 30 minutes , she said
even though she has completed long - distance swims of the @entity80 and a round - trip crossing of the @entity82 , the waters between @entity1 and the @entity84 present their own hazards , she said
" each swim comes with its own challenges
this is a really big challenge ; 103 miles is further than i have ever swum before , " @entity14 said
" i expect it to be very challenging , but i am very excited
