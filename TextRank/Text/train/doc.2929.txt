almost 70 years after the liberation of @entity2 , the concentration camp set up by the @entity4 to exterminate @entity6 prisoners , there are still a handful of @entity8 who continue to receive @entity12 @entity11 benefits
the @entity13 unanimously passed a bill -- dubbed the " no @entity11 for @entity15 " -- on tuesday that would cut off those benefits
@entity18 @entity17 rep. @entity17 , a decorated @entity19 veteran who was a prisoner of war for seven years during the @entity21 , was the lead sponsor of the legislation
" while the number of nazis receiving @entity11 is few , allowing payments to continue is an insult to those who suffered at the hands of the @entity8 , " @entity17 said
@entity30 has considered various proposals designed to deny any benefits from @entity8
this latest bill was introduced last month after a recent @entity35 investigation reported that dozens of @entity8 who were deported from the @entity12 were still collecting millions of dollars in retirement benefits
even though these people were stripped of their @entity12 citizenship and forced to leave the country a loophole in the law allowed them to continue receiving @entity11 checks
@entity46 rep. @entity45 of @entity47 , who has been a key proponent in changing the law , told @entity49 that she has asked both the @entity50 and @entity51 to find out how much money was paid out and how many were still receiving any social security funds
she estimated there were roughly four individuals who were still eligible for the payments
" they are dying out , but anybody who gets it is too much
they came to this country under false pretenses , " @entity59 told @entity49
suspected @entity64 war criminal dies hours before court approves extradition there is a companion bill in the @entity69 and the sponsors of the @entity13 bill are confident that this is one item that both parties in the @entity13 and @entity69 can get to the president 's desk before the lame duck session of wraps up this month
" if we ca n't agree on this , my goodness what can we agree on ? " @entity59 asked .
