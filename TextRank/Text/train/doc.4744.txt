thanks to hard - drinking , hardworking @entity2 , we 've traveled through the ' 60s in style
now let 's take a look at the ad man 's @entity6
" @entity14 , " the @entity9 series that @entity10 called " the greatest tv drama of all time , " is back for a new season on sunday
and though it 's filmed primarily in @entity16 , the show is set in @entity6 , and notable locations across the city turn up in the script as liberally as a heap of pastrami on rye
in preparation for the season six premiere , we offer you this guide to the @entity6 haunts of ad exec @entity2 and his endlessly entertaining cohorts at @entity30
' @entity14 ' and the other 1960s eat on an episode titled " @entity36 in the face , " bosses - on - the - loose @entity2 and @entity33 spend their lunch -- and expense accounts -- taking full advantage of the eats and drinks at the venerable @entity43 , some of which later embarrassingly ended up on the carpet at the feet of a group of potential clients
hopefully you 'll have more restraint when you visit this 100 - year - old seafood establishment on the lower level of @entity53 , where tourists mingle with commuters over martinis and platters of freshly shucked oysters and other fishy delights
@entity60 42nd st. , www.oysterbarny.com another celebration featuring our @entity14 stars , this time @entity2 and the lusty wife of an insult comic , took place at legendary restaurant @entity66

a stay at this landmark hotel will have you feeling like a part of the show , especially since its decor gives it the appearance of an elaborate " @entity14 " set piece , but the place to really connect with the show is just past the lobby in the @entity103
on april 7 , to coincide with the season premiere , the lounge will host a viewing party with complimentary whiskey tastings and a " best ' @entity109 " contest
the festivities will continue with themed cocktails and an invitation for patrons to dress in their ' 60s best each sunday the show airs

" @entity135 , www.pjclarkes.com mad men , mad ' dos : what the late ' 60s really looked like stay when @entity2 and friends started their own agency at the end of season three , they set up shop , at least temporarily , in a suite at the @entity145
the fabled lodging , which overlooks @entity147 , was renovated and modernized a few years back , so your room might not ooze nostalgia
but if you close your eyes tight enough , you might just be able to imagine @entity152 typing away in the corner or @entity154 squawking on the phone with a client
2 @entity60 61st st. , www.tajhotels.com/pierre given that the @entity158 in @entity159 is the scene of a lunchtime tryst between copywriter @entity115 and a fellow named @entity163 from a rival agency , it 's only appropriate that the prestigious property is offering a special " @entity14 " package for fans of the show
