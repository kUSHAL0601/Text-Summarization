" @entity22 " is at times violent and dark , like @entity79 , vividly character driven like @entity80 and panoramic in its scope , like @entity83 , appropriate considering @entity23 was a @entity83 fellow at the @entity84

read more about " a @entity95 " on the author 's website and read an excerpt from the book ' @entity146 ' by @entity147 the summer 's most buzzed - about book may be @entity147 ' " @entity146 , " a high - concept thriller borrowing elements from several genres , including mystery , sci - fi and horror
lucky readers who got their hands on the novel early describe it as " @entity158 " meets " @entity162 , " but there 's more depth to this imaginative story
here 's the setup : in depression - era @entity165 , a serial killer finds a mysterious house that opens doors to other times
the killer uses this house of horrors to hunt his victims , all promising young women , across different decades until one victim survives
she then turns the tables , and the victim hunts the hunter
it 's a creepy concept , and @entity147 makes the far - fetched seem plausible thanks to her exceptional writing
critics , booksellers and some well - known novelists are singing the novel 's praises
it 's also captured @entity189 's attention
@entity190 and the producers behind @entity192 hit " @entity197 " just optioned the book , with plans to bring it to tv
it 's easy to understand why , because once you start reading , you will be hard - pressed to put down " @entity146
" read an excerpt from " @entity146 " ' @entity201 ' by @entity202 @entity202 , quite possibly the world 's best - selling writer , reteams with pulp fiction publisher @entity204 for his new paperback thriller , " @entity201
" but do n't be thrown by the tawdry cover featuring a buxom redhead ; this is classic king
it 's a murder mystery with a ghostly twist
in 1973 small - town @entity213 , @entity212 is a heartbroken college student who takes a summer job working at the local amusement park
@entity202 has loaded the story with lots of " carny " language , much of it authentic , some of it invented
for instance , did you know a shooting gallery is called a " bang shy " in carnival speak ? when he 's not running the @entity230 spin ride or pushing a popcorn wagon , @entity212 is intrigued by a local legend
turns out @entity201 's haunted house is truly haunted by the ghost of a young woman , murdered on the ride years before
with the help of a few fellow carny friends , @entity212 sets out to find the killer
along the way , he meets a little boy suffering from a terminal illness , who may be able to help him with the more otherworldly aspects of this mystery
while the story is at times dark and intense , there 's less of @entity202 's trademark horror and more of the wistful nostalgia and emotion that will remind fans of " @entity252 " and " @entity253 , " especially for its bittersweet and moving conclusion
read an excerpt from " @entity201 " ' @entity256 ' by @entity257 we turn from mystery to myth in @entity257 's " @entity256
" the book hits stores june 18 , and the author 's scores of fans are champing at the bit
the prolific @entity267 writer has penned award - winning children 's stories , such as " @entity270 , " films including the animated " @entity272 , " the hugely popular " @entity274 " graphic novels and even a recent episode of " @entity278 , " but @entity257 has n't written a true novel for adults since 2005
the book can be read easily in an afternoon , and it 's well worth the wait
an unnamed narrator visits his childhood home in @entity283 , @entity284 , to attend a funeral when he 's drawn into a forgotten memory of his youth
hazy details start to take shape , a farmhouse at the end of the lane , a duck pond , an odd little girl who was once a friend , her mother and grandmother , all three who may be more than they reveal
while exploring the countryside , the two young friends encounter something dark and menacing that follows them home , and a life and death battle begins
the story could be called something of a distant cousin to @entity307 , but @entity257 's novel is more about myth than magic
his narrator says at one point , " i liked myths
they were n't adult stories and they were n't children 's stories
they were better than that
" while that succinctly sums up the book , even more so , this is a rich story beautifully told about memory , innocence and a longing for the way things were when we were younger
