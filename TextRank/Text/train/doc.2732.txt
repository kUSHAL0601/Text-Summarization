@entity0 -- in first - ever tests for commercial airplanes carrying passengers , as many as three @entity3 jets will be equipped with a shoulder - fired missile defense system
the @entity8 signed a $ 29 million contract with @entity10 on december 21
@entity10 said thursday it is working with @entity3 to put laser systems on the planes , which will be flying between @entity13 and @entity14
since the contract calls for the planes to log about 7,000 flight hours , the tests will probably last from early spring , starting in march or april , until the end of the year , @entity8 spokeswoman @entity15 said
the systems have already been tested on cargo aircraft and out - of - service passenger planes
the new contract calls for the systems to be tested for the first time on aircraft carrying passengers
@entity8 , @entity3 and @entity10 were all careful to assure there will be no test firing -- through simulators or otherwise
the tests primarily will check the systems ' worthiness in air and their maintenance reliability
the system works by detecting the heat - seeking missiles and then emitting a laser that diverts the missile
@entity8 officials say there is no specific threat of these weapons -- also known as @entity45 , for @entity45 -- being fired at planes
@entity48 forces , however , successfully used @entity45 against @entity50 helicopters in @entity51
terrorists tried , unsuccessfully , in 2002 to shoot down an @entity54 passenger jet in @entity55 with them
insurgents hit a @entity59 cargo plane in @entity60 the following year , but the plane landed safely
experts say about 500,000 to 700,000 manpads have been produced worldwide , and some have been purchased in @entity65 and @entity67 arms markets for as little as $ 5,000
since 2003 , @entity68 has pressured @entity8 to adapt military @entity70 technology to commercial aviation
commercial airlines have opposed efforts to install defense systems , which are costly , add weight , and can weaken the plane 's aerodynamics
a chief goal of the testing program is to discover how to increase the systems ' endurance
military systems require frequent maintenance -- not practical for commercial airplanes that fly for extended periods between maintenance checks
@entity3 on thursday said it is participating in the program , but added it is " not in favor of installing counter-manpads on commercial aircraft
" the airline believes protection is best accomplished by preventing terrorists from getting shoulder - fired missiles , or by using ground - based systems , spokesman @entity91 said
but the airline said it is willing to participate because it " wants to understand the development " of these technologies that might be available in the future
last year , @entity102 and @entity10 installed and test flew @entity10 's hardware on a @entity105 767 that was not in commercial service , @entity91 said
