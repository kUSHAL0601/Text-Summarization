-- after 22 years on death row , @entity1 is close to freedom
a jury convicted the @entity6 woman , now 49 , of murder , conspiracy to commit murder , child abuse and kidnapping on october 12 , 1990 , less than a year after her 4 - year - old son was found dead
a judge sentenced her to death a few months later
but those convictions and the related sentence were tossed out thursday by a federal appeals court judge
in explaining his decision , chief judge @entity18 of the federal 9th @entity19 chided the prosecution for remaining " unconstitutionally silent " on the " history of misconduct " of its key witness , a @entity25 police detective
" the @entity26 requires a fair trial , " @entity18 wrote
" this never happened in @entity1 's case
" a day after seeing @entity31 at a mall , young @entity30 asked his mother if he could go again
that was the plan , she said , when the boy got into the car with @entity1 's roommate , @entity37
@entity37 picked up a friend , " but instead of heading to the mall , the two men drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine , where @entity37 shot @entity46 three times in the head , " according to @entity18 's summary of the case
@entity37 was convicted of first - degree murder in the boy 's killing and sentenced to death
the detective , @entity53 , said the friend told him that @entity1 was involved in a plot to kill her son
but neither the friend nor @entity37 testified to that assertion in court
in fact , " no other witnesses or direct evidence ( linked ) @entity62 to the crime " other than @entity53 's testimony
after pleading not guilty , @entity1 stood trial and tried to convince a jury that her account -- and not the detective 's -- was the true one
" the trial was , essentially , a swearing contest between @entity1 and ... @entity53 , " said @entity18
the detective testified he " did n't buy " @entity1 's reaction after he informed her that her son was dead
after that , @entity53 said he placed @entity1 under arrest
in a subsequent interrogation , she confessed that her role in the murder conspiracy was a " bad judgment call , " the detective said
but @entity1 offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role in a murder plot
there was no recording of the interrogation , no one else was in the room or watching from a two - way mirror , and @entity53 said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report
" the judge and jury believed @entity53 , " said @entity18 of the verdict and sentence
" but they did n't know about @entity53 's long history of lying under oath and other misconduct
" specifically , the judge noted that the detective had been suspended five days for taking " liberties " with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors ; that judges had tossed out four confessions or indictments because @entity53 had lied under oath ; and that judges suppressed or vacated four confessions because @entity53 had violated a person 's constitutional rights
" the state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents , " @entity18 said
" ... there can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation
" the judge ordered " the state " to turn over @entity53 's personnel records to @entity1 's lawyers , after which " a police official " must state under oath that everything has been disclosed and nothing has been " omitted , lost or destroyed
" once this is done , a district court must order @entity1 's release unless prosecutors tell the court within 30 days that they plan to retry her soon
" in the balance hangs the life of @entity1 , " @entity18 said , explaining the importance of his decision to overturn her convictions .
