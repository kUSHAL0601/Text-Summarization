@entity0 the last hand in the " two thumbs up " film critic team , @entity4 , died thursday , two days after revealing cancer returned to his body
@entity4 and @entity9 co-hosted the iconic review show " @entity9 and @entity14 " until @entity9 's death in 1999 after a battle with a brain tumor
the @entity15 , the base of operations for @entity4 's syndicated reviews , announced his death at age 70
" we were getting ready to go home today for hospice care , when he looked at us , smiled , and passed away
no struggle , no pain , just a quiet , dignified transition , " his wife , @entity25 , said in a statement thursday
" i 'll see you at the movies , " were the last words @entity4 wrote to his readers
they were published in an essay titled " @entity36 " on his blog tuesday , in which he explained he was planning to slow down and reduce the number of movie reviews he wrote
" my intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me , " @entity4 wrote
" what 's more , i 'll be able at last to do what i 've always fantasized about doing : reviewing only the movies i want to review
" @entity4 had already lost his voice and much of his jaw after battling thyroid and salivary gland cancer
he suffered a hip fracture in december , and it recently led to the revelations about cancer , he said
@entity4 started as the @entity15 film critic on april 3 , 1967 , writing about 200 reviews each of those 46 years , he said
the last year however , was his most prolific
" last year , i wrote the most of my career , including 306 movie reviews , a blog post or two a week , and assorted other articles , " he said
" i must slow down now , which is why i 'm taking what i like to call ' a leave of presence
' " @entity4 : the critical critic with an open mind @entity4 , who won a @entity69 for film criticism in 1975 , had a way with words and a sharp wit that is not easily matched
-- about @entity75 's " @entity74 : @entity76 " in 2005 : " if he 's going to persist in making bad movies , he 's going to -- have to grow accustomed to reading bad reviews
" -- concerning @entity75 's reaction to another critic who panned the film : " but @entity75 is correct , and @entity82 has not yet won a @entity69
therefore , @entity82 is not qualified to complain that @entity83 financed " @entity74 : @entity76 " while passing on the opportunity to participate in " @entity84 , " " @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " sideways " and " finding neverland
" as chance would have it , i have won the @entity69 , and so i am qualified
speaking in my official capacity as a @entity69 winner , mr. @entity75 , your movie sucks
" two years later , flowers showed up at @entity4 's door with a card , signed " @entity99 , @entity75
" " the bouquet did n't change my opinion of his movie , but i do n't think he intended that , " @entity4 wrote
" it was a way of stepping back
it was a reminder that in the great scheme of things , a review does n't mean very much
sometimes when i write a negative review , people will say , ' i 'll bet you ca n't wait to hammer his next film
i would far rather praise the next film to show that i maintained an open mind
" -- a good example of @entity4 's willingness to keep an open mind comes from his review of @entity120 's 2001 comedy " @entity123 " of which he wrote one of his most scathing reviews : " this movie does n't scrape the bottom of the barrel
this movie is n't the bottom of the barrel
this movie is n't below the bottom of the barrel
this movie does n't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels
" but after watching @entity120 in " @entity134 " a year later , @entity4 revisited the film that he had awarded a rare zero stars : " but the thing is , i remember ' @entity123 ' more than a year later
i refer to it sometimes
and for all its sins , it was at least an ambitious movie , a go - for - broke attempt to accomplish something
it failed , but it has not left me convinced that @entity120 does n't have good work in him
anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing
" -- reviewing " @entity154 " : " i 've seen audits that were more thrilling
" -- giving no love to " @entity156 : @entity156 " : " to say that @entity157 can not write a love scene is an understatement ; greeting cards have expressed more passion
" @entity4 : the film philosopher -- " every great film should seem new every time you see it
" -- " no good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough
" -- " if you have to ask what it symbolizes , it did n't
" -- " if a movie is n't a hit right out of the gate , they drop it
which means that the whole mainstream @entity179 product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy
" -- " i am utterly bored by celebrity interviews
most celebrities are devoid of interest
" @entity4 : remembered -- wife @entity25 : " i am devastated by the loss of my love , @entity4 -- my husband , my friend , my confidante and oh - so - brilliant partner of over 20 years
he fought a courageous fight
i 've lost the love of my life and the world has lost a visionary and a creative and generous spirit who touched so many people all over the world
we had a lovely , lovely life together , more beautiful and epic than a movie
it had its highs and the lows , but was always experienced with good humor , grace and a deep abiding love for each other
" @entity4 was a beloved husband , stepfather to @entity214 and @entity215 , and grandfather to @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220
just yesterday he was saying how his grandchildren were ' the best things in my life
' he was happy and radiating satisfaction over the outpouring of responses to his blog about his 46th year as a film critic
but he was also getting tired of his fight with cancer , and said if this takes him , he has lived a great and full life
" -- @entity238 president and ceo @entity237 : " @entity4 championed the art of the moving image and by the courage of his personal example demonstrated how much movies matter
@entity4 chaired the @entity238 jury of critics , filmmakers and scholars who selected the year 's 10 best films in 2004
he held the gavel that day with the same enthusiasm for excellence that made his voice a force in @entity251 popular culture
" -- @entity259 mayor @entity260 : " our whole city learned with sadness today of the passing of @entity4 , whose name was synonymous with two things : the movies and @entity259
in a @entity69 winning career that spanned more than four decades , thousands of reviews and countless acts of generosity to others , @entity4 championed @entity259 as a center for filmmaking and critiques
with a knowledge of his subject as deep as his love for his wife @entity273 , @entity4 will be remembered for the strength of his work , respected for his courage in the face of illness , and revered for his contribution to filmmaking and to our city
the final reel of his life may have run through to the end , but his memory will never fade
" -- @entity291 in chief @entity292 : " the long relationship between @entity4 and his @entity15 family speaks volumes about @entity4 's commitment to his craft and to his fans around the world
@entity4 's reviews were highly anticipated by readers and the film community
film commentary was only one of several gifts
he was a reporter first , in every aspect of his craft
he could write as eloquently about world affairs as he could on the upcoming blockbuster
@entity4 will be missed not only by the @entity15 family , but by the journalism and film communities
our thoughts are with @entity4 's wife , @entity273 , and their family during this time
