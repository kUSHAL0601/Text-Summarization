@entity0 -- my 91 - year - old mother finds a lot of things aggravating
drugstores that run out of things that are on sale
and phone calls from @entity11
quite a few phone calls from @entity11
and other people advocating for each of them
also the television ads. do they have to run so many ? this is one time my mother and the rest of @entity22 appear to be in sync
the political atmosphere that has prevailed since february 2011 , when @entity25 gov. @entity25 launched his proposals to strip public employee unions of almost all of their power , remains supercharged
but as one big event follows another , with more coming soon , there is also a widespread sense that it 's all getting to be too much
how much can one state take ? a sense of political fatigue appears to be growing just as events are coming to a peak
actually , they 're coming to quite a few peaks , which is part of the problem
there 's the peak that comes tuesday , with the @entity47 presidential primary
@entity11 and @entity13 , the two front - runners , have been up and down , particularly in the eastern half of @entity22 the last few days
it 's been rare in the last few decades for a @entity22 primary to be consequential , but the general assumption is that if @entity11 beats @entity13 , @entity11 will pretty much seal the deal as the @entity47 nominee
so this is kind of a big deal
then there 's the peak that will come over the next few weeks : a recall election in which @entity25 , who took office only 15 months ago , will face a @entity62 challenger , quite possibly the person he defeated in november 2010 , @entity0 mayor @entity63
the recall , only the third for a governor in @entity69 history , was ordered after more than 900,000 people signed petitions
a @entity62 primary with -- as it appears at the moment -- four candidates will be held on may 8 , with a final election june 5
at the same time in recall - happy @entity22 , @entity25 's lieutenant governor , @entity76 , will also face a recall , making her the first lieutenant governor in @entity69 history in that situation , and four state @entity81 seats held by @entity47 will be involved in recall elections , with control of that house of the @entity86 in the balance
then there are the fall elections , with the strong prospect that @entity22 will be a key battleground between president @entity92 and the @entity47 nominee
then there 's an open seat for the @entity81
@entity62 sen. @entity96 is retiring , and a heated @entity47 primary for that nomination is shaping up for august
so that totals up to major election days in april , may , june , august and november
it also means the prospect -- already being demonstrated -- of amazing amounts of campaign spending , much of it by independent groups ; of robocalls inundating people across the state , and a level of television advertising that some experts say may leave @entity22 viewers in the unenviable position of being exposed to more political spots in one year than virtually anyone else in @entity69 history
it adds up to more than $ 100 million worth of political advertising in one state over 11 months
if one were to rank these election dates in order of interest , the @entity25 recall would be at the top of the stack
tuesday 's presidential primary may be a big deal in the national perspective , but it has been a relatively low - passion event at ground level
according to polls , @entity11 trailed @entity13 in february ; he was ahead in the last few days
@entity22 has a large number of conservative voters , but the religiously motivated are n't as numerous as they are in @entity136 states , where @entity13 has done well
plus , it appears many @entity22 republicans , starting with powerful rep. @entity139 , want to get the nomination race over and unite behind @entity11
as in other places , support of @entity11 does n't appear to mean high enthusiasm
the @entity25 recall , on the other hand , carries huge implications for @entity22 's political climate for at least the next few years
@entity25 remains a polarizing figure like few who have ever crossed the landscape of the state
in almost any conversation with people who are not directly working in campaigns , the exhaustion factor comes up quickly
when will it all end ? how many more ads can we take ? how bottomless are the checkbooks of donors , especially the small - to midlevel donors ? these concerns are sort of like the old @entity163 line about the restaurant that nobody goes to anymore because it 's too crowded
@entity167 are worn down precisely because so much is going on , so many people are in various forms of uproar , and the parade of amazing political events does n't seem to stop
but in a state that historically has had very high voter turnout , one of the things that will be important to watch in coming months is how many people come to the polls
will turnout begin to droop ? if so , to whose advantage or disadvantage ? at what point does fatigue become a major player on the battlefield of @entity22 politics , and a 91 - year - old woman who would prefer some political peace and quiet become a key opinion leader ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .
