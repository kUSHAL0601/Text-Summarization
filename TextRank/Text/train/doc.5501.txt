@entity0 -- a prominent @entity5 scholar labeled a separatist by @entity8 authorities may have been tried in secret and received a heavy prison sentence , his lawyer told @entity1 on june 18
@entity11 , an economics professor at @entity0 's @entity12 , was detained by police in january and taken to @entity14 , capital of the restive far - western @entity16 region , where a spate of recent violent incidents were blamed by the government on @entity5 separatists seeking to establish an independent state
state media has reported that @entity11 was charged with separatism
@entity24 , his lawyer , cited anonymous sources for the news of his client 's secret trial and sentencing
" i 'm shocked but do n't think these are groundless rumors , " said @entity24 , who has not been allowed to see @entity11 for months
" considering the tense situation in @entity16 , i think this is very possible
" @entity24 said local police would neither confirm nor deny the news to him
@entity1 's repeated phone calls wednesday to the @entity16 government and police went unanswered
the foreign ministry declined to comment on the case tuesday
vocal critic @entity11 is known for his research on @entity43 relations and has been a vocal critic of the government 's ethnic policies in @entity16 , a resource - rich region long inhabited by the turkic - speaking , largely @entity49
the arrival of waves of @entity52 , @entity8 's predominant ethnic group , over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions
human rights groups call @entity11 's possible secret trial " disturbing
" " secret trials of prominent activists are very rare these days in @entity8 -- one would expect at least a show trial with the presence of his lawyer , " said @entity57 , a @entity58 - based researcher for @entity59
" @entity11 has long considered himself speaking out for @entity5 ' human rights in ways that are reasonable and acceptable to the authorities , " she added
" if harsh measures are being used against him , it really shows the authorities ' line of tolerance has shifted a lot in the past year
" widespread discrimination some @entity5 have expressed resentment toward the @entity52 majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from @entity8 security forces and loss of economic opportunities to @entity52 people in @entity16
@entity84 has said that @entity5 face widespread discrimination in employment , housing and educational opportunities , as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization
other critics , including exiled uyghur activists , have attributed the rise of violence in @entity16 to @entity0 's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government strongly denies
in the region 's deadliest violent incident in recent history , a suicide bombing last month killed 39 people at a street market in @entity14
another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in april at an @entity14 train station
in march , 29 people were stabbed to death by alleged uyghur separatists at a train station in the southwestern city of @entity111
the @entity8 government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into @entity16
executions on monday , @entity8 executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in @entity16 in recent months , state media reported
the same day , a court in @entity14 sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in @entity0 's @entity126 last october
defendant names revealed by state media all sounded @entity5
" repression plus economic incentives -- that has continued to be the government response , " said @entity128 , of @entity59
" economic development and job opportunities are important to the @entity49 , but these things must be done in a way that respects their culture and freedom of expression
" unfortunately , the government is more interested in projecting what it wishes to do in @entity16 rather than looking at what the real problems and ethnic grievances are in the region
