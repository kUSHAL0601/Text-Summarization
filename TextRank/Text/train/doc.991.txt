@entity0 -- it 's not just the athletes going for gold in the @entity5 -- it appears that some of the torch bearers may be trying to cash in on the role of carrying the flame
in the few days since the @entity11 flame arrived in @entity13 several adverts for what are claimed to be genuine @entity11 torches have appeared on the online auction site @entity17 , some with eye - watering price tags
six torches have sold for more than £ 100,000 ( $ 158,000 ) on @entity17 , although it 's not known whether money actually changed hands at the end of the auction
one bidder asks if a torch is authentic , and the seller , who lives in @entity30 , @entity31 , responds : " running at 1638 on monday
it will be dispatched within my handling time
absolutely authentic , i would n't risk my @entity17 rating on selling a fake
" after a frenzy of up to 163 bids , the " soot - marked torch " sold for £ 153,000 ( $ 241,000 )
@entity5 organizers say they can not be used again as the burner system is disabled after each runner finishes a section
some sellers say they will donate a percentage of the sale price to charity , with one offering to give 10 % to @entity48
each of the torches used in the 70 - day relay up to the opening ceremony on 27 july has been offered in advance to the runner at a discounted price of just under £ 199 ( $ 314 ) ... or £ 215 ( $ 339 ) if they bought it on the day
organizers say the money helps to cover the production costs of £ 594 ( $ 937 ) for each of the perforated , aluminum alloy torches
a spokeswoman for the 2012 games said : " the torches are the torch bearers ' to do what they want with them -- we hope they find a good home
" @entity5 organizers are not responsible for the distinctive torches once the runners take ownership , but the spokeswoman urged potential online bidders to be cautious
she advised anyone considering making a bid to check the seller 's identity and then visit the official @entity5 website which carries a full list of torch bearers
large crowds have been turning out each day to watch the procession of the @entity11 flame through the @entity13 and some have gained a glimpse of a celebrity -- @entity31 soccer star and @entity93 player , @entity92 , lit the first torch on its arrival in the @entity13
and @entity97 rapper and @entity98 took a turn carrying the flame on monday
organizers say there will be a series of high - profile bearers throughout the relay but are staying tight - lipped about exactly who they are
apart from celebrities and athletes , most of the runners were chosen in recognition for a contribution to their community or personal achievement and followed a nomination process
the journey began when the flame was lit from the sun 's rays at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122
the flame will feature at the opening ceremony when the final torch bearer lights the cauldron inside @entity0 's @entity126
in the interim , it will be carried 8,000 miles across the @entity13 by 8,000 runners and using a route that organizers say will be within 10 miles of 95 % of the population
five days into the relay , crowds are still turning out in force across the south west of @entity31
" i think it 's fantastic there 's been so much enthusiasm running through each community , " said the @entity5 spokeswoman
" i think it 's a very @entity13 thing to do -- to get behind something in your community
