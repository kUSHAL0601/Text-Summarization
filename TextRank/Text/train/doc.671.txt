-- after playing just one match , @entity1 announced wednesday that she is withdrawing from the @entity3
the 31 - year - old has had nearly every injury in the book , but she offered an unusual reason this time around : @entity9 's syndrome , a poorly understood autoimmune disorder that causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels
@entity1 had played only 11 matches this season because of injuries and illness
" i am thankful i finally have a diagnosis and am now focused on getting better and returning to the court soon , " @entity1 said in a statement
as many as 4 million @entity20 have @entity9 's syndrome ( pronounced show - grens ) , according to the @entity23 , making it the second most common autoimmune disease after rheumatoid arthritis , and ahead of lupus
ninety percent of the people with the syndrome are women
@entity0 : signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis it 's " a major women 's health problem , " says @entity35 , @entity36 , associate professor of clinical medicine at the @entity38 and chief of rheumatology at @entity41 , in @entity42
" a lot of patients look a lot better than they feel
" how well are you managing your @entity47 ? take a test in @entity9 's , the white blood cells attack moisture - producing glands
the most common symptoms are persistent dry eyes and dry mouth , but the syndrome can lead to complications including extreme fatigue , joint pain , and problems with the kidneys , lungs , liver , pancreas , and central nervous system
@entity0 : 12 nice things you can do for someone in pain because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions , @entity68 's is difficult for even the most experienced doctors to diagnose
it often takes years for a patient to receive a diagnosis after first experiencing symptoms
elite athletes like @entity1 are no more or less likely to come down with the syndrome , but they may be more likely to receive an earlier diagnosis
" an elite athlete might notice symptoms sooner , " @entity35 says
" when you 're running around huffing and puffing , your mouth is more likely to dry out sooner
another important symptom -- fatigue -- will slow them down and affect their performance
and if they develop joint and muscle pain [ that ] persists , that leads to further testing to try to figure out what 's wrong
" @entity0 : pain relief for athletes -- what works best ? there is no known cure for @entity9 's syndrome , but symptoms can be managed with both over-the - counter products like artificial tears and sugar - free lozenges and prescription immunosuppressive drugs
the condition disappears suddenly in about 5 % of cases , but the majority of people have lifelong problems
that does n't necessarily mean @entity1 is done with tennis for good
" most manifestations are treatable and in most cases we can restore people to healthy and productive lives , " @entity35 says
" whether we can return an elite athlete to competition , that 's another story , but we do feel the treatment makes a big difference
