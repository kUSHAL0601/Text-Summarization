-- four of @entity2 's neighbors said sunday they are pulling their ambassadors from the country in the wake of the impeachment of @entity2 's president
@entity8 and @entity9 recalled the ambassadors hours after @entity11 and @entity12 -- two of @entity2 's most important neighbors -- did the same
@entity15 recalled its ambassador on saturday
@entity9 president @entity17 also said his country is halting all shipments to @entity2
@entity11 's foreign ministry said the action was due to the " breakdown of democracy " in @entity2 , and vowed to take up the impeachment with the regional blocs @entity25 and @entity27
the moves follow the lightning - quick removal from office of president @entity31 on friday
the impeachment procedures appear to have been carried out in accordance with the @entity2 constitution , but some @entity36 presidents call it a coup d'etat and refuse to recognize the new president , @entity39
@entity31 went from president to disgraced leader in less than 48 hours
the former @entity43 bishop was unpopular with lawmakers , and many had concerns about his credibility after he he admitted to fathering at least two children while still in the priesthood
in all , four women claim they had babies by @entity31 while he was bishop
but nine days ago , there was no reason to believe that @entity31 would find himself out of a job before his term ended in august 2013
then @entity2 impeached its president so fast that its neighbors needed a few days to figure out how to react
by sunday , @entity11 and @entity12 were expressing deep concerns
@entity11 's foreign ministry condemned the president 's removal and @entity12 's president said it was n't in line with democratic practices
@entity2 swears in new leader after impeachment there had been calls in the past for the impeachment of @entity31 , but the scandals did not rock his position too much
that changed on june 15 , when police and landless peasants clashed in eastern @entity2 , resulting in 17 deaths
peasants fired on police who were trying to evict them from private property , initiating the deadly confrontation , local authorities and state - run media said
the violence occurred in @entity84 , a remote community about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) northeast of the @entity2 capital , @entity87 , near the @entity11 border
in response to the incident , @entity31 replaced his national police chief and interior minister
the country 's liberal party , which backed @entity31 , were incensed to learn that the new minister was from another party
as the outcry over the deadly clash continued , the liberal party announced thursday that it was withdrawing its support of @entity31 , and an impeachment vote was heard in the lower chamber of congress that day
the vote in favor of impeachment was 76 - 1
the next day , @entity31 's defense team had two hours to defend @entity31 from what it call vague charges of incompetence
the @entity112 impeached the president in a 39 - 4 vote
@entity31 said @entity2 history and democracy had been " deeply wounded
" the presidents of @entity9 , @entity15 , @entity120 , @entity121 and the @entity122 said they will not recognize @entity39 's administration
@entity125 's foreign ministry and @entity9 's @entity17 said the speed in which @entity31 was removed did n't give him time to mount a proper defense
@entity39 reiterated that the impeachment happened within the parameters of the constitution , and pointed to the large margins by which @entity31 was voted out of office
" it means that here we have a unanimous position
the @entity2 people , i think , are satisfied with this decision , " he said
despite the cold shoulder from neighboring countries , @entity39 said he will reach out and explain the legality of @entity31 's ouster and seeks to have good international relations
his goal is for @entity2 to be recognized internationally by the time he hands the government over to the next president next year , he said
most of the countries opposed to @entity39 's presidency belong to the @entity27 , known as @entity27
the foreign ministers of that regional body were in @entity2 to study the issue
the @entity152 also weighed in a more neutral manner
" we urge all @entity2 to act peacefully , with calm and responsibility , in the spirit of @entity2 's democratic principles , " @entity155 spokeswoman @entity154 said
@entity0 's @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .
