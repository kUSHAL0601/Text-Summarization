-- @entity2 's president says devastating flooding forced him to cancel his scheduled trip to the @entity6 climate change conference in @entity7 this week -- even though global warming itself could be causing the disaster his country faces
" i canceled the trip i was taking to @entity15 ... to attend the international conference on climate change , which is what is affecting us , but i canceled this meeting , " president @entity12 said in a statement sunday
at least 194 people were killed and 248 injured after torrential rains in @entity2 that have affected nearly 1.6 million people , according to the country 's interior ministry
the downpours have caused landslides and overflowing rivers , destroying at least 2,040 houses and damaging nearly 270,000 more nationwide , the ministry said
rescue crews continued to work monday after a landslide in the suburbs of @entity36 , @entity2 , buried between 30 and 50 homes , @entity32 national deputy director @entity31 told @entity0
up to 150 people were affected , he said
as of monday night , they had found 23 bodies , @entity41 said , and more than 120 others could still be trapped underground
better weather on monday helped rescuers , but there was so much water on the ground that further mudslides were a risk , he said
@entity52 cradled her head in her hands and held back tears as she described the search for her family members
" two little girls , my sister - in - law and my niece -- they are trapped and they have n't been found , " @entity52 told @entity58
" they have n't been able to get them out
" the landslide occurred sunday afternoon , while volunteers elsewhere in the province of @entity67 held a telethon to raise money for winter weather victims
" from this tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country , we are going to forge ahead , " @entity12 said sunday after flying over some of the most severely affected areas , according to a statement on the government 's website
@entity2 is considering declaring a state of emergency to devote more resources to response and rescue efforts , @entity12 said , noting the number of victims throughout the country could climb to 2 million
@entity0 's @entity87 and @entity88 contributed to this report .
