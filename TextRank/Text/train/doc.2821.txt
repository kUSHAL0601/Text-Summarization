@entity0 -- a coalition of liberal and progressive groups , including unions and civil rights activists , rallied in @entity0 saturday to press for good jobs , immigration and education reform and to make a show of strength one month out from midterm elections
the " @entity13 " rally was held at the @entity14 , just five weeks after @entity16 enthusiasts met in @entity0
@entity18 president @entity17 told @entity1 the " @entity20 " movement is not " the alternative to the @entity16 , we 're the antidote to the @entity16
" @entity17 said he welcomes @entity16 members , but takes issue with extremists in the movement who critics say harbor racist views
still , @entity17 says he invited a well - known conservative to speak at saturday 's rally
he refused to name the person , who did not address the group
it was not immediately clear why
@entity17 said the coalition of liberal organizations came together to offer a positive alternative to negative rhetoric , and to demand better education and more economic opportunities
the " @entity20 " movement , he said , would rather see jobs for 99 percent of @entity41 instead of tax cuts for one percent of @entity41
" we want @entity41 to be something that represents every kind of diversity in this country , " said @entity43 , with the @entity44 , who attended the rally
" we 're here because we want to show that we have a presence and that we want @entity41 to head in the right direction
" the rally began with an @entity56 service at 11 a.m. et. as the service started , crowds were already beginning to thicken at the @entity58 near the @entity14 , where the rally took place
rally signs range from benign to fiery
they include : " @entity63 is what 's @entity65 , " " @entity66 , " @entity68 , " " @entity67 to be a @entity69 , " " stand with @entity70 , " " @entity71 , " " no cuts to @entity73 " and " @entity74 - @entity16 , republicans , @entity75
" organizers claim a wide range of supporters , some of whom are already associated with liberal causes -- like union workers , environmentalists , gay activists and student leaders
but " @entity20 " also claims backing from less obvious quarters -- like senior citizens , veterans and faith leaders
the group 's website sets out a list of basic principles and priorities
these include direct assistance for unemployed workers and assistance for small businesses and local governments trying to hire new workers ; a minimum wage increase ; health care reform ; immigration policy changes ; increased bankruptcy and foreclosure protection ; and more money for education , from kindergarten through college
the rally comes on the heels of another rally by conservatives in august
commentator @entity115 drew @entity16 activists to the @entity14 for his revival - style rally august 28
the timing and site of the rally provoked controversy among civil rights activists because it was on the 47th anniversary of the rev. @entity126 's " @entity127 " speech and in the same place
around noon saturday , a variety of speakers and performers began to take the stage
the program mixed speeches by activists and orators with music , historical readings , and even video clips
among those who spoke was the rev. @entity141 , who used the opportunity to urge people to get involved and vote in the next election
" we 've got to get ready for the midterm exam
we ca n't stop in ' 08 ! " he said to roaring applause .
