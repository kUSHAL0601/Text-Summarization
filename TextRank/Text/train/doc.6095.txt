@entity1 , @entity0 -- a man walks around the side of a building , footsteps falling in time to the heartbeat of a driving pop soundtrack , pulls out a pistol and guns down another man
@entity11 as arch - manipulator and seven time @entity13 prime minister , @entity12 , in @entity16 's " @entity15
" a montage of grisly murders follows , all with the same infectious pop song pounding in the background
it 's edge - of - the - seat stuff and it 's only the opening sequence of gifted @entity13 director @entity16 's biopic of @entity13 politician @entity12 , " @entity15
" @entity16 's film chronicles the career of probably the most important and controversial politico in @entity13 's recent history
but , more than that , it pins @entity12 to the specimen board and dissects his character without mercy
the film caught the eye of the judges at @entity36 last year where it picked up the @entity38
predictably , @entity12 did n't react well to the film
" he was very angry , " recalls @entity16
now 91 years - old , @entity12 has been prime minister of italy seven times
his @entity42 was the leading force in @entity13 politics as a one - party system for four decades
the rules of the game were shattered in the early 1990s by " @entity48 " or @entity48 -- a corruption scandal that laid bare some of the government 's unsavory practices , ruining careers and resulting in the suicides of some leading politicians
@entity12 himself was implicated in illegal activities , including connections to the @entity58 , but was finally acquitted of all charges
today , he is a senator for life
something of the man 's influence in all spheres of @entity13 public life becomes clear when @entity16 -- who says he is not a political director , " only in this case " -- explains how hard he found it to fund the film
" in @entity13 nobody wanted to finance the film because everybody was scared , " @entity16 told @entity2
" he has been a very powerful man for many years
" @entity16 managed eventually to secure funding from a private source
" it is not easy for @entity13 companies to put money in this project , so we did it with the private money of very courageous individuals , " he said
@entity16 picks up the @entity12 story at the beginning of the 1990s , just prior to his implication in the scandal , as he is about to assume power for the seventh time
a good deal of " @entity15 's " success lies in a stunning portrayal of @entity12 by @entity92 - born actor @entity11 , who is a veteran of three of @entity16 's other films including 2006 's " @entity95
" @entity96 's @entity12 is a stiff , impassive tortoise of a man
with a hunched back , skinny sloping shoulders and strange drooping ears , @entity12 appears physically frail
he is beset by headaches -- indeed , the opening scene of the film shows him with a head full of acupuncture needles trying to get rid of one -- a taste of the mix of drama and humor that informs the rest of the film
but where the body is weak the will is strong and in @entity12 's wit and cunning intelligence -- " i know i 'm an average man , but looking around i do n't see any giants " -- there is a sense of a man who can and will do anything to stay in power
" i have always wanted to make a film about @entity12 , " says @entity16
" he is so psychologically complex that everyone has been intrigued by him over the years
" it 's a political film but at the same time a film about a complex character from a psychological point of view
" for a long time , though , @entity16 was convinced that the vast amounts of literature written about the man could never be distilled into a structure that would work on film -- " it made my head spin , " he remembers
while @entity16 almost had too much material to mine while researching @entity12 's public life , it was impossible to get access to details of his home life
@entity16 had to go on instinct and imagine life behind the scenes for the great man
something that made aspects of @entity12 's response to the film very puzzling
" he told everything was false , a lie , about his public life and at the same time he said the film was very precise about his private life , " recalls @entity16
" but all the public things in the film are documented
it 's on record that the events took place
" the trials , the letters , the diary of @entity167 , the prime minister who was kidnapped by the @entity168 and held in captivity for 55 days
( @entity12 was prime minister at the time and decided not to negotiate with the terrorists and they killed him
) " and about the private life i invented everything
" one of the most surprising things about the 39 - year - old director 's film is the soundtrack
full of rock , pop , electronica -- " @entity184 " by @entity185 an indie band from @entity187 and " @entity188 " by @entity190 electro artists @entity191 -- mixed in with classical music like @entity182 and @entity183
it 's incongruous but it delivers a hefty emotional punch
" the idea was to make a rock opera about a man very far from rock , " says @entity16
" i did n't want to do a traditional biopic
