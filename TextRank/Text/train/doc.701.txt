-- " if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures , then there was something gorgeous about him , some heightened sensitivity to the promise of life , as if he related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away
this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ' creative temperament ' -- it was an extraordinary gift for hope , a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again
no -- @entity24 turned out all right at the end ; it is what preyed on @entity24 , what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short - winded elations of men
" â € @entity38 @entity37 , @entity39 seriously , now ... how can any movie director achieve a stretch of moving images that can even sneak up on the ineffable beauty , the limpid grace , the near - magical intersection of metaphor and tone found in such prose ? you 'd be just as well off trying to " adapt " one of @entity52 ' odes or @entity54 's pastorals into a filmed version
" @entity56 : @entity57 , " anyone ? again , seriously , why ca n't filmmakers let " @entity39 " be ? mostly because the rest of us ca n't
though @entity37 's 1925 masterwork was regarded as something of a failure in his brief , sad lifetime , it has since the 1940s steadily risen in the kind of popularity broad enough to take in generations , cultural backgrounds and whole nations
there have been five attempts to make a movie version of @entity37 's @entity77 tale about a wealthy young man with a mysterious , vaguely sinister past and how , having reinvented himself , sets about trying to reinvent his romantic destiny
@entity83 @entity82 's turn at bat with this @entity85 opened friday with @entity86 playing the eponymous @entity24 , @entity87 as his circumspect neighbor @entity39 and @entity89 as @entity91 's moneyed cousin @entity90 , the glistening , potential fulfillment of @entity24 's dearest ( or , maybe direst ) wishes
reviews , saying the least , have been mixed , with some , like the @entity97 's @entity96 declaring it a " failure " and the @entity100 @entity99 describing it as " audaciously miscalculated " while others , notably the @entity103 ' @entity102 and @entity105 's customarily finicky @entity104 , admit being entertained by what @entity102 characterizes as a " splashy , trashy opera
" news : ' @entity110 ' novels ? no such thing , says @entity112 such impressions seem to have been anticipated because of @entity82 's reputation for mounting such gaudily apportioned accounts of thwarted love as 1996 's " @entity117 " ( which also starred @entity86 ) and 2001 's " @entity118 ! " even those who praise the movie do so acknowledging its lavish set pieces ( oh , those parties ! ) , its hyped - up theatricality and its often - anachronistic musical background ( oh , that hip - hop ! )
but as @entity104 writes , " for all its computer - generated whoosh and overbroad acting , ( the movie ) is unmistakably @entity38 @entity37 's ' @entity39
' that is no small deal
" what @entity104 means ( and i agree ) is that @entity82 's " @entity24 , " in ramping up the opulence of the era and the intensity of the romance , comes closer than any previous movie adaptation so far in touching the emotional spirit of @entity37 's novel
but the story 's visceral appeal presents a problem for those who contend that the novel 's poetic language and resonant imagery are merely cloaking devices for what amounts to a thin , lurid storyline that would barely pass muster in a bottom - feeding pulp magazine
in a meticulous deflation of the book 's repute found on the same @entity105 website as @entity104 's review , writer @entity153 's disdain even spreads to the characters , none of whom she regards " as likeable
none of whom are even dislikeable , though nearly all of them are despicable
" look : @entity24 's @entity165 : 8 grand estates one could argue that the shallowness of @entity37 's glamorous strivers is precisely the novel 's point
the " abortive sorrows and short - winded elations " to which @entity37 refers in the opening quote account to most , if not all , of @entity177 's transient aspirations , practically from the country 's inception
moreover , theirs is the kind of shallowness upon which we can repeatedly project not just our own apprehensions of desire but those of everyone we know and will come to know throughout our lives
and so what if the novel 's skeleton is little more than pulp ? what would have happened if the storyline were any more elaborately designed ? would it have become even more lachrymose ? or more farcical ? something would have been thrown off - balance
with each rereading , one finds that @entity37 made all the right choices and arranged them all with as much precision as he was able to summon
this also applies to the language -- which has left many so dumbstruck with wonder and admiration that it threatens to paralyze even one 's effort to express admiration for it
recall 1974 's more immaculately fashioned movie version of " gatsby , " which was directed by ace literary adaptor @entity212 ( " @entity214 " ) , boasted a screenplay by " the @entity217 's " @entity216 and starred @entity218 as @entity24 , @entity219 as @entity90 and @entity220 as @entity91
that film was enormously faithful to @entity37 's novel -- and not much else
@entity82 's , for the record , is just as faithful
but @entity212 's film of " gatsby " does n't so much render the book so much as one 's reverential reading of it
@entity82 's response is more rapturous and unruly -- and , perhaps , this brings it closest of all to the spirit of the emotionally clumsy but romantic dreamer who created this enduring story in the first place
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .
