now that @entity0 and @entity1 have secured their spot on the @entity5 stage through 2015 , what do they have to say about how things went last year and what audiences can expect in the future ? well , the @entity11 talked with @entity0 this morning about her initial hosting experience and what her job as co-host really means
awards show tracker " well last year was really fun ! we did n't know what to expect
it was exciting to work with @entity1 , as always , and it was a strange experience , " @entity0 said
" we had a lot of fun so we said maybe we can try it again and like fools we are giving it another shot
looking forward to understanding more of how the night goes and what works and what does n't
in all honesty — just setting the tone for a really fun evening
i think as a host that 's your job
telling some jokes , getting everyone excited and then stay out of everyone 's way
" and now that the gig is booked , when will @entity0 and @entity1 get together and start working on their best jokes ? believe it or not , not right away
" i ca n't stress enough how little we will prepare until very close to the show
we 'll treat it like @entity46 — its a little @entity48 style and have to work backwards
we get a lot of jokes , write our own , talk bits and we work through them
you ca n't really do this kind of stuff too early and you ca n't overthink it , " @entity0 said
special coverage : @entity57 2014 but planning aside , the highlight of @entity0 's hosting duties last year ( a.k.a. the thing that probably helped get her back ) will surprise absolutely no one
" my highlight was sitting on @entity65 's lap. but it all felt like a highlight
" everyone saw that answer coming , right ? see the original story at @entity70 .
