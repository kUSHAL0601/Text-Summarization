@entity0 -- three security contractors , two of them @entity4 veterans and one from @entity7 , have been freed in @entity8 almost three weeks after they were detained by the @entity9 , @entity4 rep. @entity10 said wednesday

" @entity10 said he got involved after being contacted by the wife of one of the men , @entity9 veteran @entity23 of @entity24 , @entity17
the other two contractors are @entity26 of @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 of @entity7 , he said
the congressman asked the @entity31 for help and wrote to @entity8 prime minister @entity33 to appeal for their release , he said in a statement
@entity10 said the three men were detained because the @entity8 military " did not like the ' mission request authorization ' paperwork that had been issued by the @entity8 @entity39
" the @entity4 is still negotiating with the @entity8 government about whether @entity4 contractors will be granted any diplomatic protections under @entity8 law
