@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 the movie has already made more than $ 300 million at the box office worldwide and @entity7 tourism officials are hoping it means money for them too
@entity7 's tourism board has been promoting films for the past 15 years , so they know just how lucrative a movie like " @entity4 " can be
" to give you an example of a typical blockbuster film , it is normally seen by about 120 million people in the first three weeks of opening , " @entity13 official @entity12 told @entity2
" even if a small percentage of those come to visit @entity7 as a result of this particular film , that 's going to have a huge boost in some of those tourism attractions featured in our promotion
" as much of " @entity4 " is set in @entity0 this means big business for museum officials and gift shop operators
the @entity32 at @entity33 is the address where the fictional detective lived , according to the stories by @entity37
nearby , a nine - foot statue of @entity4 greets visitors at the baker street underground station
inside the museum , visitors can check out @entity4 ' study , sit in his armchair by the fireside , examine his calabash pipe and observe his chemistry equipment
" i think @entity49 has put its magic touch on the legend , and they 've put , as it were , a magnifying glass over the character and of course things you could say are slightly exaggerated , but that 's the wont of @entity49 and that 's what makes these blockbusters successful , " @entity48 , assistant curator of the @entity32 said
" so any new perspective , any new angle always just helps to perpetuate the legend of @entity4
and that indirectly will obviously benefit the museum
" about 70,000 visitors a year stop by the @entity68 lodging house , though officials are expecting a spike of interest fueled by the new movie
while thousands of tourists flock to visit the museum , many of its visitors are unaware that @entity4 was actually not real person
" a few people do think he is a real character , particularly with the tour of his house on ' @entity33 ' adding fuel to the fire so to speak , " @entity77 from @entity13 said
" that is just testament to @entity37 's brilliant writing with his true to nature locations in the books meaning tourist can really relate and visit all the fantastic locations
" @entity91 and @entity92 contributed to this report .
