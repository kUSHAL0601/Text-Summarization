-- marine biologists have a mystery to solve : why have the carcasses of two rare oarfish washed up on @entity6 shores within a week ? sightings of the huge deep - sea creatures -- dead or alive -- are unusual , because they typically swim thousands of feet below the surface
a dead 14 - foot - long oarfish came ashore in @entity11 , @entity6 , on friday afternoon , according to an @entity11 police dispatcher
a representative of the @entity16 was called to haul the serpent - like fish away for study , she said
a group of third - graders on a beach study trip made the discovery , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity24
the incident is especially puzzling because of the discovery made five days earlier by a marine science instructor while snorkeling off @entity28
@entity29 was about 15 feet underwater when she found an 18 - foot - long oarfish floating nearby
" i was first a little scared , " said @entity31 , who has been working for @entity32 since january
" but when i realized it was an oarfish , i knew it was harmless
" giant eyeball washes up on beach it took @entity31 15 minutes to drag the dead fish ashore , where 14 others helped lift the 400 - pound carcass out of the water
" i was really amazed
it was like seeing something in a dream , " said @entity43 , the senior captain of @entity32 's sailing school vessel the " @entity45 " who gave @entity31 a hand
" it 's the first time i ever witnessed an oarfish this big
" @entity53 makes a splash : the rarest whale @entity56 , a scientist with the @entity57 , was on hand friday to take a look at the @entity11 oarfish
" it 's so rare to find in @entity6 , especially in surface water , " @entity56 told @entity24
" they thought it was a very rare event the first time , so these two events that we heard of in the last few weeks are the only ones i 've ever heard of
" spiders had ancient , big - clawed relatives the @entity32 , a nonprofit marine science education group , said oarfish " are rarely seen , dead or alive
" " it is believed that oarfish dive over 3,000 feet deep , which leaves them largely unstudied , and little is known about their behavior or population
" @entity43 , who has been with @entity32 since 1994 , said it remains unclear why the oarfish was found in shallow water this time , but it appeared to have died naturally

@entity43 said @entity32 will likely to keep the fish 's skeleton for educational purposes
