president @entity0 talked openly last week about a candid conversation with a group of at - risk kids in @entity4 , and many of us parents took notice
" i explained to them when i was their age , i was a lot like them , " the president said , referring to the @entity9 boys he met with at @entity4 's @entity10 on the city 's south side last year
" i did n't have a dad in the house
and i was angry about it , even though i did n't necessarily realize it at the time
i got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do
" young men of color , share your advice the president 's honesty with teens about using drugs led many of us parents to ask : would we do the same with our children ? would we tell them that we tried drugs or used them repeatedly ? is sharing that information a good idea , or could it backfire ? my girls , ages 6 and 7 , are still too young for this conversation , in my humble opinion
but i have wondered whether i 'd one day tell them that yes , i did get high -- but just once ! thankfully , i never really used drugs , but alcohol is a whole different story
would i tell my girls about how i drank way too much too many times to remember during my college years , all while i was under the legal drinking age ? coming from a family that has battled alcoholism -- and cognizant of how there can be a genetic predisposition to the disease -- i feel my husband and i most definitely need to have the conversation when our girls are old enough
@entity66 , a @entity68 contributor and mom of a 6 - year - old daughter , agrees
her husband is a recovering drug addict
his addiction caused them to separate for a little more than a year
they have been back together since 2011
" i met my husband when he was 19 , and at that time he had only smoked weed once , " said @entity75 , who is founder of the blog @entity77 in @entity78 she said he then fell in with the " wrong people at the wrong time
" " he said it was like something in him just clicked when he started doing drugs
had he been told about his family 's predisposition , he may have made a different choice
but , we 'll never know
in order to give our daughter the best shot of making the right choice , we want her to know
" @entity94 has already had the conversation with her daughter , who is 7
sober for 18 years , @entity94 has told her daughter in very general terms that she 's a recovering drug addict and alcoholic and that addiction is a family disease
" that is why i 'm honest about my addiction , and i also tell her that she 's at risk and needs to make smart decisions
at her age , this likely goes over her head , but i tell her anyway , " said @entity94 , who writes for @entity68 and hosts a blog at @entity105
tv host @entity110 , a mother of three , says she has been very open with her kids about never having used drugs
that admission was n't exactly helpful at first , she concedes
" they regarded me as a total anomaly who might not understand the pressures kids are facing today concerning drugs , " said the children 's television host and social media specialist , who is also a @entity68 contributor
" but when i talked with my kids in more detail about the pressure i experienced to ' party , ' particularly in the entertainment industry , they came to recognize that i had an even greater understanding of what kids are going through
" miss @entity110 , who regularly talks to her children about drugs ( and sex , alcohol and money ! ) , says the thinking that you , as a parent , can lie or hide your experiences from your kids without consequence " is a fantasy
" " if you want your children to be forthright with you , should n't you show them the same respect ? besides it 's not about what you did or did n't do , it 's about why you made the choices you did and what effect they had on your future , positive or negative
" the best lessons as parents , says @entity155 , a writer and mom of two small children in @entity158 , @entity159 , do n't come from our " perfect " moments but from when we admit mistakes and show our kids how we try to learn from them
with that philosophy in mind , @entity155 , host of a blog in her own name , plans to tell her kids when they 're older how she got drunk in college
" how i let it happen , " said @entity155 , " and some stories of what happened after
" " maybe not all the stories , but i will always do my best to answer questions as honestly as possible , " said @entity155
" it 's not going to be pretty
" @entity175 , a mom of two and founder of the blog defining my @entity178 , said her mother was very honest growing up , and she plans to be the same with her children once they get older
" my mother was fairly open with my siblings and i about her past and the mistakes she made
she did this in hopes that we would learn from them , " said @entity175
" i really took what she shared to heart and was fairly straight - edge growing up
i was too scared by the stories she had shared
" of course , a big question for parents is whether talking about past drug use will make our children more or less likely to try drugs when they 're older
while @entity175 says her mom 's open approach did deter her from doing anything serious , she 's seen plenty of other cases where candor did n't exactly have the desired effect
" i have seen ... parents be completely open and their kids end up engaging in the same ways and amounts they did ... the whole , ' well , you did it ' argument , " said @entity175
@entity212 , an author and parenting expert , calls this a tricky issue for parents , namely because drugs are a " different animal " today than when we were in school
" just getting high today is not what just getting high 20 or 30 years ago was , " said @entity212
marijuana is , on average , more potent than it was in the 1970s
also , drugs like heroin are becoming more popular with teenagers , and even more deadly when laced with narcotics
whether to talk to your children about your drug past depends on your individual situation , she says
if a child is using drugs to try and fit in , and the parent did the same thing , the parent can relate their story to let them know they understand how their child feels
" make it a learning experience , " said @entity212 , author of the book " @entity242 : advice and @entity246
" " it needs to be a situation that relates to the parent and teen
" on the other hand , if the children need rehab or detox , telling them you did drugs could become an excuse where they say , ' @entity258 did it , so why ca n't i ? " " said @entity212
@entity260 , a public relations executive and motivational speaker who lives outside @entity262 , never experimented with drugs
knowing her mom abandoned her as an infant because she was under the influence of drugs was one of the reasons , she said
she is part of a group of female professionals who speak to young , at - risk girls about the challenges of growing up
often , a member of the group who has a history of drug use will share her experience with the young women
" it gives the young ladies a chance to speak to someone who has been in their shoes ( or similar shoes ) and has gone on to become a successful adult
" you ca n't underestimate the power of seeing someone who has been in a place similar to where they are today and who has gone on create a successful life , said @entity260
one of the students president @entity0 met with last year said as much
last week , as the president shared what he told a group of teens about his past , he remembered the reaction
" after i was finished , the guy sitting next to me said , ' are you talking about you ? ' i said , ' yes
' " would you talk to your kids about your past drug or alcohol use ? @entity309 in below in the comments or tell @entity311 on @entity312 or @entity313 on @entity314 .
