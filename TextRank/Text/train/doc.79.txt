-- the @entity2 voted tuesday to deny mayor @entity4 's request for taxpayers to pay his legal fees associated with a sexual harassment lawsuit against him , a spokesman said
the vote was 9 - 0 , according to @entity9 , spokesman for city council member @entity10
the city is named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit against @entity4
his former spokeswoman filed the suit alleging both were responsible for the mayor 's sexual harassment
@entity20 says it should n't be part of the lawsuit in the first place because it had no role in the mayor 's behavior and because it has a zero - tolerance policy against sexual harassment
the city " believes that it neither caused nor contributed to the damages alleged by " @entity4 's former spokeswoman , @entity31
amid calls for resignation , embattled mayor to enter clinic it 's a complicated situation
@entity38 and seven other women say they were subjected to " crude and disgusting " comments and inappropriate touching -- including groping and kissing -- by @entity4 , and she resigned as his spokeswoman in june
eight days ago , @entity38 filed suit against both @entity4 and the city , alleging both were responsible
@entity4 , 70 , then sent a letter to the city , saying it should mount his defense and pay his legal bills
opinion : no room for lecherous mayors the @entity2 met earlier tuesday and unanimously decided to file suit against @entity4 , saying it is the mayor who should pay the city 's legal bills in defending the case
and if @entity38 wins her case , the city 's lawsuit seeks indemnity from paying any damages
" @entity4 ca n't pay back @entity68 for the damage he 's done to our city 's reputation , but he can and should repay the city if there are any taxpayer costs as a result of this lawsuit , " @entity10 said in a statement
@entity20 mayor sued , called unfit for office @entity4 says he will enter a behavior counseling clinic next month for two weeks of " intensive therapy , " but he has repeatedly said he wo n't step down
his decision is unlikely to quell the mounting calls for his resignation
many of the accusations allegedly took place during @entity4 's five terms in @entity89 , before he was elected mayor last year
in response , @entity4 's chief of staff resigned , the @entity93 of @entity20 voted to call for his resignation -- even his fiancee left his side
a group began an official recall effort , but political observers have expressed doubt that the group can logistically pull off collecting the more than 100,000 signatures needed
secrets that women of @entity20 no longer keep about its mayor @entity0 's @entity105 contributed to this report .
