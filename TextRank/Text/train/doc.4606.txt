@entity0 , @entity1 -- a public memorial service for heavy metal rocker @entity4 is planned for sunday , with members of the @entity7 saying they will picket the ceremony
the church in @entity10 , @entity11 , is known for its intolerance of gays and its picketing of soldiers ' funerals
a picketing schedule on the church 's website said protesters will be at the @entity4 memorial at @entity22 in @entity0 , accusing the 67 - year - old rocker of worshipping @entity24
@entity4 died on may 16 after a battle with stomach cancer
charges of devil - worshipping have often been leveled against heavy metal music
@entity4 , in particular , was a favorite target
he popularized the " devil 's horn " gesture , where the index and the little fingers are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers
he has said he was taught by the sign by his superstitious @entity40 grandmother as a way to ward off the " evil eye
" but many fundamentalist christians have taken issue with the gesture , alleging that it is a tribute to the devil
" @entity4 hates prejudice and violence
we need to turn the other cheek on these people that only know how to hate someone they did n't know , " said @entity4 's wife , @entity49 , about the planned protest
@entity4 said the memorial will host a donation center for her husband 's " @entity58 and @entity59 , " named after one his songs
@entity4 most recently was touring with @entity62 , a version of @entity64 renamed for legal reasons
all shows were canceled last march because of his illness
his last public appearance was in april at the @entity69 , when he accepted a vocalist of the year award for his work on last year 's @entity62 album
@entity4 appeared frail , but he spoke while accepting his award
born @entity4 in 1942 , @entity4 's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s
his 1960s rock group @entity77 evolved into elf by the early 1970s , when the group played heavy blues rock
@entity4 's rock became darker with his band @entity82 , which he left in 1979 to join @entity64
@entity64 released three albums with @entity4 , including " @entity62 " in 1980 , " @entity84 " in 1981 and " @entity85 " in 1982
@entity4 left that band in 1982 , but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later
he formed the group @entity4 in 1982 and later @entity62 .
