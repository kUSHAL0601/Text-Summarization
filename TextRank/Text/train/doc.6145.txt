-- it 's a campaign that 's raising a lot of eyebrows in @entity4
the campaign involves a 34 - year - old philosophy professor named @entity6 , who 's running for the @entity4 congress
when @entity6 realized her bid for office was off to a slow start a few weeks ago , the leftist candidate quickly decided she was going to be transparent with voters in a way they did n't expect
@entity6 decided to appear topless on a billboard surrounded by half - a - dozen supporters of her party , the @entity18 ( @entity18 )
the billboard shows the seven women , including @entity20 , naked from the waist up and covering sensitive areas with their right hands while they raise their left fists
the candidate says it 's her way of giving voters in @entity4 a wake - up call
we do n't seem to be aware of our role
we need to get energized
we need to tell people , ' hey , wake up because if you do n't , sharks are going to eat you up
wake up , you citizen and politician , " @entity6 said
a caption above the women on the billboard reads : " i dare you to build a new project for a nation with no prejudices
" another billboard shows the bare legs of four women with their pelvic areas covered with a semi-transparent yellow cloth
the caption on the cloth reads : " it 's better for one thousand of us to take a step forward than for one leader to take one thousand steps for us
" at a recent campaign stop in @entity58 , @entity6 shook hands with voters and high - fived one supporter
@entity6 heads the philosophy department at the @entity63
she says she has received strong support from most of her female students , " but some of my male students just look at me from a distance , " she said
so far @entity20 has posted the two billboards in @entity58 , @entity4 's second largest city and also one of the most conservative
she has been the target of harsh criticism and dismissed as a novice trying to make in politics no matter at what cost
" conservative people are never going to vote for me , never ! " @entity6 said
" even if i dressed as a nun and carried a rosary and said that my party was going to give away bibles and rosaries , they would n't
conservatives are never going to vote for me
" @entity6 also says she has the full backing of her family , including her elderly mother , whom she describes as a small - town , conservative woman
and if people were shocked by her first round of campaigning , @entity6 says , that is nothing compared with the second one she will unveil in the next few weeks , although she 's not giving out details
in the meantime , she has been targeted on social media
" who needs brains when you have these ? " reads one comment on @entity98
@entity6 says that wo n't deter her from advancing her political platform
the bottom line , @entity6 says , is that she 's a radical candidate with radical ideas for a better @entity4
" when it comes to drugs and the violence generated by drug trafficking , we need to start thinking in a radical way
what do i mean by that ? well , we need to start a debate
let 's legalize ( drugs ) , tax them and use the money for other things , " @entity6 said
@entity4 will hold presidential and congressional elections on july 1
in addition to a president , @entity4 will also elect 128 senators , 500 representatives , six governors , 375 local legislators and 641 mayors
