business stimulus package which his government hopes can stall falling growth and prevent the country joining other major @entity9 economies in recession
up to 1,000 projects will benefit from the package , which was first proposed by president @entity13 in december and approved by @entity2 lawmakers last week
around 20 billion euros of the total amount will be spent over the next 12 months
businesses will receive 11.4 billion euros while the same amount will be invested in public projects with social housing identified as a priority
the final 4 billion euros will be spent on improving @entity2 's transport , energy and postal service infrastructure
the package is expected to stimulate economic growth of around 1.3 percent , @entity1 said
@entity2 has so far avoided the worst of the recession that has gripped many of its western @entity9 neighbors , including @entity30 and the @entity31
but unemployment rose by a further 45,000 in december after surging by 64,000 in november , @entity2 finance minister @entity32 said monday , adding that she would be " very surprised " if @entity2 experienced positive growth in 2009
speaking to @entity0 this weekend at the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity32 , defended the case for public spending in the face of fears that stimulus packages amounted to storing up unmanageable debts for future generations
" when the house is on fire we do n't look at what can be built , @entity32 said
" we need to kick start ( the economy ) and we need to restore confidence
