-- @entity1 said he suffered from mental instability , frustration and depression
but as the 19 - year - old embarked on a planned massacre at a @entity8 facility north of @entity9 , he expressed no sadness , no regrets
" i 'm in my happy place , " @entity1 wrote
" i 'm in my happy place
i 'm in my happy place
" these and other jarring statements attributed to @entity1 , and released friday to @entity0 , do not offer a specific reason why @entity1 shot and wounded six people late last month at a @entity8 package and delivery facility in @entity18 , before turning a gun on himself
they do , however , help paint a picture of a man who felt isolated , did drugs and had mental issues
the violent outburst was n't the result of a sudden decision , he explained , but " more of a several - month snap
" " this was n't the result of media brainwashing and subliminal messages , " @entity1 said
" this is my own doing
i want to hurt people
" the @entity37 released the shooter 's apparent thoughts in the form of a pair of brief handwritten notes
one labeled " final requests " was found in @entity1 's vehicle outside the @entity8 facility , and the other is a three - page note titled " my final thoughts on paper " that was in his house in nearby @entity50
shortly before 6 a.m. on april 29 , @entity1 entered the 500,000 - square - foot facility and began shooting , according to police
authorities fielded " numerous " 911 calls in the immediate aftermath , according to @entity58 sgt. @entity57 , until @entity1 apparently killed himself
in the message later found in his car , @entity1 said that his " first choice for my massacre would start with anyone who sold me drugs and a few others
" he added that he 'd tried " to get help from ... a therapist , but i 've also medicated with several types of drugs , most of which were illegal
" @entity1 insists that no music or video games spurred his attack , saying without elaborating that " this was personally and , i guess , to a small extent politically motivated
" " i 'm not sad or sorry for the misery i 've caused , " he wrote
family is ' shocked and devastated '
