@entity1 , @entity0 -- prosecutors have dismissed all four charges against @entity6 , brother of former @entity0 gov. @entity7 , defense attorney @entity3 said thursday
" i was in shock and still am , " @entity3 said
he said that when he told his client , @entity6 said , " ' oh , my @entity10 ; oh , my @entity10
' and i told him , ' you 're done
' his wife is hysterical
" @entity3 said prosecutors told a judge at a hearing thursday that they were dropping the charges because of " the disparity in the roles between @entity6 and @entity7 " and " in the interests of justice
" on august 17 , after deliberating for 14 days , a jury in a federal corruption trial convicted @entity7 of lying to the @entity23 but said they were deadlocked on the other 23 counts against the former governor as well as the four against @entity6
prosecutors have vowed to retry @entity7 , who faced charges including racketeering , wire fraud , attempted extortion and bribery
the two - term @entity32 was removed from office in january 2009 amid accusations that he attempted to sell the @entity36 seat that @entity37 held before he was elected president
the former governor will be retried after the first of 2011 , said his lead attorney , @entity40 @entity40 indicated that he is not happy at the limit placed on the number of federally funded attorneys on @entity7 's legal team
@entity7 qualifies for a public defender , @entity47 district judge @entity46 said , and he will appoint two attorneys and possibly a paralegal , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity50
a pro bono attorney is allowed , but @entity7 must disclose the source of the funds if he has any paid representation , @entity46 said , according to @entity50
the last trial was funded with nearly $ 3 million in campaign money
" you saw what happened in court
we 're now down one defendant , one less charge , and we 're down about eight lawyers , " @entity40 said
he said he thought @entity46 was wrong to say he could appoint only two attorneys
attorneys in the case have gone through piles of papers and listened to hours of taped conversations
" we have millions of documents to go over
we had 20 people working full - time on this case , " he said
@entity40 said his next step will be to sit down with the former governor and " decide what is best for him
... that 's the only question that is important
" defense attorney @entity78 said prosecutors should now dismiss the case against @entity7
@entity40 said it could still happen , noting , " the government has done some strange things in this case already
" the former governor " is innocent of any crime , " @entity40 said
" you 've got to keep that in mind
" he said he is open to discussions with prosecutors , but has not been approached
@entity40 said he had not spoken to @entity7 and did n't know what his reaction would be to prosecutors dropping charges against his brother
@entity6 was charged with one count of wire fraud , one count of extortion conspiracy , one count of attempted extortion , and one count of bribery conspiracy
asked why prosecutors dismissed charges against @entity6 , @entity3 said , " i did n't ask , but i 'm not going to argue with them
" " what he 's been through , and what he thought he was going to go through again , and then out of nowhere , they dismiss the charges ... i 've been doing this a long time , and things like this do n't happen , " the attorney said
but " the evidence was far from great against him , " @entity3 said
" i 'm sure they know the jury was 9 - 3 for acquittal
" he said he was told that six women on the jury refused to convict @entity6 in any circumstances
he said @entity6 could be subpoenaed in his brother 's retrial
during the first trial , @entity6 testified his brother was " trying to politically work something to his benefit " in handling the @entity36 appointment , but was thinking in terms of political horse - trading , not corruption
in a conversation recorded by federal agents , the then - governor told an aide , " i 've got this thing , and it 's [ expletive ] golden
i 'm just not giving it up for [ expletive ] nothing
" " it did n't seem out of the ordinary , because @entity37 was taking a lot of people from @entity0 with him to @entity142 , " said @entity6 , who raised money for his brother
he said his brother " was interested in the idea of being the head of @entity145
" while awaiting trial , the ousted governor repeatedly asserted his innocence in interviews and on @entity150 , as well as during his appearances on the " @entity153 " reality show
