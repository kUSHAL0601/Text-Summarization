@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity6 song called " @entity7 " was recorded three years ago and is not about @entity8 , its producers said
@entity6 pleaded guilty in an assault case regarding his ex-girlfriend @entity8
the music appeared online tuesday , a day after the singer admitted guilt to assaulting @entity8 , his former girlfriend
@entity6 's record label also said the music was not " new
" although @entity6 accepted a plea deal in which he could avoid jail time , any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging , since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in august
the song , which appeared on @entity21 , includes the line " it 's not my fault , right ? " the publicist for the @entity26 , a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with @entity6 , said the music was a demo recorded three years ago
she said they do not know how the song made its way onto @entity21
@entity34 , which distributes @entity6 's music , said " there are no ' new ' songs from @entity6 currently being promoted by @entity6 or his record label
" " there are several old demos circulating that are being falsely promoted as new material from @entity6 , " a @entity34 statement said
in the song , @entity6 sings : " i picked up the paper and the headline reads , it says ' singer brokenhearted in some satin sheets
' and i 'm like , why ? we had a hell of a time
" " when i first met you , i told ya that you 'll be safe
in the midst of arguing something , falls to the floor and breaks
you look down and see what you dropped , oh , it 's your heart
" " shortie 's caught up from a long night
she 's ready to fall but she 's all right
that 's just something that can happen when you put it down
she 's caught up , it 's not my fault , right
" " you see , her mama called me , really steamed
she said ' my daughter wo n't eat and she do n't sleep
' " @entity6 was arrested in connection with an altercation that began with an argument with @entity8 inside a rented @entity72 on a @entity74 street in february
prosecutors agreed to recommend five years of probation and 180 days of community service for @entity6 in exchange for his guilty plea on one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury .
