the @entity0 voiced concern friday about the case of an @entity4 citizen in prison in @entity6 , whom a @entity8 report alleges was tortured
@entity10 was arrested in october 2012 on charges related to @entity13 protests against the @entity15 - led government for greater rights
he was sentenced a year later by a @entity6 court to 10 years in jail on charges of unlawful assembly , intent to kill police , destruction of police vehicles and possession of @entity27 cocktails
the @entity4 has said little about the case of @entity10 , born in @entity29 to a @entity31 father and a @entity6 mother , citing privacy laws
after his family produced a @entity37 waiver , authorizing the @entity4 government to talk about the case , the @entity0 finally said this week it had concerns about the fairness of @entity10 's trial , as well as his " safety and welfare , his treatment in prison , including his medical and nutritional needs
" " this a case that we 've taken very seriously , " said @entity49 , a @entity0 spokesman , indicating the government has raised this " at the highest levels of the government of @entity6
" the @entity6 government has denied the charges , insisting it has a " zero tolerance " policy on torture
a report by the @entity62 documents sources saying that @entity10 was forced to make a false confession under torture that he assaulted a police officer by throwing a stone at him
with no physical evidence , the conviction was based on that confession , the report said , adding that " mr. @entity10 and his mother were able to credibly testify that he was at home the time that the crime was allegedly committed
" the group called for @entity10 's release
a representative of @entity10 's family confirmed to @entity80 details in the @entity8 report , including that @entity10 says his confession was extracted by acts of torture , including beatings in the chest and head , forcing him to stand for long periods despite a spinal condition and denying him access to a bathroom
since his conviction , @entity10 has endured " further abuse and mistreatment , " according to the report and representatives of the @entity78
the @entity8 report said the government " did not provide any explanation or justification for these serious violations
@entity49 said @entity4 consular officers have visited @entity10 five times during his two - year detention and that in response to concerns , he has been given access to medical care
the case presents a dilemma for the @entity4 , which insists there is no greater priority than the protection of @entity4 citizens
the tiny @entity116 kingdom is a key @entity4 ally in an unstable region and home to the @entity121 's @entity120
most recently , @entity6 has taken part in airstrikes against @entity124 as part of the @entity4 - led coalition
@entity127 has tempered its concerns about @entity6 's human rights record and its heavy - handed crackdown on a popular uprising
local and human rights groups charge many @entity13 @entity6 youths have been arbitrarily arrested and jailed for alleged crimes against security forces
calling @entity10 's arrest and continued detention " arbitrary , " the @entity8 working group referred the allegations of his alleged abuse to the @entity141 on torture and called on the @entity6 government to immediately release him and grant him compensation for the " harm he has suffered
" the @entity6 court upheld the verdict on appeal , but @entity10 's lawyers say they have filed for another appeal and are waiting for a hearing date
@entity49 said the @entity0 expected the case to go to appeal , and in its discussions with the @entity6 government continues to address its concern over judicial proceedings in the case and " emphasize the importance of @entity6 's commitment to fair trial guarantees required by international law
" " this is a matter of ongoing concern , " @entity49 said .
