-- over the past month , we 've watched from distant shores as @entity3 has plunged into a debt crisis
mounting pressure from global financial markets forced @entity3 to begin a drastic austerity program
with a fiscal deficit of 8.1 percent of gdp and government debt of 115 percent of @entity9 expected this year , @entity3 has promised to turn itself around by 2013
to do this , the government has adopted an ambitious fiscal consolidation program that would reduce the annual deficit by 7 percent of gdp this year , 4 percent next year , and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013
the @entity15 and the @entity16 have announced an extraordinary $ 1 trillion package to support the plan , and the @entity19 has announced its own extraordinary measures
are there lessons the @entity23 can or should draw from the @entity3 situation ? first , we are not @entity3
the @entity23 is by far the world 's largest single economy
our economy is competitive , diversified and rich in human capital and natural resources
while the rest of the world is important for our growth , our domestic market is vast , which means that , unlike @entity3 , we can usually rely on domestic demand to drive the economy
at their best , our financial markets are dynamic , have deep pockets and provide the liquidity for our innovative economy
we issue the world 's reserve currency , which minimizes our currency market risk
and unlike @entity3 , because we have currency flexibility , we can adjust the value of the dollar to improve our underlying economic performance , if necessary
but we are facing very serious fiscal challenges , too -- and for many of the same reasons as @entity3
like @entity3 , our fiscal path is unsustainable for as far as the eye can see
our debt has surged far above what we have normally been able to manage
and unless fiscal policy changes , it is projected to continue heading up indefinitely
our debt - to - gdp ratio is projected to exceed 60 percent this year , well above our average for the past 40 years ( around 40 percent ) and close to a peacetime high
and it 's projected to keep on rising
like @entity3 ( and all advanced industrial countries ) , we can expect our fiscal situation to get worse in about 10 years , as the baby boomers ' retirement accelerates
in a generation , the debt is expected to be well over 150 percent of gdp
by 2050 , it 's projected to be over 300 percent and still heading upward
we can not sustain this much debt without a crisis
while the @entity23 may have more fiscal running room than @entity3 , we wo n't be able to outrun our creditors if they think we ca n't manage our fiscal affairs
the impasse in @entity76 is giving rise to jitters that we ca n't politically solve our problems , no matter how wealthy our economy
and as the past few weeks illustrate , if we lose credibility with creditors , they may downgrade our debt , demand higher interest rates , and in the worst case refuse to hold our debt because of fear of default
maintaining the confidence of our creditors is critical for the @entity23 : we depend on capital inflows to close our fiscal gap because our savings rate is so low
it is harder to rebuild confidence than to lose it
finally , as @entity3 so vividly illustrates , it is better act on your own timetable and according to your own priorities , rather than have actions forced upon you by financial markets
if the @entity23 can make fiscal changes sooner rather than later , once the economy is on a stronger footing , adjustment can be more gradual and less costly
then our citizens will be able to manage change more easily
what will it take for the @entity23 to get its fiscal house in order ? we need a plan
as we 've seen in @entity115 -- and even on @entity116 over the past week -- uncertainty sows fear , panic and unrest
but our fiscal future does not have to look like this
there is a way forward
@entity23 's first fiscal challenge is political will , not ability to pay
in partnership with the @entity23 people , @entity23 policymakers need to settle on a reasonable and sensible fiscal recovery plan soon that is credible to both the markets and the ultimate financier : the @entity23 taxpayer
it should be multiyear to reassure creditors and taxpayers that we can indeed manage our affairs over time and that it will not force draconian austerity , if done correctly
we need to know where we want to go and how we can get there
a clear road map for fiscal change will allow everyone to plan and manage , in contrast to the cold shower the @entity3 are being forced to take
in broad economic terms , the answer is simpler than most people realize
as most experts agree , we need to put the budget on track for stabilizing the debt at no more than 60 percent of gdp when we can realistically manage change
( the 60 percent threshold still has credibility for advanced industrial countries in the global marketplace
) although our debt is below that now , commitments already in place will put us on a higher path , even before the baby boomers start to retire
but we need to start phasing in policy changes soon to shift to a more sustainable debt path
much like a household budget , a fiscal recovery package also needs to be fair to succeed
any plan needs to reflect shared sacrifice
our fiscal problems are so big , everything has to be on the table
just cutting spending will savage government and prevent it from delivering the things we all rely upon to live our lives and to make them better
just raising taxes will take money from the poorest and the middle class and rob the country of needed incentives for the investments that boost higher growth
but within budget limits , we also must make sure that any fiscal package promotes our key values and needs : protecting the weakest among us and raising living standards through increasing human capital ( including education ) , promoting innovation and providing basic infrastructure
ultimately , getting our fiscal house in order is about shared sacrifice -- and shared hope
putting a fiscal recovery plan in place will hasten the recovery and make living standards higher than they would otherwise be
we do n't have to look like @entity3 does now
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .
