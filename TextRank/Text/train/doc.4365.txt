@entity0 -- @entity3 's demand that a transgender contestant be allowed to compete in the @entity6 pageant was trumped tuesday when pageant owner @entity7 agreed with her
it was a public relations battle featuring two well - known masters of the media , a beauty queen and a controversial topic
on the @entity13 was @entity7 , whose fortune and brand is boosted by his ability to navigate storms of controversy
on the @entity19 was @entity3 , legendary for her ability to draw hordes of cameras to her @entity24 law office to capture her outrage over alleged injustices done to her clients
the client is @entity29 , a 23 - year - old , 6 - foot - 1 - inch tall blond @entity30 , who underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago
@entity29 won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for @entity30 's national title , but she was then told the may 19 miss @entity6 pageant in @entity36 was only open to " naturally born females
" " i am a woman , " @entity29 said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in @entity3 's conference room tuesday
" i was devastated and i felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust
" @entity3 's statement attacked @entity7 for questioning @entity29 's sexuality
" she did not ask mr. @entity7 to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male , " @entity3 said
how she became a female is not important , she said
" the @entity50 competition is designed to find the one person in the world whose human qualities make them worthy of the @entity50 crown and title , " @entity3 said
" @entity29 is beautiful in every way
her life story will undoubtedly inspire people throughout the world
" @entity29 , in a 2010 interview , said she knew she was a girl at age 4
she said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19
@entity7 , warned of @entity3 's attack when the lawyer alerted reporters monday afternoon that she would hold the news conference , shifted his pageant 's position in an announcement monday night
@entity29 could compete provided " she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of @entity30 , and the standards established by other international competitions , " the @entity72 said
@entity7 's maneuver did n't appear to temper @entity3 's outrage
" the last - minute statement by mr. @entity7 's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue , " she said
" instead of stating clearly that @entity29 will be allowed to compete , mr. @entity7 qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous
" she asked @entity7 for " a clear answer -- not a wimpy , wishy - washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank
" @entity3 did n't know it then , but @entity7 gave a clearer statement to @entity1 in @entity92 two hours earlier
" we went by the laws of @entity30 and the laws of the @entity95 , and those laws say that she should be allowed to enter the pageant , " @entity7 said
" so she will be entering the @entity99 pageant
" when read @entity7 's new statement , @entity3 paused for several seconds and said " i stand by my statement
we want this rule eliminated
" " we want a clearer statement that this rule will be eliminated , " @entity3 said
" step up , say it loudly , say it clearly , this rule will never be in effect again for anyone
" @entity3 declined to have @entity29 react to @entity7 's decision to let her compete
" sorry , " @entity29 whispered to the reporter , apologizing for her silence
@entity3 would not say if her client still intended to compete in the pageant
controversy over pageant rules is not new for @entity7 , who owns and controls the @entity50 franchise
the media stir over @entity120 's same - sex marriage comments at @entity7 's @entity122 pageant three years ago raised the profile of that competition
@entity128 , in response to a question from a judge , declared her opposition to same - sex marriage
@entity7 initially said @entity128 could keep her miss @entity132 title despite a controversy over topless photos , missed appearances and her statements against same - sex marriage
he eventually fired her for " contract violations , " including missed public appearances
@entity3 has affected more than beauty contests
she hosted several news conferences in 2010 to reveal evidence that @entity144 , who was then the @entity145 nominee for governor of @entity132 , employed an undocumented worker
the october surprise hampered @entity144 's campaign at a crucial time in her race against @entity152 , who won the election .
