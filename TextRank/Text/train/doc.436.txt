-- an @entity2 charity may have come out ahead by turning down a gift from the nation 's largest retailer -- a snub that grabbed headlines and renewed interest in the labor practices of big business
@entity11 , a @entity12 - based food bank , rejected a $ 1,000 donation from @entity14 , joining a chorus of voices demanding better pay , fairer work schedules and affordable health care
the retailer had made $ 15,000 in donations to several charities as part of its typical outreach to community groups after opening a new store
but the @entity2 charity said tuesday that their snub netted much more than what @entity14 had offered after an outpouring of local donations came from those concerned about the store 's effect on union jobs and small businesses
and yet , it may have all stemmed from a simple mistake
on october 26 , @entity14 opened a new outlet in @entity12 , boasting 300 new jobs and pledging thousands to charities identified by local political leaders
" we had expected @entity44 to be at the grand opening , " said @entity42 , a @entity14 spokeswoman
but the food bank , which says it bags about 500 daily lunches for low - and no - income residents , never planned to attend
" we had a big meeting about it and decided not to take the money , " said charity organizer @entity49
but @entity14 still included the group in its news release , which it later called a miscommunication
" at that point , we had to do something , " said @entity49 , who wrote a letter entitled " correction " to the editorial board of his local newspaper
from there , the attention snowballed as news outlets reported on the defiant local charity that had rebuffed the retail giant
" at the very least , it got us talking about the ' @entity68 ' of @entity69 , and whether that 's a good thing , " said @entity49
and those concerned about the discount stores ' effects have continued opening their checkbooks , he added
" i do n't have a set dollar amount that we 've received , but i 'm sure it was substantially more than @entity14 offered us , " @entity49 said
" when people sent us checks , they also wrote ' thank for your stance on @entity14
' " the retailer responded tuesday with a statement detailing its " long history of supporting @entity12 nonprofits
" " since 2009 , @entity14 has donated more than $ 345,000 to local @entity12 organizations that are supporting the community 's needs , " it said
" our pay and benefits typically meet or exceed what 's offered by the majority of our competitors ; we promote from within , our turnover rate is below the industry average and our associates ' satisfaction scores have trended higher over the past few years
" the average wage of a full - time @entity14 employee in @entity2 is $ 12.52 per hour , with the company reporting that it picks up about 75 % of premium health care costs
but part - time employees who work fewer than an average of 30 hours per week do not qualify for those benefits
as a capital - versus - labor debate again flares up across the country , @entity49 's rebuff drew a heady response
" i have never given to @entity44 before but when i read about them rejecting a donation from @entity14 i sent them a check , " @entity12 resident @entity111 posted on @entity112
" i have never been in a @entity14 and never will
they have come into to many communities and put the small locally run businesses out of business
" but the move also sparked criticism about whether the group had shirked its main responsibility to feed the hungry
" i think that these people are horrible , " @entity125 posted on the site
" as a charity they should take what they can get
" the local spate coincided with @entity133 demonstrations at @entity14 over pay , schedules and health care
critics also say the stores ' low prices squeeze out mom - and - pop competitors , depress wages and encourage foreign - based manufacturing while discouraging unionized labor
supporters argue that @entity14 instead offers competitive wages and that its bargain prices foster consumer spending critical to a beleaguered economy
@entity14 and firms like it , they say , also give low - income households a chance to purchase otherwise unaffordable luxury products such as large - screen televisions and other electronics
so who 's right ? according to a 2008 study by @entity158 economics professor @entity157 , @entity14 has had no real impact on the number of small businesses in the @entity69
and while mom - and - pop stores that are forced to compete with the retail giant are often put out of business , other businesses have taken their place , the study found
others such as @entity169 , a professor of public policy at the @entity171 and a former @entity69 secretary of labor , argue that jobs filling those voids often offer low - wage , no - benefit occupations , limiting the purchasing power of @entity69 's middle class and poor
