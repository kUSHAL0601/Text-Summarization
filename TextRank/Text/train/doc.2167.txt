@entity0 , @entity1 -- a desperate @entity1 farmer fighting to hold onto his land -- a year after the country 's political rivals pledged to govern jointly -- fears he will eventually lose to politics and violence
@entity10 's farm was gutted by fire , as was his father - in - law 's
the power - sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in @entity1
@entity19 is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite president @entity23 's policy of redistributing white - owned farms to landless blacks
" why do they want to remove me when i 've complied with everything they want ? what more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that 's the case , then admit that that is the policy
pass a law : no whites are allowed to farm
then it makes it clear , " @entity19 said
since 2000 , @entity23 's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land , destroying @entity1 's once prosperous agricultural sector
" when the land reform program began , we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude ; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out
so i voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father - in - law 's farm , " @entity19 said
a year later the government came knocking on his door again , he said , demanding more land
@entity19 told @entity2 he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father - in - law 's farm , which he then owned
now an army general is demanding @entity19 's remaining 30 percent
when @entity1 's new unity government was formed -- with @entity23 's @entity61 and @entity63 's @entity62 -- in february this year , the general allegedly posted soldiers on @entity19 's farm
the farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point
when @entity2 visited @entity19 's farm this month , workers were standing idle
maize and tobacco , which @entity19 said is worth more than @entity74 $ 1 million , lay in storage
" they 've switched off our irrigation system , taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize , " he told @entity2
so @entity19 had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room
he took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted
with the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but @entity19 said : " nothing is happening here
there is no land audit happening , no one comes out here to check , to see
we are just left vulnerable
" on another farm , @entity10 's fight for his land has just escalated to another level
@entity10 has been repeatedly beaten , arrested and harassed
now his farmhouse and that of his father - in - law have been gutted by a mysterious fire
see the destruction the fire caused @entity10 could not say for sure that this is arson but told @entity2 that the group of @entity61 youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house
" one time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming
they were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you do n't get out , " he said
@entity10 and his father - in - law @entity123 are among a group of @entity1 farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern @entity131 tribunal
but @entity23 has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal
farmers can not contest land issues in @entity1 and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either
when @entity2 interviewed @entity23 's minister of state , @entity136 , about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms , he blamed the farmers for the violence , saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land
" human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites , and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us , it did n't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights
" and sometimes we say , good heavens , if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about , you better keep them away from us ; we do n't want to see them , " he told @entity2
but it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire
they continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated
some have even been killed
tractor driver @entity166 said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted
" they actually say you the workers , you are ones that are supporting the white farmer
that is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go , " @entity166 told @entity2
many farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before
@entity19 said : " when @entity61 was in power , you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us
but now that these positions are being shared with mr. @entity63 's @entity62 , mr. @entity23 has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program
and when it comes to the @entity62 , the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch
i have asked mr. @entity63 to intervene but nothing is happening
" prime minister @entity63 refuted that
" that is not true , " he said
" we initiated to find out who is being affected , the few remaining white farmers
let 's be frank here , we are talking of farmers as being white , but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture
there should be no disruption of any farm activity
" to those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win .
