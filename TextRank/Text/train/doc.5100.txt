-- if @entity2 feels threatened by @entity4 's arrival at @entity5 , it certainly is n't showing in his performances
@entity2 followed up his midweek @entity9 treble with another two goals in sunday 's 4 - 1 win over @entity12 , while this season 's marquee signing @entity4 was unable to make his home debut due to an injury suffered in the warmup
the win kept @entity5 in third place , two points behind @entity21 and @entity22 after five matches , and the double lifted @entity2 into fifth on the club 's all - time scoring list with 208
@entity2 failed to score in @entity5 's opening two @entity27 matches , but including his hat - trick for @entity30 in a @entity32 qualifier against @entity33 he now has 10 goals in his last five games -- fully vindicating the bumper new contract he signed after @entity4 arrived
@entity4 -- a world - record signing according to his former club @entity39 , but not as expensive as @entity2 was in 2009 according to @entity5 -- was replaced in the starting lineup at the @entity41 by the highly - rated @entity42 , another newcomer to @entity5
@entity4 scored on his debut in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity46 , playing an hour , and also came on to replace @entity42 in the 6 - 1 @entity9 thrashing of @entity48 -- but his only other time on the pitch this season is a substitute appearance for @entity53 before joining up with @entity55 's squad
" he had a small problem in the warmup
i do n't think it is a big problem , but we have to wait till tomorrow to do a scan to see how bad the injury is , " @entity55 told reporters
" the player was n't comfortable , he was worried , so it was better to avoid problems
he was desperate to play his first game in the @entity41 , but he has plenty of games ahead of him here
" his pre-season was very unusual , not just physically , but mentally too
he was waiting for a long time ( before signing ) and i think this is a problem
" @entity12 stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the fourth minute when @entity76 's shot deflected in off @entity77 , but the @entity5 defender equalized just before 20 minutes after @entity2 's shot was only blocked by keeper @entity80
@entity2 put @entity5 ahead just after half an hour from the penalty spot , as @entity82 was ruled to have deliberately handled his free - kick inside the area , and he joined @entity5 's former @entity86 star @entity85 on 207 goals
@entity42 , who last season inspired @entity89 to the @entity9 quarterfinals despite the club 's financial problems , made it 3 - 1 in the 57th minute
@entity97 by @entity2 's quick free - kick , the 21 - year - old @entity94 international made no mistake with his fifth goal in six games
@entity12 had @entity82 sent off five minutes from time when the midfielder was booked a second time , and @entity2 crowned his night with a cheeky backheel to score from @entity106 's low cross
promoted @entity46 stayed fourth after drawing 0 - 0 at @entity107 , while there was a mid-table stalemate between @entity110 and @entity111
@entity112 ended a run of three @entity27 defeats and a @entity116 loss to @entity117 by beating bottom club @entity118 3 - 1 , as @entity119 scored twice
meanwhile , sunday 's @entity121 derby between @entity122 and @entity48 was abandoned due to crowd trouble at the end of the match between two of @entity128 's leading teams
@entity48 had led 2 - 1 through two goals by @entity131 veteran @entity130 when his @entity133 teammate @entity132 was sent off in time added on , and fans then invaded the pitch
" how the proceedings will continue will be announced later by the @entity128 , " the @entity48 website reported
in @entity140 , @entity139 went top on goal difference after beating @entity142 2 - 0 in the capital derby for a fourth successive win
second - half goals from @entity146 and @entity147 put the @entity148 marginally above @entity149 -- also with a 100 % record after winning 2 - 1 at @entity151
@entity153 defender @entity152 put @entity155 's team ahead in the sixth minute and @entity157 striker @entity156 doubled the lead on 53 before @entity160 's late consolation for 11th - placed @entity151
however , the @entity140 striker had earlier missed the first penalty of his professional career , saved by keeper @entity164 , as @entity149 beat @entity151 at the @entity165 for the first time since 1986
third - placed @entity167 crushed @entity168 7 - 0 as @entity170 striker @entity169 marked his long - awaited return from a serious knee injury with two goals
it left @entity175 fourth on goal difference after a 2 - 0 win at @entity178 , while fifth - placed defending champion @entity179 also ha 10 points after coming from behind to beat @entity182 2 - 1 thanks to goals from summer signings @entity186 and @entity187
the battle for supremacy between @entity191 's two big - spending clubs ended in a 1 - 1 draw as @entity193 came from behind to deny defending champion @entity194
@entity196 put the home side ahead but @entity202 -- like his @entity199 striking counterpart , a marquee signing of intent -- leveled to keep @entity193 top of the table , two points ahead of second - placed @entity194 .
