-- violent attacks , the chanting of @entity4 's name and anti-semitic abuse -- not dark memories of the 1930s but four days in the life of @entity9 club @entity8
it has been an annus horribilis in football 's fight against discrimination with @entity14 and @entity15 notably dragged through the mud , but sunday 's game against @entity18 at @entity21 ' @entity20 stadium -- as fans made @entity23 salutes -- gave the impression @entity26 football had reached a new low
as well as the salutes , there were also accusations of anti-semitic abuse , including hissing to mimic the sound of gas chambers , a reminder of the deaths of six million @entity34 during the @entity35
@entity20 is situated in north @entity36 , which is home to a large @entity34 community , an association that has led some of @entity8 's fans identifying themselves as " @entity41 " , a term which at different times throughout history has been used by @entity34 and also to abuse them
some @entity21 supporters have attempted to " reclaim " the word , using terms like " @entity48 " and calling themselves the " @entity49 "
however , critics argue the word 's use by @entity8 fans creates an opportunity for a dangerous undercurrent of @entity56 in @entity58 soccer to be exploited
just days before sunday 's game , @entity60 fans had chanted " @entity8 " in a @entity63 match against @entity21 in @entity64
" there is a hardcore of racist and anti-semitic fans in @entity75 football who really do n't seem to have any regard for common sense or decency , " @entity65 , the chairman of the association of black lawyers , a group which has threatened to take legal against @entity21 fans who continue to use the term " @entity41 " , told @entity0
" despite the fact there are people in hospital having been abused on wednesday night in @entity64 , they seem to add to that distress with these comments
we 're in discussions with @entity36 's @entity89
" i understand the @entity90 have already reported it , which they should do with such incidents , " added @entity65
" there has to be zero tolerance -- if these people can be identified they should be prosecuted and banned from football
" " as bad as the @entity35 " that has already happened to one @entity18 fan
" @entity8 have confirmed that five supporters were arrested during sunday 's match at @entity20 outside of the stadium for unrelated incidents and two more were cautioned for racially aggravated gesturing inside the ground. , " said a @entity18 statement
" one of those fans has since been identified as a season ticket holder and has been sent a letter containing a banning order from the club
any other individuals identified can expect a similar swift and robust response
" given what had happened on thursday in @entity64 , third - tier @entity118 manager @entity117 will probably wished he had chosen his words more carefully in describing his team 's performance on saturday " as bad as the @entity35 "
" anti-semitism has no place in football or society in general , " said the @entity122 , which works to promote and defend the religious and civil liberties of @entity126
" for football fans to use @entity35 imagery and chants glorifying @entity4 is grossly offensive to the @entity34 community and is a stain upon the character of @entity75 football
" @entity65 , who reported the racism allegations recently made by @entity14 against @entity139 to the police before the investigation was dropped and the referee was later cleared by the @entity90 , suggests the use of the term " @entity41 " encourages an extreme reaction from a vocal minority
" what you have to understand is that if only one person is offended it 's one too many. , " said @entity65
" all these chants , intentional or unintentional , have to stop
if this happened in athletics or rugby it would n't be tolerated , why should it be tolerated in football ? " " we 'll sing what we want " but not all @entity21 fans want to see the back of the word " @entity41 " and recent matches have seen the team 's followers chant " we 'll sing what we want " in direct response to @entity65 's threat
" i 've never had any problem using it , " said @entity21 supporter @entity168 , who is not @entity34
" it 's a word @entity21 fans regularly shout to each other
if i 'm wearing a @entity21 shirt in the street , it 's quite common for another passing @entity21 fan to shout ' @entity48 '
" i was probably about seven or eight and it was the first @entity21 game i went to
we used to have a drummer at @entity20 and the song used to go ' boom , boom , boon , boom - boom - boom , @entity41 ! ' " i looked around and saw pretty much every @entity21 fans clapping along and joining in with it ... it 's something we 've really made our own , it 's a collective term for our fans now
it 's an accepted word for @entity21 fans in the modern age
" @entity168 rejected the idea that @entity21 fans ' use of the term encourages anti-semitism , saying that particular argument removes any responsibility from the abusers
" it 's a pretty weak argument , " he said
" it 's been compared to another argument which suggests if girls wear short skirts they 're inviting bad things to happen to them
" @entity21 fan goes to the game thinking ' if i chant the word yid i 'm going to incite some racial hatred '
no one goes to the game thinking they are going to get some racial abuse
" but @entity75 comedian and author @entity212 disagrees
" the idea that @entity21 fans are reclaiming the y - word and are entitled to because so many of them are @entity34 is simply not true , " said @entity212 , who is @entity34 and a @entity14 fan , recently writing in the @entity215
" there are only 250,000 @entity34 in @entity75 as a whole and i 'd say about three or four per cent of @entity8 's crowd is @entity34
" that means well over 90 % of those chanting ' @entity49 ' are not actually @entity34 and that is just one of several reasons why it can not be right
" poisonous atmosphere as the @entity90 investigate what happened on sunday , academic @entity229 called for @entity232 's governing body to deliver a reasoned response
" the authorities need to respond by empowering the majority of those fans who are n't abusing other supporters , " said @entity234 , who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice
" if the lessons of the past are anything to go by , solutions reside in working with fans ' grassroots organizations to respond constructively to any criminal action that occurred
the key message is that an indiscriminate response is counterproductive
" do n't forget there is already sufficient legislation to deal with anti-semitic or racist chanting at football grounds " where this has happened then clearly it must be condemned and if the evidence exists for criminal sanctions to follow
" but a knee - jerk response can escalate the problem and it is important to keep what happened in perspective
" without attempting to excuse the actions of @entity18 's fans , @entity234 explained how a unique set of circumstances had combined to create sunday 's poisonous atmosphere
" those chants -- inexcusable as they are -- followed the news about what happened in @entity64 and what the @entity273 has been saying about the illegitimacy of @entity21 fans ' expression of their identity
" in 12 months i doubt if and when this fixture is played again that those chants would be repeated
" meanwhile , @entity65 wants football 's @entity58 governing body @entity282 to use its regulations to empower referees in future to prevent a repeat of the abusive incidents that recently occurred in @entity289 involving @entity232 's under - 21 team as well as @entity64 and north @entity36
" we 'd like to see a proactive stance on this , a vigorous approach , prosecute where possible , ban people from grounds and if incidents like that do happen , call a halt to the game
" there is a @entity282 rule which is never used where a referee can call off the game
that 's the sort of initiative which has to happen
" do you want to watch a football game or do you want to listen to this abuse ? "
