-- on june 30 , in the streets of @entity3 , i watched crowds stream down @entity6 street , one of the city 's main roads , chanting : " the @entity10 ! the people ! are one hand ! " officers posed for photos , waved @entity16 flags from pickup trucks jammed with @entity19 protesters and roared up @entity3 's wide boulevards on their motorcycles to cheers and waves
some in the crowd refused to join in , but this was , just the same , a sight i never imagined i would see , after over two years of sit - ins in which the police had been the protesters ' clear enemy
from the beginnins of @entity16 's uprising , in january 2011 , the overhaul of @entity16 's police forces , known for torturing detainees and brutally dispersing peaceful demonstrations , was a key demand of protesters
but not even the most rudimentary reforms have taken place since then
neither the @entity42 of @entity43 , which governed @entity16 during the transitional period , nor @entity45 during his year as president made any attempt whatsoever to take on police brutality and torture
the army itself was responsible for similar abuses during the transitional period
police officers have yet to be held accountable for excessive use of force over the past two and a half years
police killed at least 846 protestors in january 2011
but of 38 officers sent to trial for the killings , only two have been sentenced and jailed
now @entity16 has once again descended into spasms of violence
over the last two weeks in @entity3 and @entity66 , armed @entity65 supporters have fired automatic weapons on @entity19 protesters who are armed with rocks and @entity70 while police and army have stood and watched
neighborhood protection groups in both cities have engaged in hours - long combat with armed @entity45 supporters who marched through their communities damaging property and harassing passersby
in the grim corridors of @entity66 's public hospitals and the dusty courtyard of the city 's morgue , grieving relatives and friends described watching army and police officers use deadly force against demonstrators in front of the @entity93 headquarters , where the deposed president was allegedly being held
fifty - one people were killed on the morning of july 8
the pattern that emerges is this : in every instance , police and sometimes army troops have acted in a partisan fashion , using what appears to be largely unwarranted force against mostly unarmed @entity65 supporters at sit - ins , yet doing little to intervene when opposing camps clash violently
a group of outraged women in @entity109 , a leafy island in the @entity110 , told me how during a 10 - hour street battle they repeatedly called police , the army -- anyone who could possibly offer protection -- while their sons and husbands fought @entity65 supporters with paving stones and @entity121
@entity122 , a 27 - year - old wearing jeans still spattered with blood from the night before , told me : " @entity125 came in aggressively , hitting people , cars and shops so that no one would get in their way
" they entered the neighborhood around 8 p.m. , he said , but police only arrived at midnight , stayed for about half an hour , then retreated , though the fighting continued until 6 a.m. from his @entity3 hospital bed , @entity135 , an independent video journalist , showed me footage in which he followed a high - ranking police general around the @entity140 train station as machine gun fire from @entity65 supporters echoed outside , asking the commander to do his job , to call in reinforcements
the general waved him aside while talking frantically on his mobile phone
the police appeared to arrive , then left a few minutes later
@entity135 's video footage ends when @entity65 supporters shoot him in the leg
on the morning of july 8 i passed through @entity150 where the organizers of @entity152 , who mobilized the initial protests on june 30 that brought millions into the streets , had called for a sit - in
i saw police officers handing out juice boxes and snacks to passersby alongside a vehicle emblazoned with the slogan , " @entity10
" i arrived at the @entity163 a short while later to find the sting of tear gas still in the air and the sound of sporadic gunfire
witnesses said that the army and @entity173 ( riot police ) officers had opened fire on the crowd after trying to break up their sit - in
while some of the protesters had guns , witnesses said , and three security officers died , the protesters for the most part responded with rocks and @entity186 cocktails
with 51 protesters dead and more than 400 injured , it was among the deadliest days of security force violence since @entity190 stepped down
calls to hold the @entity65 to account are at a fever pitch , and the military - installed government has issued arrest warrants for more than 300 @entity65 members
but there is little appetite among @entity16 's transitional authorities for the essential task of investigating the police or the military for deaths they have caused , or for the badly needed reforms in the security sector
as foreign governments wring their hands , private citizens across the political spectrum are arming up , to dangerous effect , and people are dying again in @entity16 's streets and squares
those governments need to use what leverage they have to push urgently for credible impartial investigations and accountability for crimes by all parties , police and army as well as protesters
such steps are the only way to pull @entity16 back from the brink , and to rebuild trust in its battered and discredited state institutions
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .
