@entity0 -- the much anticipated trial of former @entity4 interior minister @entity3 has been postponed until august 3 -- the same day @entity4 's ousted president is scheduled to stand trial
@entity3 and former @entity4 president @entity7 face charges of killing pro-democracy protesters during the revolution that started six months ago
@entity3 's trial at a @entity0 court was expected to be carried live on state television monday
this is second time the trial was postponed amid frustrations among protesters in @entity18 who demand speedy trials and swift judgments for detained officials from @entity7 's regime
judge @entity23 announced the postponement to a court room packed with people -- many of whom had already learned about the decision on @entity4 @entity30
" the decision was leaked by the lawyers before the hearing and broadcast before the defendants and judge even entered the court -- which was a big mistake , " said @entity31 , a judicial consultant with the @entity32
@entity3 appeared with a blue uniform because he had been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges
six of his former assistants , who were also set to stand trial for allegedly killing protesters , appeared in white suits
the authorities asked all journalists to leave the court except for @entity4 tv staff in charge of broadcasting the trial
" do they expect us to believe that @entity7 will appear with @entity3 in two weeks at a court when he has been in @entity58 for six months ? " said @entity52 , an activist and son of presidential candidate @entity54
the 83 - year - old ex-ruler fell into a coma earlier this month , @entity7 lawyer @entity59 told @entity1
he later regained consciousness , said @entity63 , the head of the @entity58 facility where @entity7 was recuperating
@entity31 said @entity7 and @entity3 are expected to be tried in the coastal city due to security issues
more than 800 protesters were killed during the @entity4 revolution when pro-democracy protests forced @entity7 to step down on february 11
@entity1 's @entity70 contributed to this report .
