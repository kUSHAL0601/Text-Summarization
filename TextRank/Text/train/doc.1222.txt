-- @entity6 , the @entity2 prototype @entity3 built in his @entity5 dorm room one october night in 2003 , is now up for auction on @entity8 -- or at least the url is
the domain once housed a @entity5 version of @entity12 , which placed photos of various university women next to one another and asked visitors to select which one was more attractive
@entity18 reportedly attracted 450 visitors and generated 22,000 page views in its first evening ; it was pulled down by @entity5 several days later
now , the site attracts approximately 600 visitors per month , the auctioneer claims , though since the release of the movie " @entity27 , " which mentions @entity18 , the site has received more than 1,000 hits per day
the domain is currently listed for $ 8,000 and , though it appears to be legit , has attracted few bids
that 's not terribly surprising , given the kind of hassle any business built on the site is likely to attract from @entity2 's lawyers
tell us : what would you host at @entity6 ? Â© 2013 @entity0
