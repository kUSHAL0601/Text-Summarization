-- in the past 10 years we 've seen cell phones transform into electronic @entity4 army knives with a wild variety of functions and features
they are replacing the watch , the camera , the standalone gps , the alarm clock , and many other tools
but what will the smartphones of the future look like ? here 's what we envision ... in five years , the @entity18 are over and @entity19 emerges victorious
the company has trademarks of many design features , including many types of curves
as a result , competing smartphone manufacturers resort to triangular or angular forms
tech : how smartphones make us superhuman fast forward 15 years
with @entity33 's pioneering work , smartphones evolve into wearable devices with augmented reality
these smartglasses provide a constant stream of content and advertisement directly into the user 's field of vision
after the fad of wearable phone glasses , companies go mad with miniaturization in 25 years
technology allows for extreme miniaturization and phones become single use , disposable devices
50 years later , wearable phones make a comeback in the form of wristbands
the wristphone , as it is commonly known , is customized to fit each user 's arm perfectly
it includes state - of - the - art voice - command features as well as holographic component that let you chat with your friends as though they are right next to you
tech : diaries of smartphone addicts technology takes a huge leap in 75 years
@entity68 can be installed directly in the user 's brain
@entity19 , along with a handful of companies , makes these chips
thoughts connect instantly when people dial to " call " each other
but there 's one downside : " @entity82 " can occasionally control the user 's behavior because of an impossible - to - resolve glitch
if a user encounters this glitch -- a 1 in a billion probability -- every piece of data that his brain delivers is uploaded to companies ' servers so that they may " serve customers better
" in the year 2112 , civilization crumbles because of climate change and dramatic loss of natural resources
communication comes full circle as dialogue between humans revert to individuals throwing rocks at each other
but rest assured -- people still laugh out loud
tech : in defense of a stupidphone the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity108 and @entity109 .
