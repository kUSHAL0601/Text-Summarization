@entity0 -- it may seem counterintuitive , but federal aviation officials said wednesday they will make the skies safer for air travelers not by punishing @entity7 employees who report making mistakes , but by protecting them from punishment
@entity7 officials announced that as part of a new " safety culture " at the agency , they would fully embrace nonpunitive reporting systems , in an effort to generate information that could expose bigger dangers
" make no mistake about it : we do n't condone ( errors ) , " said @entity20 , the @entity7 's chief operating officer
" however , we presume the good intent of our controllers and are more interested in the free flow of information than we are in punishing for errors
" the @entity7 took a half - step in that direction in 2008 , creating a nonpunitive reporting system for air traffic controllers
on wednesday , the @entity7 said it was expanding the program to employees who maintain radar installations and other systems
and it changed longstanding @entity7 nomenclature
from now on , " operational errors " -- for instance , when an air traffic controller brings two planes too close together -- will be known as " operational incidents
" @entity43 experiments with lighter screening of elderly the change will reduce the " stigma " associated with errors , @entity20 said , thereby increasing information and allowing the agency to make life - saving changes
the new system , paradoxically , will mean an increase in reported " operational incidents " in the short term , officials said
incident reports " will certainly go up in the next few years with all of our additional reporting systems , " @entity20 said
but risk will be going down , he said
safety advocates have long touted the benefits of nonpunitive systems , and some welcomed the @entity7 's announcement
" it 's a good , positive step , " said @entity66 , a former @entity7 chief of staff who now heads a consulting business in @entity0
" mistakes happen and we need to learn from our mistakes
" @entity66 said the @entity7 was correct in expanding the system to include the agency 's technicians
" the technicians are the forgotten part of aviation , " he said
" they 're the ones out there 24/7 keeping things working
they do n't get the attention the air traffic controllers do
" in announcing the new reporting systems , the @entity7 cast itself as a victim of its success
@entity7 officials said they used to be able to measure risk by counting accidents
the fewer crashes , the better the agency was doing
but with the commercial aviation accident rate at historically low levels -- there has not been a fatal commercial crash in three years -- the agency needs to look at other data to identify risky behaviors and incidents , and to address them
one measure has been " operational errors , " or instances in which controllers deviate from established protocols
currently , 99.9 percent of operations occur completely according to procedures , @entity20 said
@entity20 said the @entity7 is activating sophisticated software that will monitor operations and will bring more errors , or incidents , to light
the @entity7 said the voluntary reporting system for controllers has provided nearly 10 times the data during the past three years compared to the traditional reporting system
it also led to the @entity7 's issuing scores of corrective actions , making aviation safer in the @entity123
it also helped the agency to identify the top hazards , and to focus on those hazards
officials said there are safeguards to protect employees from abusing the nonpunitive reporting system
after a mistake is reported , the incident is reviewed by a three - person panel , with representatives from management , the union and an oversight organization
the panel can ask for additional information , launch an investigation or take other action as appropriate
if an error was intentional , the @entity7 can take action , officials said .
