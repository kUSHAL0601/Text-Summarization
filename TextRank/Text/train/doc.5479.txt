-- the father of @entity4 , the teenager whom the @entity5 tried to kill , has been given a job in a @entity2 consulate in @entity8 , @entity9 , where she is recovering from gunshot wounds to her head and neck , @entity2 officials said wednesday
@entity15 has been appointed education attache and will function as head of the consulate 's education section for three years , the @entity2 government said
his job could be extended two additional years
at the time of his daughter 's shooting , @entity15 ran a school in @entity2 's conservative @entity25 that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the @entity5
the @entity5 forbid girls in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them
@entity4 was shot by gunmen last fall for her crusade about girls going to school
she had blogged fearlessly about girls ' education and accused the @entity5 of thriving on ignorance
her father 's employment fulfills a pledge by @entity2 president @entity43 , who visited @entity4 in december and assured her father that the government would meet " all expenses of @entity4 's treatment and all the needs of the family while in @entity51 , " a government statement said wednesday
" in light of that , the present appointment has been made , " the statement said
on october 9 , @entity4 was on a school van in @entity25 when @entity5 gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them who was @entity4
@entity4 was then shot , as were two other girls who survived the attack
" we do not tolerate people like @entity4 speaking against us , " a @entity5 spokesman said after the shooting
he vowed to come after her if she managed to live
islamic militants also threatened to kill journalists covering her story
since her shooting , @entity4 has become an international figure
she was selected as runner - up for @entity75 's @entity74 for 2012
@entity0 and @entity75 are owned by @entity76 @entity4 arrived at @entity8 on october 16
a bullet that hit her left brow did n't penetrate the skull but traveled the side of her head under the skin and into her neck , the hospital said
the shock wave shattered the thinnest bone of her skull , and fragments entered her brain , the hospital said
the teen had been in critical condition , but doctors removed the bullet and she has no major brain or nerve damage
physicians said she will need reconstructive surgery
@entity4 is walking , writing and reading again
the @entity102 militants behind the @entity5 continue to repress women in northwest @entity2
last month , @entity4 asked a graduate school not to name its institution after her
girls were afraid that attending the @entity108 in the @entity5 - dominated @entity25 would attract the attention of fighters such as the ones who shot @entity4 and the two other girls , said @entity114 , a top official in the @entity25
the @entity115 briefly changed its name to recognize @entity4 's brave campaign for girls ' education in @entity2
several students told @entity114 that they respect @entity4 but were concerned about their safety , he said
@entity114 told @entity0 that @entity4 called him last month from her hospital room in @entity9 and asked the school to remove her name
but she wished for people to continue to fight for girls to go to school , he said
" i was so impressed that despite having threats against her life , she was talking about girls ' education in the region and against militants , " @entity114 said
@entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .
