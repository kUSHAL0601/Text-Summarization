to @entity1 , @entity0 is fraught with voter fraud and the state is doing nothing about it
so the former @entity6 veteran has taken matters into his own hands and vows , as he sees it , to save the system from eroding honest elections
@entity1 launched the @entity13 more than three years ago , leading a band of volunteers in scouring public records and knocking on doors to root out irregularities in voter rolls
it 's tedious work , and @entity1 has generated mixed results as well as a measure of controversy
some call his efforts " sloppy " and question whether he 's addressing a serious shortcoming or whether he 's become -- intended or not -- illustrative of the tough @entity28 - driven voter identification law that critics contend intimidates and disenfranchises minority voters
moreover , this is all playing out amid hardening partisan divisions nationwide and legal and legislative battles as the nation hurtles toward a midterm vote with the @entity39 at stake and a presidential ballot in 2016
a man with a mission at the vip headquarters in a commercial office park in @entity46 that resembled many low - budget start - ups , complete with a dry - ink erase board , folding tables with chairs and a big wood , scuffed desk , @entity1 proudly walked through the inter workings of his organization that includes a few dozen volunteers spread around the state
bald and 56 , he seems at least a decade younger than his age
his enthusiasm screams through his rabidly opinionated professions about how voting should work
he thinks the mentally ill should be barred from voting , felons should be restored their voting right after they serve their sentence and probation , homeless people should be allowed to vote but only if they remain at the address they put on their voter registration form , and those who do n't know the issues should stay home
@entity1 co-opted his tactics from @entity73 , a well - funded yet controversial conservative group in @entity74 that prioritizes citizen enforcement of the voter laws
framed by a 12 - foot long map of @entity0 divided into counties and congressional districts on loan from a @entity28 member of the state legislature , @entity1 also talks about the need for a strict photo id law and that fraudulent voting is rampant in elections
and he 's doing everything he can to ensure that his vision of the election system is carried out
to address their concerns , @entity1 and his volunteers plow through public data -- tax records , voting records , jury records , census data and death records - scouring for suspicion and inconsistencies
he compares tax data with @entity101 records , voting records in @entity0 with voting records in @entity104 , jury data with voter rolls
he calls it data mining
all this information is then inserted into an algorithm , creating spreadsheets upon spreadsheets for volunteers to investigate
when red flags are raised , they might turn it over to the @entity117 or they might check it out themselves
looking in a liberal bastion in @entity122 , which includes the western city of @entity124 , a liberal bastion in a relatively conservative state , @entity1 's forces teamed with a local tea party group to analyze data
when five or more registered voters are listed at one address , a red flag goes up
then they put on their shoes and pound the pavement
" we would actually knock on the door at that address , " @entity1 said
his volunteers would check to see who lived there and if it matched the records
the response ? " some would slam the door in our face , " @entity1 said , but added that others would answer their questions
if doubts persisted after confronting residences , they 'd move to @entity150
@entity151 would address a letter to the person in question
if the letter came back with " return to sender , " that letter became evidence to submit to the @entity117
@entity1 said a worst - case scenario would involve someone voting fraudulently or , at the very least , they need to be removed from the voter rolls for not living at the address listed
@entity1 took 180 cases to the @entity122 elections board and a little more than half the names were stricken from the voter rolls
@entity168 , a volunteer with the @entity13 and head of the @entity170 who participated in the door - to - door checks , said the reason they are checking the voter rolls name by name is simple : " we 're doing it because the ( political ) parties are n't
" @entity182 group in @entity0 might give up on national races vigilante or vindicator ? @entity1 and his group are an aggravating nuisance whose tactics do more damage than good , according to fellow good governance groups with opposing ideological views
@entity192 , president of @entity193 , said vip targets minority and @entity196 leaning districts , leading to voter disenfranchisement and voter intimidation
she said that of the 80 precincts in @entity122 , all of @entity13 's challenges came from 11 precincts , most of them low income or minority -- communities that are more likely to have more people living under one roof
" it has an intimidation effect , " @entity192 said , detailing the story of one @entity213 woman who said she did n't feel comfortable when people showed up at her door and wanted to know where her sons lived
2014 midterms : what 's at stake @entity192 also said he has effectively removed homeless people from the voter rolls for not being at a fixed address
@entity1 shot back , saying @entity192 needs to " cut the emotion and deal with the facts
" " our laws are so lenient in favor of the voter that any person can claim they 're homeless and vote from anywhere , " @entity1 said
@entity0 's tamp down @entity0 's election record is good
the @entity236 ' election initiative named it one of the top - performing states in 2012
the organization cited increased voter registration , few problems with provisional ballots and minimal wait times at polls
of the 88 % of eligible voters are registered to vote , more than 65 % voted in 2012 , according to the @entity245 and confirmed by the state
that turnout is similar to 2008 and both elections saw @entity213 vote at a higher rate than whites , according to @entity251 , an election watchdog group
in addition , cases of fraud are negligible
the state 's board of elections says fraud is possible but the state does n't keep track
elections board spokesman @entity262 said in the most recent statewide elections on may 6 , one case of fraud was referred to the the local district attorney 's office and he anticipates " at least three other " cases will be investigated by the board of elections
but still , the state enacted one of the most stringent voter id laws in the country , requiring one of a limited number of forms of identification at the poll starting in 2016
the law also gives voter vigilantes more power , enabling citizens to challenge another person 's vote anywhere in the state
like laws of its kind that have been passed and challenged elsewhere , including in @entity286 and @entity287 where the courts struck down the laws , @entity0 's law is being challenged for disenfranchising voters
@entity291 , political science professor at @entity292 , said the law discourages people to vote , adding that the state that voted for @entity295 @entity294 in 2008 and @entity28 @entity296 in 2012 has taken a step backward
5 takeaways from @entity0 's primary election " they 've gone the wrong direction in the importance of protecting the vote , " @entity291 said
" they 've erred on the side of making sure no ineligible person would vote
" while @entity1 aggressively advocated for the law , he pushed for a version that went even further
and thinks the state is n't doing enough to enforce the laws and that high voter participation is an indicator that fraud is rampant
mixed results after three years of work and countless volunteer hours , @entity1 has no cases of fraud to show
he cites , however , that the board of elections has made five " referrals " of prosecution to local district attorneys
he blames the @entity28 - led board of elections and the inherent difficulty in the system to confirm fraud in the election system
" we thought with two republicans in charge they would work with us , " @entity1 said
" even when we do the right thing , the authorities do n't really care
" his group also challenged 130 people who are on the voter rolls who got out of jury duty for saying they were n't a citizen
but the board of elections rejected their challenge
despite falling short on the fraud front , the group has had some impact , including pushing the state to conduct more thorough list maintenance
he has played a role in removing about 30,000 people from the voter rolls , most of whom had died , which was confirmed by a state - led audit
that 's in addition to an ongoing state issued review of another 155,000 people who are also registered in other states
and to the chagrin of some and the delight of others , they 've helped to raise the issue to a whole new level in the state
" they 've caused bureaucratic wheels to turn , " @entity291 said
@entity262 said they welcome the work @entity1 - and all good governance groups - are doing
the state is looking into some of @entity151 's findings , including 149 instancevs of people with the same name and birthday who voted in @entity0 and in @entity104
but @entity383 , executive director of @entity251 , a voter protection organization , said @entity1 's group does " sloppy " research and submits piles of claims to the board of elections to sift through with no substantial outcome
" they have the appearance of being a research group but they operate like a witch hunt group , " @entity383 said
" that 's not useful
" @entity1 dismisses his critics and states the overall goal
" we want to figure out how people are voting multiple times
that 's the whole ball game , " he said
