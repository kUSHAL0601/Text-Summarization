-- the government of @entity3 , @entity4 , will provide $ 1 billion in funding for recovery and reconstruction after the province 's devastating floods , premier @entity1 said monday
" we are going to do -- please listen to my words -- whatever it takes to get everyone back to a place where they can continue to live their lives , " @entity10 said
more than 100,000 @entity3 have been affected by the floods , which began last week after heavy mountain rains swelled rivers flowing to the east
tens of thousands of people were evacuated in @entity24 , @entity25 and elsewhere , along with the entire town of @entity27 , where three people died in the floods
another @entity4 city braces for flooding , evacuates 10,000 " yesterday , i saw families in @entity24 emptying their entire basements out ; wet furniture was strewn across front lawns , " @entity10 said in a statement
" and at the evacuation site in @entity37 , i met families who feel they 've lost everything and do n't know when they 'll get home to @entity27
" the $ 1 billion will be used to help rebuilding efforts and support displaced families
they will receive pre-loaded debit cards of $ 1,250 per adult and $ 500 per child to help with housing needs and day - to - day purchases , @entity10 said
waters have been receding in some parts of the province while others are now dealing with flooding
some 65,000 residents in @entity24 got the all - clear to return home
@entity24 , where the @entity56 and @entity57 converge , was especially hard - hit , but power was restored to a large portion of it , and the city expected to reopen nearly all of downtown by tuesday , mayor @entity61 said
in @entity3 , misery rises along with floodwaters in @entity27 , about 40 miles south of @entity24 , the flooding has now stopped , but some water is simply not receding , said constable @entity69 of the @entity70
that makes it difficult to assess the extent of the damage in @entity27 , though it 's safe to say the town is in a " critical situation " with extensive damage , said @entity79 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 government
the @entity81 flowing through @entity25 , in southeastern @entity3 , crested monday but was still overflowing its banks , @entity69 said
@entity25 was able to stave off some damage because it saw the extent of flooding to the west days before it reached the city and was able to prepare , she said
" i think it made a big difference , " @entity69 said
the city said monday it is starting to return residents to their homes
new flooding was occurring monday in @entity92 , known as the dinosaur capital of the world for the dinosaur bones and fossils found there , and at the @entity98 , east of @entity24 , @entity69 said .
