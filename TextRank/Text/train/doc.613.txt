@entity0 -- there are few people in the world lucky enough to form a close relationship with a @entity7 painting
@entity9 - based conservator @entity8 is one : she spent hundreds of hours lovingly restoring " @entity10 , " @entity7 's newly rediscovered painting of @entity12
and , says @entity8 , when she finally had to say goodbye to the painting it was like enduring a painful break - up
" i 'm quite serious , " she said
" it was a very intense picture and i felt a whole slipstream of artistry and genius and some sort of otherworldliness that i 'll never experience again , " she said
she describes suffering separation anxiety and depression over losing the painting , and with it her connection to the enigmatic painter who was its author
for art historians , the lengthy and emotional process of conserving a great masterwork is both a privilege and an overwhelming responsibility
" people say , ' how can you touch it , it 's so scary , ' " said @entity8 , who is @entity34 and @entity35 for the @entity36 at the @entity37 of the @entity38 , @entity39
" i was n't frightened of it in those ways -- that it 's one of 16 paintings , it 's worth x amount of dollars -- because i would have been paralyzed , i would n't be able to work like that , " she continued
of course , when @entity8 started work in 2005 , she did n't know she was dealing with the first @entity7 painting to be discovered in over 100 years , worth , according to some estimates , around $ 200 million
the painting , now authenticated , revealed its identity little - by - little during the conservation treatment
@entity8 started the process using solvents to clean off some of the murky varnish and over-paint that was concealing the painting 's true identity
within just a few hours during her first session with it , she was able to see the work much more clearly
" it 's very mysterious , the things that happen to paintings , " she said of the over-paint job
" people forget or they begin to doubt the original opinion of the person who originally said it was by @entity7 and particularly if it 's been badly repaired
they might not understand what 's underneath -- it happens to pictures all the time , " she continued
the next step was to take the cracked painting apart and piece it back together again , a procedure that took about a year
" it is quite a delicate process , " said @entity8
" it has to be very precise
" then , she had to make re-touches to the badly damaged areas , refining @entity12 's eyes and lips
it was a particularly difficult and lengthy part of the process because , she said , she had " to make the decision of what to touch and what to leave alone
" " i wanted ( to be sure ) that none of my restorations had impinged on the original , that i had not done too much , because old pictures have to look old -- if you take out every crack , every spot , every anomaly , they can easily look like a reproduction , " she said
@entity101 is the director of conservation at the @entity103 in @entity0 and responsible for the conservation of @entity7 's " @entity105 , " which is in the gallery 's collection
this treatment involved cleaning off the layers of yellow , foggy varnish , applied in a previous restoration process , " to allow the picture to saturate properly so you can see the full total range of thematic relationships that are there in the painting , " said @entity101
the process of cleaning this particular painting took 18 months , he said
it is is now on view at the @entity103 as part of the exhibition " @entity7 : painter at the @entity125 " along with " @entity10
" he agrees that the job of conserving such a masterpiece is an honor few are lucky to have
" it 's wonderful to see the picture in a different light and conditions and over the course of a treatment , you do get very close to a picture , " he said
as to whether he felt close to @entity7 while working on the painting , he said : " i suppose you do , in as far as anyone can get close to @entity7
" " there 's a certain mystery at the core of him i think , but it 's true , you 're in very close contact for a long time and it 's a very privileged role , " he concluded .
