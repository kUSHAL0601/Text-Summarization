-- shortly after @entity3 became a state in 1959 , more than 90 % of registered voters there participated in elections
the state , which now has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country , has a vibrant history of civic participation
it could be that way again
here are six recommendations for how @entity3 could boost its voter turnout rate , taking into account both national and state policies , as well as individual efforts
have a look and please offer suggestions of your own in the comments section below
( and a special thanks to those of you who sent in ideas on the @entity25 )
ask five friends to vote ( seriously ) : on a recent trip to @entity3 , i met people who did n't know the presidential election would be in november ( it 's the 6th , in case that 's you )
others do n't identify as voters
that can all change if you invite someone to participate
better , ask five people , or post this on five friends ' @entity42 walls
it 's shocking how far these personal invitations can go
pressure candidates to debate in public : by far the most eccentric person i met in @entity3 was @entity50 , a self - described homeless candidate for a @entity53 @entity52 seat
he is seen by many as a joke
his platform , for example , is anti-tax and pro-smoking ( in bars , if the owner wants to allow it )
no matter how wacky his ideas are , or how unlikely his chances , his opponent , @entity63 , a rising star in the @entity65 party , should debate him
the @entity63 campaign said no media organizations have approached the @entity65 candidate about having a debate with @entity50
" you can stand on a street corner and have a debate but we have n't seen any media outlets come forward " requesting one , said spokesman @entity71
it likely is too late for that to happen now , with the election less than two weeks away
but a debate would have been the democratic thing to do -- even if it had to be held on @entity83
start the move toward online elections : young people do n't vote
it 's especially true in @entity3 , where less than half of the eligible population casts ballots -- and , in 2008 , less than a third of young people voted
there 's little if any voting culture in the state
that could change if elections came to younger people in the places they hang out : the beach ( unlikely ) , or the @entity102
at the very least , voter registration should move online
it 's unclear to what degree this would boost turnout , said @entity108 , from the @entity109 , but it 's more efficient and more accurate
ease registration laws : @entity112 had the highest voter turnout rate in 2008 -- with nearly 80 % of eligible residents casting ballots
that 's incredible , but it could be replicated
the state 's laws -- particularly one that allows voters to register at their polling place on @entity122 -- make it easy to vote
@entity3 should at least consider implementing the same
as @entity108 pointed out , what works in one state may not work in another
the cultures and weather in these states are clearly different
but it 's still worth a try
encourage civics education in schools : the best way to create a new generation of voters is to educate them about why civics matter -- how their government affects their day - to - day lives and why it 's best not to check out of the system
that 's some heavy lifting
it 's happening at some @entity3 schools
i went to two -- @entity146 and @entity147 , where @entity148 went to high school -- to see firsthand what a difference a civics - minded education can make
if you talk to kids about politics and voting , they end up creating videos like this one , by @entity161 at @entity147 , which encourages her friends to vote
it makes all the difference
eliminate the @entity165 : can anyone argue the @entity165 makes sense in 2012 ? it should be abolished , creating a ( for once ) truly democratic system where each vote is given the same weight in a presidential election
people in @entity3 feel their votes are less important than those in @entity176 or @entity177 -- or any mainland state
by the time they get to the polls , winners of national elections already have been announced
doing away with the @entity165 would ease this disconnect , making @entity3 's votes matter as much as everyone else 's .
