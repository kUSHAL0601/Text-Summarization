-- the revelation that nearly 800 children may have been buried in an unmarked mass grave at a former @entity2 - run home for unwed mothers in @entity9 is " sickening " and must be investigated , the country 's top @entity2 clergyman says
@entity11 @entity10 has issued a statement urging anyone with information about mass graves to go to the authorities
" @entity19 message is that authentic faith is measured by how we treat children who represent @entity23 , " @entity10 said in the june 5 statement
on june 1 , the @entity24 cited a local historian as saying she believed 796 children who had died between 1925 and 1961 at a home run by the @entity28 had been buried in an unofficial grave beside the home 's old location in @entity32 , @entity33
local children stumbled upon the grave in the 1970s , @entity9 media reported , but the site was never examined afterward
the historian , @entity38 , told @entity39 saturday that she had bought death certificates for the children but she found that there had been no burial records
the revelation has sparked calls for an investigation and renewed questions about the treatment of unmarried mothers and their children by the @entity51 and institutions associated with it
' full bodied inquiry ' the @entity54 said @entity10 had asked the @entity56 archivist to compile information on mother and baby homes in @entity60 several months ago
hundreds of documents had been collated but none so far contained information concerning mass graves , it said
" the archbishop has said he will share this information with any inquiry the government will establish
he expressed the hope that a full bodied inquiry will be set up , examining all aspects of life in the homes and crucially how adoptions were organized
" in an interview with @entity9 's national broadcaster @entity77 , @entity10 said it was important that any commission investigating the graves be given " full judicial powers
" " i also think it 's very important that the commission be clearly separate from church / state or any other organization that was involved in it , " he told @entity77
" i 'm not too sure we can throw the entire blame at the church , i think that would be wrong to do that
there was a society in which there was a sort of collusion between the church and state institutions , " @entity10 said
the archbishop called for a commission to be established to study the social context of the period
government response minister for children and youth affairs @entity102 said in a statement wednesday that " active consideration " was being given to how to address the details that had emerged
" many of the revelations are deeply disturbing and a shocking reminder of a darker past in @entity9 when our children were not cherished as they should have been , " he said
government departments are working together to establish the best course of action , said @entity102
opposition parties @entity116 and @entity118 have urged a comprehensive government inquiry into the matter
archbishop @entity121 , who heads the @entity32 archdiocese , last week welcomed any government move to examine what happened at the home
" it will be a priority for me , in cooperation with the families of the deceased , to seek to obtain a dignified re-interment of the remains of the children in consecrated ground in @entity32 , " he said
' @entity134 ' the @entity32 case is the latest high - profile episode in which the state and @entity51 have been called to account over care of the most vulnerable in @entity9 society
a government report last year into the so - called @entity141 , run by various @entity2 orders , acknowledged that @entity9 's government sent thousands of women and girls to " harsh and physically demanding " workhouses , where they worked and lived without pay , sometimes for years
the laundries operated from 1922 to 1996
while some were sent there by courts , others were unmarried mothers , victims of sexual abuse , orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state , or were mentally or physically disabled
and earlier this year , @entity163 -- whose decades - long search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption in the 1950s was the subject of an @entity168 - nominated film -- launched the @entity169 in hopes of compelling the governments of @entity9 and the @entity172 to open access to adoption records
@entity175 met with @entity176 in february
