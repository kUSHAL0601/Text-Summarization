@entity0 -- how 's this for a bright idea ? police in the southern @entity6 city of @entity7 are responding to headlight infractions with an eye - for - an - eye punishment
if you 're caught using your brights in the city , which shares a border with @entity0 , police will sit you down in the full glare , not of an interrogation room lamp , but of their own full - beams
a post on the @entity7 traffic police 's @entity20 account spells it out
" do you dare to use full - beam headlights anymore ? " the post asks
" from now on , ' uncle cop ' will have you stare at the lights for five minutes if they catch you abusing them
" the stern warning is offset by an animated laughing emoticon
there is also the addition of a more traditional fine of 300 yuan ( $ 49 )
mixed response responses on @entity6 social media ranged from the amused and the approving , to those doubting the safety -- and legality -- of the biblical - style punishment
user @ chas125 said : " i wholeheartedly support this
@entity44 traffic police should adopt the measure , too , " while another user , whose weibo handle suggests a connecttion with the city , was even more enthusiastic
" i 'm hitting ' likes ' with my hands and feet , " @ shenzhenlaocui posted
" full - beam headlights are evil
i suggest they extend the stare time to 30 minutes , splitting it into three time periods , and let people take a 60 - second break in between
" @ @entity56 , however , was a little more phlegmatic
" people hate others who use full - beam headlights too much
i experience that unpleasantness as you do , and it is not safe , " the user said
" but the police ' educate ' the violators beyond laws -- remember laws do n't authorize them to do so -- illegally enforcing the law is more dangerous than using full - beam headlights
" indiscriminately using brights can be hazardous and can dazzle oncoming traffic
given the rapid increase of cars and motor scooters on @entity6 's roads as the country 's economy expands almost unabated , road awareness is an increasing concern
