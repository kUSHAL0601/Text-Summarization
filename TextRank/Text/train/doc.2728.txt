-- this is the @entity2 border city of @entity3 -- seen from above -- where weeks of fighting and aerial bombardment have led to widespread destruction
more than 100,000 refugees have fled to @entity9 amid weeks of intense fighting by @entity12 forces for full control of the city , one of the last in the region to resist falling to @entity17
in the first image above , what was an empty field has turned into a makeshift parking lot -- with hundreds of cars , trucks and buses left abandoned by refugees crossing into @entity9
the second image shows @entity3 's eastern industrial zone , where some of the heaviest fighting has taken place
in the satellite photo from october 15 , more than a dozen buildings have been leveled by coalition airstrikes
the third image shows a compound of buildings captured by @entity17
where once there were trees and buildings , now there is rubble and several massive bomb craters
