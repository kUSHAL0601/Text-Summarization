@entity0 , @entity1 -- millions of people suddenly lost power sunday night around the island of @entity1 -- including all of @entity0
more than 2 million residents of the capital were in the dark late sunday , except for those at hospitals and elsewhere with generators , according to a government spokesman , who was not identified per government policy
the streets of @entity0 lost electricity around 8 p.m. residents elsewhere around the @entity17 nation -- including in @entity18 to the east of @entity0 , and west to @entity20 -- also told @entity2 they did n't have any power , except for a few pockets of light
" @entity1 is without power , " a pro-government blogger known as @entity25 tweeted
power outages are hardly unprecedented in @entity1 , which has an aging power grid
but while brief outages concentrated in a small area are common -- unless , of course , a big storm passes through -- a massive outage on this scale is rare
there was no official explanation for sunday 's outage , according to the government spokesman and state media reports
weather reports for @entity0 indicated partly cloudy conditions on sunday night with temperatures in the high 70s
temperatures were forecast to hover around 90 degrees @entity45 on monday , according to multiple sources .
