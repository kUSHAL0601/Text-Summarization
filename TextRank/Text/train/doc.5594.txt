the mother of an @entity1 on trial in @entity3 denied allegations that her son is a spy for the @entity6 , saying that anything he confessed to was coerced
@entity3 authorities allege that @entity9 entered the country to infiltrate its intelligence system in order to accuse @entity3 of involvement in terrorist activities , according to the semi-official @entity16 news agency
" we are deeply concerned for the fate and well - being of @entity9 , " @entity9 's mother , @entity17 , said in a statement wednesday
" we are also disturbed by the video and reports coming from the @entity3 court that describe @entity9 admitting to being a spy
it is clear to me and our entire family that @entity9 is speaking under duress
" the @entity1 also has called the accusations false
according to @entity16 , @entity9 told a judge tuesday that he worked for the @entity6 and that he was to get paid for delivering information to @entity3 's intelligence ministry
he also told the judge he felt he had been duped and that he had planned on not returning to the @entity1 , @entity16 reported
@entity9 's mother called the reported admission " totally false
" " it is an indication that he is not speaking freely but being forced to say something that is n't true , " she said
" @entity9 has many financial and business investments in the @entity1 and would never walk away from them
" @entity9 , a former @entity44 , was arrested in august while visiting his grandmother and other relatives , his family in @entity43 said last week
up until wednesday , they had remained quiet about the arrest at the urging of @entity3 officials , who promised his release , they said
" in this environment @entity9 is a victim , " his mother said
" we are convinced that there is a mistake or misunderstanding
we pray and hope he will be allowed to come home soon
" the @entity61 said their son served in the @entity44 from 2001 to 2005
later , he started his own linguistics company and contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses
his military contracts included cultural competency training
he worked with troops at military bases to promote understanding of , and positive communication , with people of other cultures , his family said
@entity16 reported that @entity9 said he worked for the @entity77 for four years and later the @entity6 , where he was sent to @entity78 and had access to secret documents
@entity9 was supposed to give his information to the @entity3 in two parts -- the first part for free , and if they liked it he would ask for $ 500,000 for the second part , according to @entity16
@entity9 said he was to get a receipt from the intelligence ministry for the money , @entity16 reported
the judge speculated whether the receipt would later be used as evidence linking @entity3 to terrorist activities , @entity16 reported
if @entity3 had paid , @entity9 told the judge , he would have kept the money and lived in @entity3 , according to @entity16
@entity9 's attorney told the judge his client had been tricked by " @entity99 " -- referring to the @entity1 -- and argued that intent to commit a crime is n't a crime in itself .
