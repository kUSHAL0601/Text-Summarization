-- @entity2 state television announced late friday that the leader of @entity2 's coup , captain @entity5 , and the @entity6 have agreed to a plan under which the coup leaders will hand over power to the civilian government in exchange for the end of trade and diplomatic sanctions
the statement was read in @entity16 over @entity17 , the state tv network
the parties agreed to set up a transition process leading to a presidential election , @entity5 said
a transitional prime minister will lead the transition " to manage the crisis in the north of @entity2 and to organize free , transparent and democratic elections in accordance with a road map , " he said
the international community -- including @entity30 states , the @entity31 and the @entity32 -- had called for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule
the @entity31 and @entity6 had also slapped the military junta with travel and economic restrictions , and had frozen its assets
sanctions targeted the supporters and relatives of the military junta and all those involved in contributing to the " destabilization " of @entity2 , the @entity31 said
under the sanctions , five neighboring nations were to close their borders to landlocked @entity2 except for humanitarian purposes and deny the nation access to their ports , freeze its accounts in regional banks , and suspend its participation in cultural and sporting events
the announcement of a promised return to civilian rule came shortly after separatist rebels , who had captured large areas of @entity2 's vast @entity60 region in the north of the country , declared independence for a region they call @entity66
the declaration was made in a statement posted online by the secretary general of the @entity70 ( @entity70 )
the claim of independence followed " more than 50 years of corruption and poor governance with the complicity of the army and the politicians , putting people 's lives at risk in @entity66 , " the @entity70 said
in a statement , the @entity31 expressed its " total rejection " of the rebels ' independence claim
the @entity31 will do all it can to restore the authority of the government of @entity2 to its entire territory and " bring to an end the attacks being carried out by armed and terrorist groups in the northern part of the country , " it said
@entity16 defense minister @entity92 said the declaration of independence in northern @entity2 was meaningless if it was not recognized by @entity30 states
@entity96 is the former colonial power in @entity2
the @entity100 rebels ' seizure of northern @entity2 followed a military coup last month that toppled the government and threw the country into turmoil
the rebels had called a cease - fire thursday , saying they had captured key territory in the @entity60 region and achieved their military mission
the @entity100 , who consider @entity66 to be the cradle of their nomadic civilization , launched an insurgency in january to achieve a separate homeland
the conflict has uprooted more than 200,000 people from their homes
buoyed by the chaos after last month 's coup , the rebels swept through the north and wrested control of several strategic cities , including @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126
the rebels effectively split the @entity30 nation in two , and northern areas remained volatile and tense , preventing aid agencies from accessing displaced people , the @entity128 refugee agency said thursday
@entity6 representatives met thursday in the @entity136 capital , @entity137 , to discuss possible military intervention in @entity2 to restore democratically elected @entity139 to the presidency
after the march 22 coup , @entity2 , long a shining example of democracy and stability in @entity144 , was plunged into crisis
@entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 experienced days of looting , abductions and chaos after they were occupied by armed groups late last week
in the capital , @entity152 , the military leaders who had overthrown the president because of his alleged inability to handle the @entity100 rebellion postponed plans thursday for a national convention aimed at addressing political woes
