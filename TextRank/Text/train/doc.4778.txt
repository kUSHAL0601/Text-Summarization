the man suing ex-nfl star @entity1 for shooting him in the face has responded to @entity1 's request for a delay in the lawsuit until his murder charges in @entity7 are resolved
@entity11 , in a motion filed by his lawyer on september 12 , argues there 's no reason for a delay , because the cases are completely unrelated with no overlapping issues
his attorneys further state any additional delays would be " highly prejudicial " to @entity11 's case because there is no way of telling how long @entity1 's murder case will take to come to a conclusion
in court papers , @entity11 's attorneys maintain " delaying this case , for what could be years , would be extremely prejudicial to mr. @entity11 in terms of seeking compensation for the very severe injuries he suffered as a result of being shot in the eye
" grand jury calls 2 to testify in deaths possibly linked to @entity1 @entity11 is suing @entity1 , claiming the then - @entity37 tight end shot @entity11 in february after the two got into a fight at a @entity41 strip club
in a lawsuit filed in june , @entity11 said @entity1 fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that @entity1 intentionally " possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have
" @entity11 said he lost the sight in one eye and continues to receive treatment
in a motion filed in early september by his lawyers , @entity1 argues that he 's unable to defend himself while battling murder and weapons charges stemming from the execution - style killing in june of @entity55
@entity11 appeared in july before a grand jury investigating @entity55 's death
prosecutors wo n't comment on why @entity11 was called to testify , citing the secrecy of the proceedings
however , one of @entity11 's lawyers has asserted the grand jury likely wanted to relate @entity1 's alleged conduct in @entity65 to @entity55 's slaying in @entity7
@entity1 's lawyers state " it is beyond any reasonable contention that the issues in @entity70 ( @entity7 ) ... overlap those of this case
" @entity1 pleads not guilty in court papers , @entity1 maintains it would be difficult to adequately defend himself against @entity11 's suit while simultaneously battling a murder charge from a jail cell where he 's being held without bail
his lawyers also argue that if he had to answer questions in the civil lawsuit during an ongoing criminal case , he would be forced to invoke the @entity83 to protect himself from self - incrimination
in some jurisdictions , they add , invoking the @entity83 would amount to an admission of guilt
@entity11 's attorneys say this argument should not be " well taken , " citing case law that says use of the @entity83 privilege does not compel an adverse judgment and the mere possibility of suffering a disadvantage does not justify the issuance of a stay
messages to @entity1 's lawyers were not answered
@entity1 , who pleaded not guilty in @entity55 's death , is next expected to appear in court on october 8 in @entity102 , @entity7 .
