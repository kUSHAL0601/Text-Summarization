in @entity1 , bribery is known colloquially as " tea money " and nearly everyone from local businesses to foreign multinationals has usually had a brush with it
the practice is so widespread that in @entity13 -- a steel town in @entity10 -- a group of artists even made a cheeky exhibition of the official receipts they received for bribes they paid to build their preposterous iceberg - shaped headquarters in town
kick - backs in @entity1 are often demanded through semi-official means and getting paperwork for overly rigorous fire safety regulations , for instance , is typically one way of oiling the wheels of officialdom
news this month that @entity1 has slipped from 80th position to 100 , tied with @entity31 and @entity32 , in @entity34 's @entity33 of 174 countries may come as no surprise to those who live with bribery and graft on a daily basis
' @entity41 and flies ' yet , the result has thrown a question mark @entity1 president @entity46 's " tigers and flies " campaign
when @entity46 took office in 2012 , he promised to root out endemic corruption and used a slogan made famous by former dictator @entity51 to show that not even high officials would be safe from his anti-corruption drive

luxury goods maker @entity59 said in july that its sales of cognac , handbags and watches had all taken a hit amid challenging business conditions following @entity1 's anti-corruption drive
nevertheless , according to @entity34 , @entity1 's poor score this year may be a sign that deep - rooted and systemic problems are finally being addressed
" when countries start trying to address corruption they lift up the stone to see what 's underneath and it often looks an awful lot worse than you thought it was , " executive director of @entity34 @entity78 told @entity79
perceptions of graft he said that because corruption was often difficult to measure , the index surveyed perceptions among country experts such as businesspeople , diplomats and journalists
" what happens is that when countries begin to address corruption , actually the perceptions get worse before they get better
" he said for many countries trying to roll back corruption , the starting place is getting more transparency and accountability in the system
" but what @entity1 seems to be doing is having an anti-corruption drive without introducing transparency and accountability which means you ca n't really tell what 's happening
" without a free press or social media , he said it was quite hard for @entity1 citizens to know how widespread the crackdown was or how seriously the authorities were prosecuting it
" it may be that @entity1 is very vigorously pursuing an anti-corruption campaign , but it wo n't get the credit for that success if it does not have greater transparency
" gifts and hospitality while graft may often be standard practice in @entity1 , where it is usually disguised as gifts and hospitality , the victims of corruption are often those who can least afford it
@entity78 said that one of the essential tests was whether the money that was being paid ended up with the state or with the individual it was paid to
" in general , people around the world do become very accepting of corruption , not because they like it but because it seems so monolithic , " he said
" this is where we feel social media has had such a transformative effect in many countries because it encourages people to band together by putting information out
" and that is one of the issues with @entity1 -- the mechanisms that have worked elsewhere are not going to work there because the state control of information is so very strong
" ' biggest fall ' @entity1 's slump in the index was one of the " biggest falls " of 2014 , @entity147 said
other countries whose rankings dropped were @entity155 , which dropped five points , and @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , which all dropped four
@entity160 and @entity161 ranked equal - worst of 174 countries , with a score of just eight
@entity164 and @entity165 ranked least corrupt , with scores of 92 and 91 , respectively
" the @entity34 report is inconsistent with @entity1 's well - known achievements in the anticorruption campaign , " @entity1 @entity168 spokesperson @entity167 told @entity79 when the report was released earlier this month
" the public will judge the achievement that the government has obtained and it will not be affected by the index
" @entity78 said that despite @entity1 's official line on corruption , many people were taking their discontent to the streets and protesting about graft
" if you 're not very rich in the first place and to get a state service you should be entitled to for free like healthcare or education and you have to pay a bribe in addition to the fact you 're also very poor , then clearly people feel it
