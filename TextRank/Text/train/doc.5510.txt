@entity0 launched into internet superstardom last week for helping guide the rover curiosity in its journey to the surface of @entity5
well , that and his red - and - black @entity6
president @entity8 even acknowledged @entity0 , now commonly referred to as the " @entity0 , " in a congratulatory call to @entity11 's @entity10 on monday
" it does sound like @entity11 has come a long way from the white - shirt , black dark - rimmed glasses and the pocket protectors , " @entity8 told the @entity13 team
" you guys are a little cooler than you used to be
" " i , in the past , thought about getting a @entity6 myself -- but my team keeps on discouraging me , " @entity8 joked
stylish despite medical setbacks when it comes to personal style in the workplace , there are no hard and fast rules
what is suitable changes with where you work and what you do
fortunately , some sartorial adventurers are able to reconcile their need to express themselves with their need for a paycheck
" dress codes have most certainly relaxed over time , particularly since the introduction of ' jeans fridays ' and dot - com era casual attire , " said @entity36 , of @entity38 group , a human resources consulting firm in @entity40 , @entity41
" what is considered ' appropriate ' varies by company and culture , as well as what parts of the house are strictly internal versus client / public facing , " " dress code policies walk a fine line between portraying a professional image to clients and customers while allowing employees to be comfortable , engaged , and expressive , " said @entity53 , senior vice president of hr optimization at @entity54 , also in @entity40
@entity61 , a 43 - year - old technical writer from @entity62 , @entity63 , says it 's crucial to have some personal branding around -- whether it 's funky jewelry , photos of loved ones or favorite movie and music memorabilia -- to keep you sane at work
" no matter how great your job and co-workers may be , the corporate world can be very stressful and draining
it 's all too easy to become devoured by your job and to forget that there are things outside of the cubicle and status reports , " she said
" maintaining your own sense of identity helps you stay grounded , and reminds you that you are more than your job
" known as the " goth at the office , " @entity61 might sport a top hat , knee - length lace coat and a full petticoat skirt on an average workday
she attempts to document each day 's ensemble on her @entity96 account
while she has endured her fair share of funny looks and moments when she needed to tone down her appearance , @entity61 says ultimately her sense of style benefits her career
" i 've walked into interviews and had the hiring manager say , ' oh right , you 're the goth girl
i 've heard good things about you and you know all our tools
can you start on monday ? ' " @entity61 said
" once i 've started on a job and met my co-workers , everyone remembers who i am , which is great for gathering information
" dying careers and thriving careers : the jobs of tomorrow like @entity61 , @entity120 , a @entity121 - based empowerment coach and business strategist , thinks it 's important to encourage the uniqueness of others without judgment because it emboldens both confidence and creativity
" studies have shown that when we look good on the outside , we feel good on the inside , and what 's important to recognize is that everyone has their own unique feelings about what makes them look and feel their best , " she said
" why try to inhibit that ? " with blue streaks running through her hair , @entity120 said " expressing yourself in a way that makes you feel like your best self is the new power suit
" @entity5 rover mission 's ' @entity0 ' inspires @entity8 of course , some people believe corporate dress code policy should remain sacred
@entity150 theme parks came under fire last month after job applicant @entity152 , an engineering student at @entity155 , claimed she was denied a summer job because of her dreadlocks hairstyle
@entity158 started a @entity160 petition to protest what she claimed were @entity150 ' discriminatory policies against people with dreadlocks
a @entity150 spokeswoman confirmed that the company does not permit employees to wear dreadlocks
" we maintain a grooming code for employees that includes standard uniforms and no visible tattoos , beards , dreadlocks or extreme hairstyles ( such as drastic variations in color or partially shaven heads ) , " said @entity170 , senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications
many companies have formal dress code policies , including @entity185 which has a 44 - page document with specific stipulations that disallow women from wearing more than seven pieces of jewelry and men from wearing cufflinks
@entity193 , the director of operations for @entity195 in the @entity196 , thinks maintaining a proper dress code shows respect for your employer , clients and yourself
" would you purchase an expensive piece of fine jewelry from a woman with a green @entity6 and sleeve full of tats ? that 's why i wear a suit to work every day
my personal expression can wait until my day off , " she said
while it 's ultimately up to each organization 's culture to deem what is fit , human resource professionals , like @entity53 and @entity36 , say general dress guidelines are useful as they create some parameters and expectations around what is considered appropriate
at the same time , allowing some freedom of individual expression can have positive impacts on company culture and employee satisfaction
" you may be memorable , but make sure you are memorable for the right reasons , " said @entity36
" be yourself , but do n't let your appearance or behaviors detract from your selling points : your intelligence , accomplishments , strengths and experience
