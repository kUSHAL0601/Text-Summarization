@entity0 -- onlookers laughed and did nothing to help as a man was beaten , stripped and robbed on the street in @entity0
the attack , which police say happened on march 18 after @entity9 celebrations , was captured by at least two cameras
video of it went viral
" not only did they rob him , but they attempted to strip him of his dignity
they tore his clothes off ; they mocked him
that behavior just will not be tolerated , " said detective @entity19 with the @entity0 police
police say they have identified one suspect , but have made no arrests
they are not releasing the victim 's identity except to say he was a 31 - year - old man from @entity28 , @entity29
the victim was on the way to his hotel from a downtown @entity0 club when he was attacked , according to a police report
the man had been drinking
he told police he could n't recall exactly what happened , but the videos fill in the blanks
in them , a man is seen standing , unsteadily , against a row of mailboxes
a crowd starts to gather and women dance suggestively against him
someone notices his watch and a hand seems to grab something from one of the man 's front pockets
he pursues the supposed thief and is punched in the face
the man falls over backward and his head hits the sidewalk so hard it can be heard on the video
" @entity60 ! " someone yells
his pockets are rifled and his clothes pulled off
some people can be heard laughing
no one comes to his aid
according to the police report , the man lost his @entity69 watch , which he valued at $ 1,300 , his @entity70 and car key
@entity1 showed video of the attack to a number of people in @entity0 to gauge their response
" that 's pretty sad , " said @entity77 of @entity29 , who was visiting the city with family
" i mean he obviously did n't do anything to anybody
they just got up on him and started beating him
" @entity1 's @entity85 contributed to this report .
