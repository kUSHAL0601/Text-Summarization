@entity0 -- several police officials and politicians are pointing fingers at @entity6 mayor @entity5 after two @entity6 police officers were murdered on saturday , following weeks of protests against police treatment of minorities in @entity6 and around the country
and one is pulling the @entity13 into the fray
the head of @entity6 's police union said @entity5 has blood on his hands , and the state 's former @entity20 governor called out @entity5 and @entity23 attorney general @entity22
former @entity6 mayor and one - time @entity20 presidential candidate @entity25 appeared to sympathize with @entity5 on sunday , instead dragging in president @entity26
" we 've had four months of propaganda starting with the president , that everybody should hate the police
i do n't care how you want to describe it , that 's what those protests are all about , " @entity25 said sunday on @entity32
@entity25 added on @entity1 that while none were responsible for the shooting , @entity5 , @entity22 and @entity26 are fueling " intense , anti-police hatred
" " maybe , just maybe , they should spend the next four months not talking about police hatred , but talking about what they are going to do about bringing down crime in the community , " he said , adding that it 's police officers and not @entity26 , @entity22 or any mayors who are saving lives
protests broke out around the country in the wake of two separate cases in which grand juries declined to charge white police officers in the killing of two unarmed black men , @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62 , in @entity6
@entity26 has sympathized with protesters ' frustrations , drawing on his own experiences as a black man , and urged protesters to express themselves peacefully
former gov. @entity68 blamed @entity5 and @entity22
and the head of @entity70 's police union , @entity71 , pointed the finger at @entity5 , saying there 's blood on the hands of those supporting the protestors and it " starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor
" @entity25 also condemned rev. @entity82 , one of the main organizers and supporters of the protest movement , for creating an atmosphere of " strong anti-police hatred in certain communities
" " and for that they should be ashamed of themselves , " @entity25 said
@entity82 strongly condemned the attacks on sunday
@entity25 said asking for @entity5 's resignation and blaming him for the killings of the two @entity70 officers " goes too far , " but said @entity5 should be more forceful in policing the protests that have on several occasions taken over major streets in @entity6
@entity98 sen. @entity98 of @entity99 made his position clear on @entity101 as the blame game evolved
" i blame the shooter and nobody else , " he said
" the tone they 're setting around the rhetoric regarding the cops incites crazy people
but i blame the shooter
" mayor @entity5 condemned the killings on saturday night , calling the double - murder a " heinous attack " that " was an attack on our entire city , " which he said " tears at the foundation of our society
" rep. @entity119 , a @entity120 who represents parts of @entity6 , lauded those comments and said @entity5 and protest leaders have tried to " bring people together " to discuss minority communities ' concerns about the criminal justice system
" we stand with the police department
no one has ever given up on the police department or said we were anti-police department
what we were crying for was saying how african - americans feel , how their communities are policed and want the justice system to work for everyone , " @entity119 said on @entity133 's " @entity132
" @entity119 and other members of the @entity140 expressed outrage at the non-indictment of the two white police officers in the @entity59 and @entity62 cases and have led the outcry in @entity0
@entity146 , a former @entity6 police commissioner , also knocked @entity5 for not standing with police officers , accusing him of running an anti-police election campaign when he campaigned against the stop and frisk policies
@entity146 , also speaking on " @entity132 , " said @entity5 's comments about teaching his black son how to deal with police led up to the police murders on saturday
" i think when the mayor made statements about that he had to train his son to be -- his son who is biracial -- to be careful when he 's dealing with the police , i think that set off this latest firestorm , " @entity146 said .
