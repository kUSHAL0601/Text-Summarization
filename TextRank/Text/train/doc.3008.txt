@entity0 -- it was supposed to be a cakewalk for @entity4
@entity4 felt so comfortable that the @entity8 majority leader was n't in his @entity10 , @entity11 , district in june on the day of his @entity13 primary election
he lost -- badly -- to a little - known economics professor in one of the great @entity17 political upsets
how did the pundits and pollsters get it so wrong , and what does that mean for november 's congressional elections ? here are five reasons to approach any prognostication with caution this time around : 1 ) @entity28 turnout while more than half of eligible voters turn out for presidential elections , the percentage drops sharply in midterm balloting for all 435 @entity8 seats and about a third of the @entity36
in @entity4 's 7th district race in @entity11 , well below 20 % of eligible voters cast ballots on the day he lost
such a low turnout makes the outcome more vulnerable to unpredictable factors such as bad weather , a campaign misstep or crossover voting -- in this case , @entity46 who may have voted for tea party - backed @entity48 in an effort to oust @entity4 , the seven - term congressman considered a possible future house speaker
brat beat @entity4 by more than 7,000 votes out of 65,000 cast
in 2012 , the turnout for the district 's @entity13 primary was about 47,000 votes , and there was no way to determine how many of the 18,000 additional voters this year were @entity46
2 ) national mood most observers think the more public distaste for @entity66 and politics , the lower the turnout in congressional elections
by that measure , polling stations may be particularly barren come november 4
approval for @entity66 is near record lows , and a @entity75 poll in early august showed that for the first time , a majority of @entity17 disapproved of their own representatives
" @entity17 like to vote for someone , not against someone , " said @entity1 polling director @entity79
" if they perceive the ballot as a choice between the lesser of two evils , that 's one more excuse not to vote , and in midterms a lot of @entity17 do n't need many excuses to simply stay at home
" facing such a disgruntled electorate , both parties seek to energize their respective bases to try to gain a turnout advantage
republicans frame the election as the chance to increase their @entity8 majority and regain control of the @entity36 , which would strengthen the party 's ability to minimize or defeat the policies of @entity46 president @entity101
@entity46 reach out to demographics that traditionally support them -- single women , minorities and younger voters -- but traditionally do n't turn out strongly in midterm elections
3 ) polling problems changing dynamics make effective polling more challenging
@entity4 's pollster badly underestimated the turnout for june 's primary , perhaps because he failed to anticipate @entity46 crossovers and conservative disenchantment with his candidate
whatever the reason , difficulty in knowing who will vote makes predicting the outcome a major challenge
along with unorthodox tactics such as crossover voting , pollsters have a tougher time reaching a growing number of prospective voters through traditional methods
for example , fewer young voters have land - line telephones , the traditional polling medium for decades , meaning surveys must adapt by incorporating cellphone and @entity136 outreach to properly reflect the population
4 ) beware of the aggregate polls many popular websites simply take whatever polls they can find and average them together
some use more sophisticated mathematical models , but the principle is the same : the end product is only as good as the data it is based on
" computer programmers used to say , ' garbage in , garbage out , ' and that 's true for virtually any mathematical model , " @entity79 said
" let 's say you have 10 polls in a state and five of them are partisan polls that are trying to spin the data for their candidate , three of them are cutting corners on their methodology , one of them is flat - out making the data up , and only one is a legitimate poll
" the lone legitimate poll will get " swamped " in any aggregate model by the questionable polls , he continued , adding : " unfortunately , there are at least a few states where the skunky polls vastly outnumber the good ones
" 5 ) it 's all local " all politics is local , " former house speaker @entity176 famously said , and that is particularly true in congressional elections
while voting takes place in all 50 states , the competition involves the district congressional races and statewide @entity36 races
that means an outcome of national significance can hinge on the result from a particular district or state
for example , which party wins a majority in the @entity36 depends on the outcomes of half a dozen races , including contests involving incumbent democrats in @entity199 and @entity200
" if it 's sunny and warm in 48 states on @entity203 and cold and rainy in @entity199 and @entity200 , control of the @entity36 could be determined by intensely local weather conditions , " @entity79 noted
@entity1 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .
