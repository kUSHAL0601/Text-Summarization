after more than 800,000 @entity2 voters said they want the island to become the 51st @entity5 state , the @entity0 is calling on lawmakers to take action
" @entity10 should now study the results closely , and provide the people of @entity13 with a clear path forward that lays out the means by which @entity13 themselves can determine their own status , " @entity0 spokesman @entity8 told reporters this week
last month 's statehood referendum in @entity13 was nonbinding , but it was the first time such a measure garnered a majority of votes ; 61 % of voters who cast ballots on that question said they supported the island commonwealth becoming a @entity5 state
critics say the two - part plebiscite on @entity13 's status was unclear and does n't accurately represent the will of the island
even the @entity0 has n't been clear about what the vote means , they say
" democracy should never be used to confuse people
... i 'm sorry they are confused in the @entity0 , " said @entity2 sen. @entity35 of the @entity36
the first ballot question asked @entity2 voters whether they supported the island 's status as a @entity5 commonwealth ; 54 % of them said no. in response to the second question , which asked voters to select an alternative , 61 % of those who cast ballots chose statehood , but more than 480,000 people abstained from voting on that question
" they could have voted for statehood , if they had really supported it , " said @entity51 , senator - elect for the @entity52 , which supports the island becoming its own sovereign republic
" when you combine all the votes , statehood does n't appear as the true winner in the second question about non-colonial options
" one thing is clear , the @entity0 spokesman said monday : @entity13 " want a resolution to the issue of the island 's political status
" @entity10 action in @entity73 would be necessary for @entity13 to become a state
@entity75 has long been a thorny issue in @entity13 , with political parties sharply divided over the matter
those who support statehood say last month 's vote is a sign that change is coming , despite what critics say
" if they do n't want to pay attention to it , let them not pay attention , " said @entity86 , @entity13 's secretary of state
" but the @entity0 is paying attention
" a law passed in 1917 made @entity13 @entity5 citizens
but the @entity97 island 's roughly 4 million residents can not vote for president under its status as a commonwealth , @entity13 is subject to @entity5 federal laws , though island residents are exempt from some federal taxes
@entity13 has a nonvoting representative in @entity10
after last month 's referendum , @entity86 said an economic downturn and shrinking population contributed to the support for statehood , where as referendums in 1967 , 1993 and 1998 failed
" i think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need , " he said
an exodus of residents from the island has culminated in a staggering statistic : 58 % of @entity13 live in the mainland @entity5 , @entity86 said
" when you have a political status that scares away half of your population , " he said , " it is time to reject that political status
