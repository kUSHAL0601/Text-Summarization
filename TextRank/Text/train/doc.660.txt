@entity0 -- overcrowding inside a cathedral where @entity3 had gathered to pay last respects to their pope caused a stampede that left three people dead and more than 50 injured , a health official said
coptic pope @entity9 , who led the @entity11 community for more than four decades , died saturday
on sunday , thousands of @entity12 paid their respects to him at the @entity11 cathedral in @entity0 where his body went on display in an elaborate golden crown and red and golden robes
the mass of people inside the cathedral prompted the stampede , according to deputy health minister @entity23 , who said three were killed and 52 injured , most suffering from lack of oxygen and low blood pressure
@entity9 's funeral will be held early this week and is expected to bring millions of @entity12 onto the streets of @entity30 at a time when tensions with the @entity34 majority are high
@entity30 's @entity36 minority has been the target of a number of high - profile attacks in the past several years
the bombing of a major church in @entity42 in january 2011 left at least 21 people dead , and at least 25 @entity3 and their supporters were killed in clashes with the army in october
that incident was the bloodiest in @entity30 since its revolution in february
@entity12 are a very small minority in @entity30 , although the @entity36 is the largest @entity36 church in the @entity50 , according the @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53
the @entity54 estimates that @entity30 is roughly 9 % @entity36 , but the @entity55 , which released a report on the global @entity36 population last year , says it is probably closer to 5 %
@entity30 did not release the number of @entity12 in its 2006 census , the think tank said
the leader of the @entity62 since 1971 , @entity9 was in poor health off and on for many years
he traveled to the @entity64 to undergo medical tests last year
he died of renal failure " due to the diabetes he endured for years , " said @entity69 , head of the @entity30 general @entity70
the pope had lung cancer , which spread to the rest of his body , @entity69 said
" the funeral is expected to take place in two days , as massive preparations must take place first
it is a historical event and 2 million people are expected to attend the prayers
i do n't expect violence though , " @entity69 said
@entity30 's @entity84 announced sunday three days of mourning for the @entity62
@entity9 will be buried tuesday at @entity87 monastery in @entity88 , northwest of @entity30 's capital , said @entity90 , spokesman for the @entity36
the area is home to some of the world 's earliest @entity36 monasteries
@entity9 , a journalist in his youth , was once sentenced to spend four years in @entity88 by the late president @entity97
in addition to millions of followers in @entity30 , the @entity11 church has adherents in @entity102 , @entity103 , the @entity64 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107
@entity64 president @entity108 and his wife offered their condolences saturday after news of @entity9 's death spread , saying he will be remembered as " a man of deep faith , a leader of a great faith , and an advocate for unity and reconciliation
" " his commitment to @entity30 's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together , " the @entity120 said
when a coptic pope dies , all 150 bishops of the church 's @entity129 appoint an acting patriarch until a vote is conducted for a successor , @entity69 said
thousands of bishops , priests and monks are eligible to vote
the most senior bishop usually takes the role of acting patriarch
in this case , that would be bishop @entity143
if he declines , @entity144 of @entity145 is next in line , @entity69 said .
