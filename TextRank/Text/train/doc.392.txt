@entity0 -- @entity3 investigators are trying to figure out how a 5 - month - old baby died on a baggage carousel at an airport in @entity7
a spokeswoman for @entity3 's airport authority , @entity10 , said thursday it 's not clear how the baby ended up on the baggage belt for oversized luggage
" the baby was on the baggage carousel , but could not have gotten there alone
someone had to put the baby there
i do n't know how the baby got there , " said the airport spokeswoman , who by custom is not identified
the infant 's mother , an @entity28 woman , arrived at the airport late wednesday on a flight from @entity33 's @entity32 airport with her baby and another young child , the spokeswoman said
the father , who is @entity37 , was already there waiting at the @entity7 airport , she added
the baggage carousel is a flat , black rubber - type belt that moves only in one direction and is only activated when oversized bags are sent out on it for pickup
it 's several feet long and passengers can stand on either side of it or at the receiving end , the spokeswoman said
she said it was not immediately known if the infant was placed on the belt while it was stopped , or once it had started moving
an unidentified security officer at the airport told @entity1 affiliate @entity59 she did n't see the incident , but was told that " the mother apparently put ( the baby ) down on the conveyer belt when she went to reach for something
he was crushed by the conveyer belt and it killed him
" @entity70 medical personnel rushed to the scene but were unable to revive the infant , the spokeswoman said
the @entity73 said the baby 's death appears to be an accident , but an investigation is under way
at a loss : comforting grieving parents after the baby was pronounced dead , the family had to wait for a judge to arrive , by @entity3 law , so that the body could be moved
@entity87 took statements from the parents at the airport , the airport spokeswoman said
the baggage belt for oversized luggage -- which includes infant car seats and baby strollers -- is at one end of a large baggage claims hall at the @entity7 airport , which handles 9 million passengers a year , the spokeswoman said
the baggage carousel is in a secure area , and passengers go through it to claim their bags before they exit into the public arrivals hall
the father of the baby would not have had access to that area , the airport spokeswoman said
@entity73 and @entity112 spokesmen confirmed the nationalities of the mother and father as @entity28 and @entity37 , respectively
a @entity28 @entity117 spokesman in @entity0 said that @entity28 consular officials are aware of the incident and are providing assistance
a spokeswoman for the @entity117 in @entity0 said she could not comment and referred inquiries to the @entity37 government 's @entity123 in @entity125
@entity3 newspaper @entity126 reported the family had come to the @entity7 area , on @entity3 's @entity130 coast , for vacation , but authorities would not immediately confirm that
