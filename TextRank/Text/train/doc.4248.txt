@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's traditional iron - handed approach to the media has taken a surprise turn of tolerance with @entity8 's soft handling of a recent dispute with local reporters , in what could well become a more open attitude toward the media under the incoming administration of presumed new president @entity15
the new openness is being driven in large part by pragmatism , as the government realizes that both traditional and newer media can serve as powerful tools for achieving many of its goals in the country 's modernization
the recent conflict between reporters at the progressive @entity28 and local propaganda officials over a censorship incident left many guessing how the government would respond to the first clash of its kind in @entity1 for more than 20 years
the result was a surprisingly mild approach , including mediation by a high - level government official and a vague promise for less censorship in the future
the unusually tolerant tack could well reflect a new attitude by @entity15 and other incoming leaders set to take control of @entity1 for the next decade , all of whom have come to realize the media can serve many important functions beyond its traditional role as a propaganda machine
at the top of @entity15 's list is the fight against corruption , a problem he has mentioned frequently since taking the helm of the @entity57 last year
the party has tried to tackle the problem for years using its own internal investigations , but progress was slow until recently due to protection many officials received through their own sprawling networks of internal relationships , known locally as guanxi
all that began to change in the last two years with the rapid rise of social media , most notably the @entity70 - like microblogs known as @entity71 that are now a pervasive part of the @entity74 landscape and count hundreds of millions of ordinary @entity1 among their users
those social media have become an important weapon for exposing corruption , allowing thousands of ordinary citizens to pool their resources and build cases against officials they suspect of using their influence for personal gain
this increasingly sophisticated machine was on prominent display last year in a case involving @entity90 , a local official in northwestern @entity92 province who infuriated the online community by smiling at the site of a horrific accident scene
@entity96 quickly turned their outrage into an online investigation , and uncovered photos of him wearing several luxury watches he could hardly afford on his government salary
as a result , the government ultimately opened an investigation into the matter and @entity90 was sacked from his posts
in addition to its role in battling corruption , the media has also emerged as an important tool for combating and addressing many of the other social problems that @entity1 is facing in its rapid modernization
barely a week goes by without a report on the latest national food safety scandal or case of illegal pollution in both traditional and social media , with such reports often followed by government investigations
@entity8 leaders have also discovered that the media can also be an important vehicle for improving communication between the government and general public -- something that was a low priority in previous eras when officials only cared about pleasing their higher - up party bosses
following a @entity8 directive in late 2011 , most local government agencies and other organizations have all established microblog accounts , which they use to keep the public informed about their latest activities and seek feedback on upcoming plans
such input has become a valuable way to temper traditional public mistrust toward the government , which historically did n't make much effort to include the public in any of its internal discussions
lastly , the government has also discovered that media , especially social media , can be an effective tool in gauging public opinion on everything from broader national topics like inflation down to very local issues like land redevelopment
such feedback was difficult to get in the past due to interference by local officials , who tried to filter out or downplay anything with negative overtones and play things up to their own advantage
as a result , central government officials often received incomplete pictures of what was happening in their own country
with all of these valuable roles to play , the media has become an increasingly important part of @entity8 's strategy in executing many of its top priorities
the government also realizes that a certain degree of openness is critical to letting the media perform many of those roles , which may explain its relatively tolerant approach in the recent @entity28 conflict
such tolerance is likely to continue under @entity15 's administration , helping to shift more power towards a field of increasingly emboldened reporters at both traditional and new media and away from their traditional propaganda masters
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .
