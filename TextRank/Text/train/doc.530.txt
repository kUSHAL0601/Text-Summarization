-- i do n't remember where i was going when that stray dog weaved across a busy street near my home
but i do remember turning the car around to rescue the white pup with large tan spots that looked more like stains , except for one heart - shaped patch on her side
as cars sped past , i stood at the side of the road and waited for her to get comfortable around me
eventually , she approached my extended hand and i was able to coax her into my car
i named the dog honey and worked with a local rescue group called @entity23 ( @entity23 ) to find the sweet pooch a forever home
not every encounter leads to a happy ending
but with care , you can help a stray dog find its forever home
@entity0 : 11 of the bravest dogs in history exercise caution : you do n't know the dog 's history , so it 's important to avoid getting bitten
that means remaining cautious as you approach the dog
if it has been roaming for a while , or lived chained outside , the dog may be overly skittish around humans
" if it 's afraid , a dog 's first instinct is to run and the safest thing is to let it go , " says @entity43 , a @entity44 police officer who also trains dogs
" if the dog 's hackles are raised and its tail is up , turn around and walk away
" he advises waiting for the dog to grow more comfortable around you , which may take some time
if you fear that the dog may be in danger of being hit by a car , place a call to your local animal control and provide a description of the dog , the area where you saw it and the location in which it was heading
if a stray dog becomes a regular sight in your neighborhood , try to build a relationship over time
@entity43 suggests keeping a few dog treats in your pocket so that the treats have your scent
leave them in that area each time you pass it , and hopefully the dog will grow more comfortable with you
when the opportunity arises , stand a safe distance from the dog and allow it to approach you
extend your hand , letting the dog sniff you
if it tolerates petting , proceed with caution and move slowly
@entity0 : tornado survivor says his dogs warned him start the search : when i found honey , our first stop was the neighborhood pet store , where i asked for help spreading the word about her
they kindly offered a leash so that i could safely transport her to my house
( unlike my rambunctious dog @entity100 , who hates car rides , @entity91 settled in and did n't make a peep
if anything , she seemed curious about the next leg of her journey
) you should also visit your nearby animal shelter to drop off fliers featuring the dog 's photo , a general description and contact information
limit interaction with your pets : until you have a better understanding of the dog 's health and temperament , it 's best to limit interaction with your pets
honey 's first destination at my home was the tub , where she got a good long bath
fleas dotted her white fur like pepper in a saltshaker
after the bath , we took a walk and i snapped a few photographs to post online
it took a few days before she got to meet my dog , @entity100
@entity43 says that your pets may take issue with others attempting to join their pack
during the first meeting , keep dogs leashed and limit interaction to sniffing until they become comfortable together
" even with dogs from the same litter , skirmishes will happen , " he warns
@entity0 : @entity151 shelters swamped by pets misplaced by storms schedule a checkup : since your new houseguest will be sticking around for a while , it 's best to schedule a checkup
your veterinarian can provide clues about the dog 's age and breed
the vet also can check for the presence of a microchip , which could ensure a happy reunion
if your vet is closed for the day , see if a 24 - hour emergency veterinary clinic is willing to quickly scan the dog for a chip
also , those chips are worthless without up - to - date information on file
pet owners : make sure you have submitted your most recent contact information to the chip company
your vet can provide info on how to upload new information
as for your stray , many vets offer discounted services
consider getting a rabies vaccination , too
if you want to get it spayed or neutered , there are low - cost options available
check the @entity192 website for programs that offer free or discounted programs in your area
once you get a clean bill of health , it is ok to gradually introduce the new animal to your pets
kids should never be left unattended around animals , especially when you do n't know the pet 's history
use extreme caution when allowing children to interact with the stray dog
@entity0 : how to make the vet less scary for your pet start spreading the news : it can take time for strays to reunite with their owners , if it happens at all
start building buzz about your new houseguest by posting fliers in the general vicinity of where you found your stray , as well as pet - friendly locations such as nearby dog parks , pet stores and veterinary clinics
sites like @entity230 allow you to post a free classified ad that lasts 180 days announcing your found pet
if there is no response after a few weeks , you may need to secure a forever home for the dog
connect with a rescue group : most county animal control facilities are packed with pets in need of homes , and they are reluctant to take in a stray
if you are willing to foster the dog for a while , a local rescue group may be the best way to help find a forever home
rescue groups are like pet pr firms , focused on finding the perfect love connection between pets and people
animal shelters happily work with rescue groups because it relieves overcrowding
in exchange , rescue groups set up adoption fairs and actively seek pet lovers to adopt. @entity0 : adopting a dog ? how to find the right fit your stray is already at an advantage because you can provide valuable information to prospective owners about its personality , age and demeanor around other people and pets
all of these details can help this animal find a home more quickly
under @entity278 's guidance , @entity91 also learned a few tricks such as how to pour on the charm during rescue fairs
the photo of honey that i took after her first bath was the one that sealed the deal for her future owner
thanks to that white dog with a heart - shaped patch on her side , i now travel everywhere with a leash , bottled water and a few dog treats in my car ... just in case life gets in the way
i encourage you to do the same
the next leg of your journey will never be the same
