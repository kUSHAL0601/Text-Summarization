@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 's trial of more than 100 people who it has linked to post-election unrest is a " sign of weakness " and shows that the @entity12 republic " is afraid of its own people , " @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 told @entity2 thursday
@entity6 is " afraid of the truth and the facts coming out , " secretary of state @entity3 said
" it is a show trial , there 's no doubt about it , " @entity18 told @entity2 's @entity19 in a wide - ranging interview to be broadcast on his " gps " program sunday
" it demonstrates i think better than any of us could ever say that this @entity6 leadership is afraid of their own people , and afraid of the truth and the facts coming out
" @entity18 spoke to @entity19 during her visit to @entity35
those on trial include @entity39 reporter @entity38 , who has dual citizenship in @entity6 and @entity41 , and @entity42 , an @entity6 - @entity4 scholar
the trial , which began over the weekend , is scheduled to resume saturday , according to @entity6 's semi-official @entity43
this week , the @entity44 issued a statement expressing deep concern for @entity47
" given that the charges facing mr. @entity42 are without foundation , we call on @entity6 's leadership to release mr. @entity42 without delay , " @entity44 spokesman @entity48 said tuesday , reading a prepared statement
" he has played absolutely no role in the election and poses no threat to the @entity6 government or its national security
" @entity48 said @entity60 has not been provided an attorney , which he is entitled to , and warned @entity6 that " the world is watching what is happening in @entity6 and will bear witness
" speaking on thursday , @entity18 said the @entity4 also has " expressed our concern about mr. @entity38 's confinement and trial " to @entity41 's government , and offered its help
all of those on trial in @entity6 -- who include @entity6 journalists and supporters of the opposition -- have been charged for their alleged roles in protests that followed last month 's disputed presidential election
the june 12 election gave president @entity82 a second term in office , but it also sparked a massive opposition movement that has regularly protested against the @entity6 leadership and has shaken the foundation of @entity6 's @entity12 theocracy
those on trial will be placed into three categories , according to @entity43 : the " plotters , intriguers , and planners of the riots " ; " the antagonists and those affiliated to foreign services " ; and " the opportunists , hooligans , and hoodlums who set ablaze , or destroyed private and public properties , and those that have had hands in disturbing public security
