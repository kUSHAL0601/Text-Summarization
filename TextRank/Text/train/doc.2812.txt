@entity4 , @entity1 @entity3 officials did n't pick up weather reports ahead of @entity8 's crash in person -- something that does n't mean the airline violated any policies but could mean it missed an opportunity for meteorologists to detail potentially dangerous conditions face - to - face , @entity1 's official weather service told @entity5
@entity19 , deputy director for meteorology at the weather agency @entity21 , said , " based on our records , there was no @entity3 flight operation officer that directly collected the flight document
" this practice appears to be common for @entity3 , according to @entity21 station chief @entity25
@entity5 did not see @entity3 listed in entries for a logbook running from december 31 to january 6 , for instance
the airline does n't dispute this , explaining it gets and distributes the same information not in person but by email
the documents are printed and brought onto the flight for pilots to see , @entity3 's @entity1 president director @entity34 told @entity5
one advantage of picking up such documents personally -- which in @entity4 , where @entity8 took off from december 28 , would be done at the @entity41 building -- is that it gives cockpit crew or airline operations staff a chance to review it with the meteorologist on duty , ask questions and get additional information , said @entity21 forecaster @entity49
but @entity3 argues that the official copy actually is n't as easy to read as the electronic version , which has the same information and comes in color
" our dispatch mirror the dispatch practices of numerous airlines globally , " @entity3 said in a statement
there 's been no apparent change in how the airline gets copies of weather information since @entity8 went down in the @entity62
but there 's now a change in how its staff process it : whereas pilots briefed themselves before the crash , there 's now a face - to - face briefing involving pilots and flights operations officers before each flight , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity66 said
@entity74 @entity75 @entity76 the @entity77 @entity78 @entity79 @entity80 @entity81 @entity83 @entity82 @entity84 @entity85 @entity86 @entity87 @entity88 @entity89 @entity87 @entity90 suspension of flight route @entity3 's handling of weather information is being investigated by @entity1 's transportation ministry , a top @entity1 aviation official told @entity5 on monday
it 's not the only thing
the airline 's practices have already come under scrutiny , including the fact @entity3 's @entity1 affiliate did n't have a license to fly the @entity4 - to - @entity106 route on the day that the plane disappeared , according to authorities
the airline was approved to fly the route four days a week but that did not include sunday , @entity1 's @entity109 said as it announced a full investigation and suspended @entity114 flights between the two cities
@entity114 has said it will cooperate fully with the investigation and would not be releasing any statement until the results were known , local media reported
but aviation authorities in @entity106 said there was no issue on their end
the @entity106 @entity123 said it had given @entity3 permission to fly the @entity4 - to - @entity106 route daily through march 28
it added that @entity3 was operating the flight four days a week , including sundays , but that " airlines may adjust their flight frequencies in the course of a season in response to market demand or operational requirements
" officials reassigned two officials in the @entity4 airport 's operations department have been reassigned , said the president director of the state - owned company that manages 13 airports in central and eastern @entity1
@entity140 said a department head and a section head were transferred monday at the order of the @entity109 and the @entity144 , pending an investigation
visibility an issue for searchers meanwhile , the search continues for wreckage and bodies from the @entity106 - bound flight , which went down with 162 people board after its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers
the cause of the disaster is still under investigation
big waves and visibility have been problems for searchers , according to officials
so far , 39 bodies have been found , and 16 of those have been identified publicly
three others have been identified , but officials still needed to inform their families
the aerial search began again wednesday morning just after dawn
the @entity172 has sent special equipment to try to tackle the muddy conditions , @entity1 military chief gen. @entity171 said monday
@entity176 divers assisting in the search have already been using side - scan sonar gear , which is designed to map the sea floor and capture accurate images for analysis
when they find submerged wreckage , divers could also face challenges like " jagged edges , torn fuselage , things hanging all over the place , " said @entity188 , an experienced commercial diver in the @entity189
" it 's going to be dark inside -- a lot of things for a diver to get snagged on , for its umbilical to get caught up on , to get disoriented , " said @entity188 , who says he 's helped in the aftermath of recent catastrophes , including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity194
highlighting the complexity of the challenge , @entity171 said monday that one large piece of wreckage initially believed to be part of the aircraft turned out to actually be from a ship
objects obscured by waves the ships and aircraft looking for remains from @entity8 have so far detected several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the commercial jet , according to @entity1 officials
but they still have n't located the main body of the plane and the all - important flight recorders
a locator beacon in at least one of the plane 's so - called black boxes was manufactured by @entity221 , the same company that built the beacons on the still - missing @entity223
but the search for the @entity3 flight is markedly different than the hunt for the missing @entity228 airliner , since wreckage has already been found
records show there are fresh batteries in at least one of the @entity3 plane 's beacons , which are designed to send out pinging sounds for 30 days after a crash to help searchers find the black boxes , @entity221 president @entity230 said
some of the bodies found over the weekend were still wearing seat - belts , search officials said
the bad weather conditions brought about by @entity1 's monsoon -- including strong winds , thick clouds , heavy rain and big waves -- have hindered the teams ' efforts during nine days of searching
" as soon as you see something in the distance , it disappears behind a wave -- and then it 's very difficult to try and spot it again , " said @entity5 's @entity251 , who spent 15 hours out on a search vessel sunday
how can a modern airliner vanish ? @entity260 reported from @entity4 , @entity1
@entity261 and @entity262 reported from @entity263
@entity5 's @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .
