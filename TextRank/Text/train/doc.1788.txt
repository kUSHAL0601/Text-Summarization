-- 1980s nostalgia is about to intensify
this week , @entity3 television will premiere its new show " @entity5 , " a sitcom about a suburban middle - class family in the 1980s that loves to yell and scream
the pilot promises to bring back memories of colorful leg warmers , @entity11 , @entity13 stores , and @entity15 electronic game units
" before there were parenting blogs , trophies for showing up , and peanut allergies , " the network 's online description says , " there was a simpler time called the ' 80s
" while the program will showcase the lighter side of @entity28 culture in the 1980s , we should remember the decade was anything but simple when it came to politics
there were huge changes that took place in this pivotal decade that continue to shape politics today
tax cuts and deregulation : the roots of our current economic policies lie in the 1980s
with @entity42 in the @entity43 , republicans were able to have a huge impact on taxation and regulation
one of @entity42 's signature changes was the tax reduction of 1981 , which significantly lowered income tax rates and weakened the ability of the federal government to raise revenue
while there have been tax increases since that time , the trajectory of the overall rate structure has generally moved downward , making it extremely difficult for the government to finance new programs without raising the deficit
the @entity42 administration was also very successful at promoting economic deregulation
the idea of deregulation had already gained bipartisan support in the 1970s
democrats like sen. @entity66 pushed for the deregulation of the airline industry to help consumers , while conservative economists like @entity71 championed deregulation to free up markets
but @entity42 sold the idea like no other politician before him
he believed that markets were superior to government at almost every turn
his aggressive push for deregulation of markets would continue to influence debate in the 1990s as @entity65 joined the @entity83 in dismantling @entity85 programs that had monitored financial markets
the nation paid the price with the devastating financial collapse of 2008
life and politics in the 1980s the end of the @entity93 : the end of the @entity93 started in the middle of the 1980s
while young americans such as @entity96 -- the middle child in the television show and the family upon which it is based -- were mostly worried about what cassette tapes they should buy and getting their first car , @entity42 entered into a series of historic negotiations with @entity106 president @entity105 between 1985 and 1987 that culminated with the signing of the @entity109 in 1987
following the treaty , the @entity106 would collapse in the years when @entity111 was in the @entity43
since the 1980s @entity28 foreign policy has been characterized by a shifting and murky battle against rogue states and terrorist networks
the battle lines have never offered voters or politicians the same kind of clarity as existed in the @entity93 , often making it more difficult to mobilize long - term support behind military operations and producing confusion about what policymakers are even trying to achieve
this was true even after 9/11 as the @entity28 became bogged down in a war in @entity130 that had little to do with the source of the attack
liberalization of social and cultural values : even with @entity42 and @entity111 in the @entity43 , @entity28 culture continued to embrace the values from the @entity137
during this decade , @entity28 were listening to more explicit lyrics in their music , watching television shows and movies that had more sexuality and violence , and listening to radio shows such as @entity145 's which abandoned the social inhibitions of the 1940s and 1950s , when the original " @entity5 " aired on radio and television
beyond entertainment , public health crises -- most importantly the spread of the deadly @entity154 virus -- required policymakers to have more honest talks with the public about sexual relations
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of activists marched on @entity161 to call on the federal government to devote more resources to combating @entity154
as homosexuality became less of a taboo , more gay @entity28 came out of the closet
there were also celebrities who made a difference
in 1985 , the publicist of the actor @entity171 , a very close friend of the president , announced that @entity171 had @entity154
although his people said it had resulted from a blood transfusion , the media soon reported that @entity171 had been gay
@entity28 were also living in a country that was becoming even more ethnically and culturally diverse , as the waves of immigration that had swept into the nation since the immigration reform of 1965 remade the cities and suburbs
@entity28 became familiar with the world that @entity184 , @entity185 and other immigrants were building
in recent years , @entity28 have been giving their strong support to gay rights and rejecting those who warn that recent developments , such as same - sex marriage , are pushing the nation in the wrong direction
there is also very little support for efforts to impose regulations on popular culture , and much more comfort that there is no danger in @entity28 ' having more honest discussions and cultural exposure to sexuality
while some conservatives adhere to hard - line positions on immigration restriction , national polls show that most @entity28 support a path to citizenship
the 24 - hour news media : in 1980 , @entity0 began , and the erosion of the era of network news dominance was under way
the network news established in the 1960s had revolved around three nightly news shows , each approximately a half - hour in length
@entity0 broke the mold when it began the 24 - hour news cycle from its @entity223 studios
with @entity0 , the flow of information was constant and it was much harder for politicians to respond to the emergence of stories
other cable news networks soon emerged , including @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 , as cable became a dominant mode of information
the @entity236 followed this same model , making the news cycle even more intense
this media cycle had a number of effects
it fragmented and decentralized the distribution of news information , making it more difficult for politicians , including the president , to reach broad national audiences , since viewers could tune in to a much wider variety of stations
once the @entity253 , which had required stations to give opposing viewpoints equal airtime , came to an end in 1987 , the cable networks could air more partisan newscasts
the proliferation of channels and the 24 - hour cycle intensified the competition among news outlets to release information as fast as possible and to find stories about political scandal and conflict that would attract viewers
this fueled the partisan polarization that was taking place in @entity161 during this decade
as viewers watch the antics of the @entity5 , remembering or learning about what life was like in long - ago suburbia , it 's worth thinking about the bigger changes that were taking place outside the home that have continued to shape our politics
the 1980s are much more than nostalgia
we live in the fast - changing world of the 21st century , yet ours is a society that owes much to the way things were three decades ago
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .
