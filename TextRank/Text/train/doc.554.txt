the recent deluge of @entity3 changes -- both those that have already happened and those that are on the way -- have people talking
ok ... that 's an understatement
they have people shouting ( with either glee or fury )
and , sometimes , freaking out
when a site has roughly 800 million users , and each of those users has a quick and easy way to share their thoughts with others , interest is high and info starts flying fast in the face of what looks like a pretty radical overhaul
inevitably , that leads to things getting a bit confused sometimes
so , here 's a look at some of the rumors that we 've seen flying around about @entity3 's big changes , along with our best effort to sort them out
@entity3 is going to start charging you do we actually have to address this one ? apparently , yes
every once in a while , this rumor starts cropping up in status updates -- often in all caps
some people ca n't seem to get their brains around the fact that a useful service like @entity3 is going to remain free
so people begin copying and pasting messages announcing the date the site is going to a pay model
a quick glimpse and you 'll find multiple " we wo n't pay for @entity3 " groups
so , of course , when all the new changes rolled out , the planets were aligned perfectly for the rumor to spring back up
this time , it apparently got so prevalent that @entity3 addressed it
" a rumor on the @entity60 caught our attention
we have no plans to charge for @entity3
it 's free and always will be , " the site posted on its own @entity3 page
here 's the deal : @entity3 will never really have a reason to start charging you for using it
to oversimplify the situation , you are n't @entity3 's customer
the site 's business model is based on advertising and it wants as many users as possible to dangle in front of the click - hungry advertisers
charging for @entity3 would inevitably decrease the number of users
and that would decrease advertising revenue
it 's not going to happen
friends will see the websites i visit , even when i 'm not on @entity3 this one is partially true , with one big " if
" with what @entity90 called " frictionless sharing , " @entity3 users can have the stories they 're reading on certain other websites pushed straight to their news feed for friends to share
but this will only happen on sites with the @entity3 " like " button -- and only when the user has given the site permission to share the info
that addresses one big privacy complaint @entity3 has been hit with in the past , when new features started automatically , requiring users to opt out instead of opting in
but there 's always the possibility for confusion
some people might not realize that they 're authorizing the feature or may simply forget they 've enabled it
in that case , best not to make a habit of reading a bunch of articles about how to find a new job if you 're @entity3 friends with your boss
verdict : @entity121 ( if you enable it ) 3
the timeline is going to show all my photos and info ( whether i want it to or not ) one of the biggest changes @entity3 is making is switching users ' profile pages into what 's being called a timeline
it will , in effect , make your profile look more like a blog , with a chronological stream of photos and posts from the entire time you 've been on @entity3 and even before
people viewing your profile will be able to scroll through , year by year , and see what you were up to far more easily than they can now
reports of that have led some users to freak out , or even say they planned to delete all their photos before the feature rolls out
here 's the deal : the timeline will definitely make it easier for your friends to see your photos and posts , particularly older ones
a single click could take them from your recent and respectable photos from office parties and play dates to those infamous college keggers from days of yore ( you know ... if you 're young enough to have been on @entity3 in college )
but you 'll be able to curate your own timeline
you can remove photos or posts you do n't want on it and resize images to emphasize ( or de-emphasize ) chapters of your life
at the end of the day , there will be nothing there that 's not already available to prying eyes -- but the eyes just wo n't have to pry as hard
verdict : mostly false 4
@entity3 monitors my activity when i 'm not logged in this one is n't directly linked to the changes , but has cropped up as they 're about to roll out
and , in truth , as more off - site sharing is introduced , it could become more prevalent
earlier this week , an @entity188 blogger posted data that he said shows information being sent to @entity3 by users even when they 're not logged into the site
@entity3 acknowledges that it uses " cookies " when you visit the site that then transmit data from other sites that are connected to it
@entity3 engineering director @entity200 told the @entity201 that the system is used to prevent phishing attacks and spam and to make it easier for users to log in on the sites they 've connected to the social network
@entity3 deletes the data immediately , he said , and it 's never used to target advertising or the like
" the onus is on us is to take all the data and scrub it , " @entity200 told the @entity201
" what really matters is what we say as a company and back it up
" verdict : true ( but in a limited way ) 5
i ca n't use @entity220 unless it 's linked to @entity3 this one depends : are you already on @entity220 ? if so , you 're in the clear
if not , or if you already signed up through your @entity3 account , the two services are pretty much married , ' til digital death do they part
to @entity220 , the emerging music - streaming service , and @entity3 , it 's a seamless and convenient way to listen to music and share songs with your friends
to people who might want to listen privately , or those elusive few who do n't have @entity3 accounts , it 's a hassle
users will still be able to use their @entity220 settings to control what information gets sent to @entity3 , though
so do n't worry -- if you 're secretly listening to lots of @entity241 and @entity242 on @entity220 , you can still do it on the down - low
verdict : true ( if you did n't already sign up )
