-- for most @entity2 , mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps
but in other parts of the world , mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year
mosquitoes , especially those in @entity14 , may transmit malaria to humans
a new malaria vaccine that 's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoes -- a whole lot of them
bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment , letting them feed on malaria - infected blood , irradiating the bugs , extracting the disease - causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines
the announcement of the @entity34 's approval for clinical trials comes just days before @entity36 , which is saturday
check out the @entity38 's site about malaria goals worldwide the vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it , said dr. @entity45 , chief executive and scientific officer at @entity47 , the @entity48 - based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine
this technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s , but the technology did n't exist to mass - produce it for the millions of people who need it , said dr. @entity55 , principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the @entity57
at that time , people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes
" that is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection , " said @entity62 , chair of @entity63 at the @entity64 , who is not involved with the @entity67 trials
the vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio
in those vaccines against viruses , weakened bacteria is injected , creating an immune response without causing illness
in the @entity84 vaccine , the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material , @entity55 said
it goes to the liver , where a lot of the immune response is generated , but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated , she said
clinical trials will begin in may , @entity45 said , and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls
about 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials , he said
if these trials are successful , researchers will initiate trials on adults in @entity14 , and then children
among other vaccines in clinical trials currently , the one that is furthest along is @entity107 , @entity108 , developed by @entity109 the company announced in december that this vaccine , based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite , was safely administered to @entity116 infants , with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three - month follow - up
both the @entity67 and the @entity109 projects receive support from the @entity121 , a program at the nonprofit @entity121 established through an initial grant from the @entity124
dame , who used to be involved with the @entity109 vaccine , said he would guess the @entity84 vaccine will be more effective , but clinical trials will provide more information
he also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure , and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts
each year , 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide , according to the @entity135
most people who die from the disease are young children in @entity14 south of the @entity138
symptoms of malaria include fever , chills and flu - like illness , the @entity135 said
although preventive measures exist , such as insecticide - treated nets and medications , there is no licensed vaccine on the market
moreover , effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries
the parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments , @entity55 said
" individuals living on $ 1 or $ 2 a day ca n't even afford $ 8 medication , " @entity55 said
the @entity2 military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine
the antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches , said dr. @entity164 , director of the @entity166 component of the @entity2 military malaria vaccine program , who provides oversight to the clinical trials
" malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas , " @entity164 said
the disease was the leading cause of casualties in the @entity179 during @entity180 , and also a major problem in the @entity182 , he said
there are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans
one called plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases
@entity171 was eliminated in the @entity2 in 1951 , but there are still cases in the country , mostly from people who acquired it in high - risk countries
in 2002 , there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the @entity2 , and all but five had been acquired abroad
an international team at the @entity200 recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk
researchers told @entity0 the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world
@entity45 , former head of a @entity166 malaria vaccine team , started the @entity84 effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003
the company now has a more official corporate headquarters in @entity217 , @entity48
" i thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine , there was no question this was the best way to make one , " he said .
