-- " @entity1 enjoys a far higher degree of press freedom than before the handover in 1997 and this is on par with the most developed places in the world , " said @entity1 secretary for home affairs , @entity9 , to the @entity10 last november
@entity9 was urging council members to vote down a motion defending press freedom in the territory , put forth by the @entity16 's @entity15 amid growing concern about @entity19 's influence on @entity1 's media
in fact , he sounded like a mainland official citing instances of ' good deeds ' when rebutting criticism against @entity19 's human rights record
such claims contrast sharply with the reality in @entity1 , where the free flow and access to information has been gradually but steadily restricted following @entity1 's return to @entity19 sovereignty on july 1 , 1997
although freedom of the press is enshrined in @entity1 's de facto constitution , the @entity37 , the gap has been shrinking between our city and mainland @entity19 , which does not enjoy freedom of expression
@entity1 - is it still special 15 years later ? in @entity1 , the proliferation of media outlets does not tell the whole story
the figures are robust : a city of seven million people consuming 46 daily newspapers and 642 periodicals as of 2010 , according to the @entity51
nonetheless , the large number of media outlets does not ensure a diversity of voices , which is a fundamental part of press freedom
according to an industry survey conducted by the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) in april , nearly 87 % of the 663 journalists who responded said press freedom in @entity1 has deteriorated since 2005 when @entity9 took office as chief executive
this builds upon a similar survey conducted by the @entity58 in 2007 , in which 58.4 % of journalists felt press freedom had been eroded since the 1997 handover
the results confirmed a worrying trend in the media industry
more than 92 % of respondents in this latest survey found the government 's tight grip on the flow of information has now surpassed self - censorship as the main mode of eroding press freedom
in many ways , the government now controls what information can be reported , and which images and soundbites can be used
the media have been blocked from many coverage opportunities and forced to rely more on official press materials
the government has increasingly resorted to holding press briefings , where information presented there may be attributed only to " anonymous " government sources
in one recent example , a population policy report was presented at a @entity96 lunch by chief secretary @entity97
a closed - door briefing was held , during which no audio or video recording was allowed
the full report was also not provided to the media , who were told to find it on the government 's website
the tightening of information sources by the government has more significance in @entity1 than elsewhere because there is not a multi-party system in place
the governing party is the only source of official information , and it allows only manipulated information to trickle out into the public domain
more worrying are the reports of rough treatment being meted out to reporters on the ground
at the july 1 march last year -- an annual display of public wrath against the destruction of democracy -- at least 19 frontline reporters were pepper - sprayed and one was unreasonably arrested
in august , media access to a three - day visit by @entity19 vice-premier @entity131 was mostly denied , with the press area located far away from the official ceremony
there are also tight restrictions on movement in the vicinity of the new government offices in @entity139 , making it impossible to freely conduct interviews
but what is more damaging for press freedom is the increased self - censorship among journalists
in the @entity58 survey conducted in april , 79.2 % of respondents said self - censorship now is more serious than at the start of @entity9 's term in 2005
many observers in @entity1 claim @entity153 's liaison office made tremendous efforts to help the new chief - executive leung chun - ying win his position in the april elections
three days before the vote , the @entity159 newspaper distorted the opinion column of veteran commentator , @entity163 , to support @entity165 's candidacy
@entity163 had rejected both candidates in his piece , which was altered without his consent to , " out of the two , i would rather choose @entity155
" sing @entity173 's editor - in - chief , @entity172 , admitted the alteration was made to conform with front - page coverage supporting @entity165
nonetheless , @entity163 's column was dropped completely from the paper shortly afterward , following a piece on the passing of mainland dissident @entity180 in @entity182 exile
the structural factors of journalistic self - censorship are reinforced when @entity1 media outlets are owned by listed companies that have an eye on mainland @entity19 's enormous market
over half of their owners and major stakeholders are appointed as delegates to the @entity194 or members of the @entity196
this conflict of interest leads to unfavorable coverage of the @entity19 government being cut
criticism of conglomerates that wield strong influence over advertising , and news detrimental to media owners ' interests are downplayed
last month , the english - language @entity209 's reduction of a 25 - cm - long story to a mere 100 - word brief on the questionable death of mainland dissident @entity214 on the day the story broke aroused allegations of self - censorship from both its employees and the media industry
the newly - promoted editor - in - chief , @entity220 , who is a member of the @entity221 , provided a weak defence in an official statement , arguing that he " chose not to prioritize coverage on the first day it broke until more facts and details surrounding the circumstances of this case could be established
" the @entity209 only gave wider coverage to the incident after the local @entity19 media gave it extensive coverage , and 25,000 people took to the streets to demand a thorough investigation into @entity131 's death
it seems the newspaper does not want be seen as lagging behind the ethos of @entity1
read about @entity1 's mass protest on july 1 press freedom in @entity1 is endangered and while efforts should start from us journalists , we need a collective effort to turn the tide
this latest controversy shows that mass social pressure may be an effective way to ward off self - censorship
the @entity19 authorities could not immediately be reached for comment
