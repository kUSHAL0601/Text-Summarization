when you 're a patient , you trust you 're in good hands , but even the best doctor or nurse can make a mistake on you or someone you love
" mistakes are happening every day in every hospital in the country that we 're just not catching , " says dr. @entity6 , an internist at @entity7
medical errors kill more than a quarter million people every year in the @entity14 and injure millions
add them all up and " you have probably the third leading cause of death " in the country , says dr. @entity20 , an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at @entity7
the harm is often avoidable , and there are strategies you can use to help doctors and nurses get things right
here 's a list of 10 shocking medical mistakes and ways to not become a victim : 1
mistake : treating the wrong patient cause : hospital staff fails to verify a patient 's identity
consequences : patients with similar names are confused
prevention : before every procedure in the hospital , make sure the staff checks your entire name , date of birth and barcode on your wrist band
example case : @entity49 2
mistake : surgical souvenirs cause : surgical staff miscounts ( or fails to count ) equipment used inside a patient during an operation
consequences : tools get left inside the body
prevention : if you have unexpected pain , fever or swelling after surgery , ask if you might have a surgical instrument inside you
example case : @entity64 3
mistake : lost patients cause : patients with dementia are sometimes prone to wandering
consequences : patients may become trapped while wandering and die from hypothermia or dehydration
prevention : if your loved one sometimes wanders , consider a gps tracking bracelet
example case : @entity76 4
mistake : fake doctors cause : con artists pretend to be doctors
consequences : medical treatments backfire
instead of getting better , patients get sicker
prevention : confirm online that your physician is licensed
example case : @entity86 5
mistake : the @entity88 waiting game cause : emergency rooms get backed up when overcrowded hospitals do n't have enough beds
consequences : patients get sicker while waiting for care
prevention : doctors listen to other doctors , so on your way to the hospital call your physician and ask them to call the emergency room
example case : @entity103 6
mistake : @entity104 bubbles in blood cause : the hole in a patient 's chest is n't sealed airtight after a chest tube is removed
consequences : air bubbles get sucked into the wound and cut off blood supply to the patient 's lungs , heart , kidneys and brain
@entity119 uncorrected the patient dies
prevention : if you have a central line tube in you , ask how you should be positioned when the line comes out
mistake : operating on the wrong body part cause : a patient 's chart is incorrect , or a surgeon misreads it , or surgical draping obscures marks that denote the correct side of the operation
consequences : the surgeon cuts into the wrong side of a patient 's body
prevention : just before surgery , make sure you reaffirm with the nurse and the surgeon the correct body part and side of your operation
mistake : infection infestation cause : doctors and nurses do n't wash their hands
consequences : patients can die from infections spread by hospital workers
prevention : it may be uncomfortable to ask , but make sure doctors and nurses wash their hands before they touch you , even if they 're wearing gloves
example case : @entity161 9
mistake : lookalike tubes cause : a chest tube and a feeding tube can look a lot alike
consequences : medicine meant for the stomach goes into the chest
prevention : when you have tubes in you , ask the staff to trace every tube back to the point of origin so the right medicine goes to the right place
example case : @entity179 10
mistake : waking up during surgery cause : an under - dose of anesthesia
consequences : the brain stays awake while the muscles stay frozen
most patients are n't in any pain but some feel every poke , prod and cut
prevention : when you schedule surgery , ask your surgeon if you need to be put asleep or if a local anesthetic might work just as well
