-- in what must be the most extraordinary statement of his presidency , @entity1 on monday blasted the possibility that the @entity6 might overturn the @entity7
@entity1 said the court would take an " unprecedented , extraordinary step " if it overturns the law , because it was passed by " a strong majority of a democratically elected @entity11
" setting aside the point that the @entity7 did not pass with an overwhelming majority , but by a party - line vote in the @entity18 and seven votes in the @entity20 , and without the support of a single member of the @entity23 , the most astonishing thing about @entity1 's diatribe was the fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional tradition it revealed
since 1788 , in the famous defense of the @entity29 set forth by @entity30 in the @entity31 , it has been understood that it is the task of the @entity6 to rein in majoritarian legislatures when they go beyond what the @entity29 permits
this is not , as @entity1 implies , judicial activism , or political activity on the part of the justices
this is simply , as @entity30 explained , fidelity to the @entity29 itself , fidelity to the highest expression of " @entity48 , " the body whose representatives ratified that @entity29
that doctrine of judicial review was most famously expressed by the great chief justice @entity51 in @entity52 ( 1803 ) , but it had been noted not only by @entity30 , but by many other federal judges in the late 18th century
and over the years , in more than 50 instances , courts have struck down unconstitutional behavior by the federal and state legislatures
judicial review is not usurpation -- it is the manner in which the rule of law is preserved in this nation
it is certainly true that sometimes courts , and even the @entity6 , have erred in their interpretation of the @entity29 , and some legislative acts that clearly were permitted by the @entity29 have been struck down
but if the @entity7 's individual mandate is rejected , this will be fully within the legitimate exercise of judicial powers
opinion : @entity6 is playing with fire this is because , as was made clear in the recent arguments in the court , that mandate , for the very first time in history , is an attempt to compel virtually every adult @entity80 to participate in commerce
it is not an attempt to regulate commerce -- which the @entity29 permits -- but is , instead , an attempt to create and compel commerce , which the @entity29 does not authorize
the @entity87 to the @entity29 , a measure regarded as fundamental by those who argued for the passage of the @entity91 in 1791 , provides that the powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states and the people thereof
as the @entity6 told us in the @entity98 ( 1995 ) and @entity99 ( 2000 ) cases , this means that there must be some limits on the powers of the federal government , and it also means that the basic law - making power , the police power , must reside in the governments closest to the people themselves , the state and local governments
this is our tradition , and the @entity7 's individual mandate is a fundamental break with that tradition
if , as it should , the @entity6 declares the individual mandate unconstitutional , it will be reaffirming our traditions , and not usurping them
the president , a former constitutional law teacher , should be ashamed of himself
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity123 .
