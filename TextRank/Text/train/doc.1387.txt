@entity0 -- a @entity6 - born @entity5 cleric and his son are exploring the possibility of legal action after they said they were prevented from traveling aboard an @entity13 flight from @entity0 to @entity14 , @entity15 , their attorney says
@entity16 and his son , @entity17 , were heading on friday to an annual conference on @entity19
they are the second pair of imams barred , at least initially , from traveling to the conference that day
also friday , @entity24 and @entity25 -- both clad in @entity5 attire -- were told to leave the aircraft as it was taxiing toward the runway
all four are represented by attorney @entity31 , who said that none of them had done anything out of the ordinary , nor were they praying or chanting
@entity31 said the elder @entity16 and his son have reached out to @entity13 for " accountability of the embarrassment and humiliation " that they said they endured
" imams have rights , " said @entity31
" they know they have rights
and they will hold these entities accountable if that 's what it comes to
" he added that the incident was unlawful and is " unequivocally a civil rights issue
" @entity13 responded in a written statement , saying " there was no ill intent on the part of any of our employees involved in this
" " it was a situation that just got very complicated very quickly
because we do n't discuss security matters , you may wish to talk with @entity65
" a spokeswoman for the @entity65 said " this passenger ( @entity67 ) was properly screened by @entity65 and cleared to fly
" " @entity65 did not deny the passenger boarding , " said spokeswoman @entity68
according to the pair 's attorney , the younger @entity16 was initially permitted to board the plane
but his father was instructed to meet with a gate agent to book a separate flight
shortly thereafter , federal agents then boarded the @entity13 plane and removed the younger @entity16 as well
neither man was given an explanation , their attorney says
the younger @entity16 was permitted on the following day to fly to @entity14
his father , however , was again denied and was compelled to drive instead
according to an @entity13 statement , an airline has the legal authority to refuse transport to an individual it deems unsafe , but airlines can not by law refuse transport based solely on a person 's race , color , national origin , religion , ethnicity or sex
" ultimately , the airline must be able to establish that the pilot 's determination to refuse to transport an individual was not arbitrary or capricious in order for the airline to fulfill its obligations under the statute , " said @entity13 spokesman @entity97
the incident has sparked controversy
" that kind of hype and hysteria reflect what 's worst about our country , " said @entity108 , board president of the @entity109 - @entity0
@entity116 points to last week 's killing of @entity119 terrorist leader @entity118 as a reason for what he calls " an uptick " in racial profiling against @entity124
" there has been a spike , " @entity108 said
" even in grade schools , we 've seen more bullying
" the news comes as @entity0 and others around the country tune in to media coverage of heightened security measures in the wake of @entity118 's death .
