-- the delivery is n't the smoothest , the guns are obviously fake and some of the language has been changed to avoid offending young ears
and the death scene -- well , it 's one of the most comical since @entity11 's big bounce at the beginning of " meet @entity13
" " ca n't you stop staying fudge all the time , @entity19 ? " a tiny and angry @entity14 says to pint - sized @entity16 druglord @entity15
" you do coke and you kill people
that 's wonderful , @entity19 ... i 'm leaving you , mother - fudger ! " yes , it 's " @entity28 , " but not director @entity26 's remake of the 1932 gangster film
and the diminutive actors are children -- elementary - age children
they 're appearing in one of the hottest current viral videos , " @entity28 : the @entity32
" watch the video but it 's not really a school play , says producer @entity36 of @entity37
it 's just a video aimed at illustrating the pervasiveness of sex and violence in our media culture -- and how it blankets children on a daily basis
@entity36 , a commercial and music video director , says his first love is viral videos
" i love the aesthetics , and it 's a brand new avenue of expression for filmmakers to express themselves freely , " says @entity36 , whose previous video statements include " @entity50 " for @entity51 , featuring a group of people invading a clothing store in gold lame " @entity56 pants " -- a la @entity56 , circa 1989 -- and dancing , much to the surprise of shoppers
ok , but @entity28 ? with children ? " it 's the most in comedy and satire and opposite attracts , " he said
" what is the most opposite film there is to children ? it 's @entity28
" with two young children , @entity36 said the issue of what is and is n't permissible in media content is a key issue
the @entity28 video , he said , might launch a dialog
" what 's interesting to me and my wife is that the video is shocking , yet everyday , we have to guard what our children view from television commercials or video game violence , " he said
" so , it 's interesting to me on a lot of levels and it 's creating that debate
" the children in the video are between the ages of 7 and 10 , @entity36 said
he collaborated with a @entity99 , @entity100 , casting director , with whom he 's worked on several projects , to find talented children for the video
the children 's parents , he said , have not complained about the content , but then again , the casting was in @entity109 , where " we 're asked to do all sorts of things
" " obviously there are people who find it outrageous and provocative , but there are a lot of parents , who are like me and my wife , who see all the violence on television and all the different things that are sold to children and that 's a thousand times worse than this video
