@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new type of walk - through security machine will debut at several @entity6 airports in the coming days as the @entity7 tries out the latest in body scanning technology
privacy experts with the @entity10 are concerned the walk - through scanning machine is too invasive
it 's called " millimeter - wave passenger imaging technology , " and it produces a more detailed picture than the metal detectors in use now at airports to screen for weapons and explosives
. because it produces such a detailed image , however , technology and privacy experts at the @entity10 are not satisfied that the new technology meets privacy standards
in a written statement issued thursday , @entity27 of the @entity10 said the technology can pick up graphic body images and even medical details like whether a passenger has a colostomy bag
@entity27 called the screening an " assault on the essential dignity of passengers that citizens in a free nation should not have to tolerate
" @entity7 spokeswoman @entity40 said privacy will be respected with the new millimeter - wave technique
" we want to preserve passengers ' privacy and make them feel comfortable with trying a technology like this , " she said
a @entity7 officer will escort a passenger to the machine for the test , but the person looking at the actual body scans will be at a different location and will not see the passenger , the @entity7 said
in addition , the scans will have a " modesty filter " to blur out faces , and no images will be saved
but the @entity10 expressed concern that @entity7 officers would not be able to resist the temptation to save images of certain people , such as celebrities , and that the plan to blur faces might later be changed
this is how the new scanners work
the passenger steps into a machine where he or she is quickly scanned with radio waves
those waves reflect off the body to transmit a three - dimensional image of the passenger that looks like a fuzzy photo negative
a @entity7 officer studies the image on a screen and looks for unusual shapes that might mean a passenger is carrying something suspicious
passengers who are asked to undergo a second screening can choose a pat - down search or the millimeter - wave test
the @entity7 says the machines scan a passenger twice , each scan taking less than two seconds
but it takes another minute or two for a screener to review the scans before signaling a passenger to move on
the @entity7 demonstrated the screening technology at a news conference wednesday near @entity99
@entity100 said the millimeter wave is harmless and " can see more than a magnetometer , " which is the first screening machine airport passengers encounter
" a magnetometer only picks up metal or weapons , so this could see other materials that might be hidden on the body and it also produces an image " rather than just a beep , she said
asked if the millimeter wave could detect an object hidden in a body cavity , she said only that the @entity7 will learn more about the technology as it 's tested at @entity6 airports
the @entity7 has been testing another type of imaging technology called backscatter
this technology also came under some fire because it shows very detailed body images -- which led some critics to call it an electronic strip search
so , the backscatter was altered and blurred to show more of an outline of the body
the @entity7 will continue to test the backscatter scanners in some airports
@entity7 officials said they are a long way from deciding whether they 'll settle on just one of these imaging technologies
@entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , begins using the new machines thursday -- to be offered as an option for people who are asked to be screened a second time
@entity142 in @entity143 and @entity144 in @entity145 are also slated to try the machines @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and the @entity152 are using the millimeter wave screening
in the @entity6 , some courthouses and jails are trying it
