@entity0 , @entity1 -- already devastated this year by a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak , @entity1 felt the brute force friday of @entity6 , which could dump up to 15 inches of rain and trigger flash floods and mudslides
the hurricane 's punishing rain continued to pound @entity1 even as the storm churned away from @entity13
as of 8 p.m. et , the storm 's center was about 135 miles ( 220 kilometers ) east of @entity16 , @entity17 , and about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) south of @entity18 in the @entity19 , according to the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22
earlier friday , @entity23 had passed within about 140 miles ( 230 kilometers ) of @entity0
in the westernmost tip of @entity1 , which juts into the @entity26 and is closest to the hurricane , there were reports from the town of @entity30 of destroyed houses , downed trees and flooded rivers , said @entity34 , an emergency team leader with @entity35 in @entity1
also , he said , @entity35 workers near the coastal city of @entity38 reported the area has been inundated with several feet of water
downtown streets turned into rivers , said @entity34
@entity23 was also felt in @entity0 , the nation 's capital , but the worst of the storm appeared to have passed there after rain pounded the city overnight
by friday afternoon , rain had stopped falling
it started again in fits and spurts later
" we were expecting something perhaps a little larger , but it 's still quite significant , " @entity34 said about @entity6 , adding that rescue teams throughout @entity1 are still working to assess the damage
" in the capital so far , we 've been relatively lucky , all things considered
" the threat of ongoing rain remains real , as does the possibility of the spread of waterborne diseases , @entity34 said
relief worker @entity63 of @entity64 was near @entity65 , about 20 miles north of @entity0 , on friday morning , touring camps that hold some of the 1 million people left homeless by january 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake , which killed some 250,000 people
" it 's almost eerie , " she said
" it 's rainy , it 's dark and there 's really not a lot of movement
" the few people moving from tent to tent were wrapped in sheets and cloth to provide some protection against the constant rain , she said
the ground was soaked and some low - lying areas had minor flooding
some people rode out the storm in open - air community centers with supposedly sturdy roofs , she said
but many just huddled in their tents , waiting for the wind and rain to pass
@entity94 did n't have anywhere else to go
" a lot of them do not have families or relatives , " said @entity63
many structures that would usually be used for storm shelters -- schools and hospitals -- are no longer standing
she said her agency , an international @entity106 relief organization , evacuated 30 staff members from @entity38 out of fear of mudslides there
@entity111 , the director in @entity1 for the @entity112 , also expressed his deep concern friday
" particularly , " he told @entity2 , " with mudslides that can cut off whole communities
we have pre-positioned medical supplies , tents , tarps and staff in areas that we know will be isolated
" aid workers already were struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak , which has killed nearly 450 people and hospitalized about 7,000
the bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours
" it 's obviously stretched us all real thin , " @entity111 said
" we could certainly use more help ... as can all the other responders
" the hurricane will likely only make matters worse
" even if @entity6 only brushes @entity1 , it may exacerbate the epidemic , facilitating the spread of the disease into and throughout metropolitan @entity0 , where a third of the population remains homeless and in camps , " the @entity139 said
@entity23 became a category 1 hurricane as it approached @entity1 early friday , forecasters said
it was previously a category 2 hurricane and then weakened to a tropical depression before reintensifying
forecasters predict the storm could strengthen during the next 24 hours before weakening again saturday night and sunday
the biggest threats were mudslides and flash flooding , said @entity2 meteorologist @entity151
@entity0 is bounded on three sides by hills , and rain runoff could cause flooding , @entity151 said
the low - lying port city also borders the @entity26
winds from the storm had slowed to 75 mph ( 120 kph ) , the @entity20 said friday evening , adding that @entity6 was moving northeast at 14 mph ( 22 kph )
@entity159 was expected to pass near or over the southeastern @entity19 and the @entity160 and @entity161 friday night or early saturday
rain associated with the storm started falling on @entity1 on thursday as aid agencies scrambled to move as many people as possible into storm shelters
as it did after the earthquake , the @entity166 offered its assistance
the @entity169 had pre-positioned supplies , but rushed more into the country before the airport closed ahead of the storm , said @entity173 , acting director of the @entity174
citing @entity1 authorities , @entity173 said at a friday briefing for reporters that about half the residents at temporary camps left those facilities overnight to stay with family or friends
he said the @entity1 government has confirmed one fatality
in addition , the @entity185 redirected the @entity187 to @entity1 from @entity188 , where the ship 's crew was conducting a four - month humanitarian mission
in addition to search - and - rescue - trained helicopter crews , the ship is carrying more than 200 medical personnel and 60 @entity185 construction engineers who can help with recovery efforts
the ship is also carrying a 500 - member @entity200 task force and personnel from nongovernmental relief agencies
@entity204 , who participated in the @entity185 response to the earthquake , said he did not expect the fallout from @entity6 to be anywhere near as severe
" it 's everyone 's prayer here that our capabilities will not be required , " @entity204 said
" but everyone should be very confident that we are prepared if they are
" @entity2 's @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .
