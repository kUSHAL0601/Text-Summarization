-- president @entity1 on wednesday challenged @entity2 to " fight as hard for middle - class families as you do for those who are more fortunate , " telling a @entity6 crowd to push @entity7 to extend the payroll tax cut enacted a year ago
@entity1 met with a family in @entity10 , the birthplace of vice president @entity11 , then spoke at a nearby high school in what will be a battleground state in next year 's presidential election
sounding the populist themes of his re-election bid so far , @entity1 complained that congressional @entity2 were out of touch with mainstream @entity20 support for his jobs bill that included an extension of the payroll tax cut
he noted @entity24 @entity2 previously blocked debate on the plan , saying that " their actions lately do n't reflect who we are as a people
" a loud cheer erupted when @entity1 described the @entity33 proposal to extend and expand the reduced payroll tax rate by saying : " it is paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share
" noting the hard - line @entity2 opposition in deficit reduction negotiations to any tax increases for the wealthy , @entity1 urged the audience to ask its elected representatives " are you willing to fight as hard for middle - class families as you do for those who are more fortunate ? " " send your senators a message , " @entity1 said to cheers
" tell them do n't be a grinch
do n't be a grinch
do n't vote to raise taxes on working @entity20 during the holidays
" economists say the payroll tax cut -- part of a congressional spending deal negotiated last december -- has contributed to the nation 's economic recovery
congressional republicans have indicated support for extending the lower payroll tax rate for another year , but differ with @entity1 and @entity33 on covering the more than $ 200 billion price tag
a @entity33 bill under consideration by the @entity24 would assess a 3.25 % tax on income above $ 1 million a year to cover the cost
@entity2 reject any tax increases and offered their alternative later wednesday , calling for a freeze of federal salaries , reducing the federal workforce and preventing millionaires from getting food stamps and unemployment benefits
" republicans will put aside their misgivings and support this extension , not because we believe as the president does that another short - term stimulus will turn this economy around ... but because we know it will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue to need it nearly three years into this presidency , " @entity79 leader @entity79 of @entity80 said wednesday on the @entity24 floor
the @entity33 surtax would hit wealthy @entity20 who create jobs , @entity95 added , arguing such a strategy made no sense
the debate , he said , is about " whether we should help those who are struggling in a bad economy by punishing the private sector businesses that the @entity20 people are counting on to help turn this economy around
" the @entity106 pushed back against the @entity2 argument
spokesman @entity108 told reporters traveling with @entity1 to @entity6 that the @entity106 was open to @entity2 ideas on the legislation
at the same time , @entity108 noted that @entity2 have defended @entity113 - era tax cuts for millionaires but now raised questions about helping ease the tax burden of working - class @entity20
on tuesday , the new chairman of the @entity119 , @entity120 , told reporters that the proposed surtax on incomes above $ 1 million " would hit very few small businesses
" " the vast majority -- one figure i saw was 99 % of individuals with small business income -- would not be affected by this , " @entity120 said
according to the non-partisan @entity130 , 121 million families have benefited from the payroll tax break , with an increase in take - home pay of $ 934 for the average worker
@entity135 estimated in august that letting the tax cut expire would reduce growth by as much as 0.5 %
it called extending the cut one of the " most straightforward " ways to " reduce some of the coming fiscal restraint
" the @entity33 ' bill would extend and expand last year 's tax break
payroll taxes , cut to 4.2 % from 6.2 % last year , would be lowered to 3.1 % to provide middle class families with up to $ 1,500 more in their paychecks next year , @entity33 said
their measure also would partially extend the break to employers , hoping that might spur hiring
the price tag of the bill is about $ 265 billion , paid for by the 3.25 % surtax on annual income above $ 1 million , according to @entity33 aides
senate democratic leader @entity158 of @entity159 noted tuesday that polls show a majority of @entity2 voters think wealthy @entity20 should pay more in taxes
" the only place in @entity20 that people do n't want a fair system is @entity2 here in the @entity24 , " @entity158 said
by contrast , the @entity2 plan would continue the 4.2 % payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three - year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal workforce by 10 % through replacing workers when they quit or retire
in addition , the plan would require @entity20 earning $ 750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for @entity178 , and also prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation
according to a @entity2 aide , the non-partisan @entity182 found that the @entity178 , food stamp and unemployment provisions would save $ 9 billion over 10 years , mostly from the @entity178 part
a statement by @entity158 spokesman @entity188 said the @entity2 plan would never pass i the @entity190 - controlled @entity24 , " but now that @entity2 have reversed their position on the middle - class tax cut , we look forward to working with them to negotiate a consensus solution
" @entity1 's trip wednesday was his 17th to @entity6 since taking office
@entity1 won the state by a 10 - point margin in 2008 , but @entity6 is seen as largely in play in the 2012 contest
a @entity202 poll taken in early november indicated @entity1 ahead of potential @entity2 rivals in @entity6 in hypothetical 2012 general election showdowns
however , many voters surveyed said they had n't yet made up their mind about whom to support in the presidential election
@entity210 's @entity209 and @entity0 's @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .
