@entity0 , @entity1 -- the tug - of - war between the two men who claim the presidency of the @entity1 intensified wednesday
@entity6 , who was picked by @entity7 to be prime minister in his government , said on wednesday that the international community should use force to remove incumbent president @entity12 from power
the country 's @entity14 said @entity7 won a november 28 runoff election , but its @entity17 invalidated those results and declared @entity12 the winner
the @entity20 , the @entity21 and other international and regional bodies recognize @entity7 as the victor , but @entity12 has declined to step down
a @entity20 credentialing commission added pressure by approving on wednesday a diplomatic maneuver that would further isolate the government of @entity12
the commission agreed to back a new ambassador to the body appointed by @entity7
@entity32 spokesman @entity31 on wednesday said that the @entity33 and other countries were discussing with @entity36 nations the possibility of augmenting the existing @entity20 force in the @entity1
however , he said it was unclear what a @entity33 contribution could look like , whether it be forces of logistical support or something more indirect
right now , these are just ideas , @entity31 said
the @entity46 on wednesday said it has halted lending and disbursing funds to the @entity1 and that the agency 's office in the @entity36 country has been closed
the agency said it and the @entity53 have backed the @entity21 and the @entity54 " in sending the message to @entity12 that he lost the elections and he needs to step down
" " a peaceful and rapid resolution is critical " for @entity59 and the region , the bank said
meanwhile , @entity61 has become the latest @entity63 country to warn its citizens of danger in the @entity1
@entity67 citizens in the @entity36 nation should leave if possible , a government spokesman , @entity69 , said wednesday
the @entity33 and @entity70 also have warned their citizens of possible violence in the @entity1 , where up to 50 people are said to have been killed amid a political stalemate after a disputed presidential election
the @entity32 ordered nonemergency personnel and family members this week to leave the country
it also warned @entity33 citizens against traveling to the @entity1 , a former @entity67 colony of about 19 million people
the @entity70 @entity81 also had advised @entity70 citizens to avoid travel to the @entity1 and , for those already there , to leave the country unless they " have a pressing reason to remain
" on tuesday , @entity20 @entity87 ban ki - moon warned that the country risks a return to civil war " in the past week , there has been an alarming increase in the use of intimidation by elements of the national security forces loyal to mr. @entity12 against the civilian population , and in particular against supporters of president - elect @entity7 , " he said
" the tactics include abductions and killings and the propagation of hate speech through the state broadcasting corporation , " he continued
" there is a real risk of a return to civil war
" @entity12 struck a defiant tone in a tuesday speech , declaring , " i am the president
" he stressed he is the legitimate winner of the election , but said he would be willing to welcome an international committee to review the results to avoid any further violence
" i do n't want any more bloodshed
i do n't want any more war , " he said
@entity20 peacekeeping chief @entity118 referred to @entity12 's remarks when he spoke to reporters in @entity121
" mr. @entity12 has been very clear
he wants no violence , no more blood , " @entity122 said
" so all the forces loyal to him should stop immediately provocation , instigating violence , violation of human rights and provoking " @entity20 peacekeepers in the country
@entity122 said @entity12 's allies have been handing out rifles to members of a " @entity136 " group , and mercenaries from @entity138 and @entity139 have been hired " to provoke " civilians and @entity20 peacekeepers
@entity142 , citing eyewitnesses , has said that it has heard an increasing number of stories of people arrested or otherwise taken by gunmen , often with the cooperation of security forces
" it is clear that more and more people are being illegally detained by security forces or armed militiamen , and we fear that many of them may have been killed or have disappeared , " @entity149 , @entity142 's @entity36 researcher , said in a written statement
the @entity158 has extended its peacekeepers ' mission in @entity1 through june 30 , despite an expulsion order by @entity12
the @entity12 government accuses the @entity20 of providing military and logistical support to former rebels who are backers of @entity7 -- a charge @entity166 denied
@entity2 's @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .
