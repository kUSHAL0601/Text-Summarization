@entity0 -- tuesday was the first day same - sex weddings could be performed in the @entity3
last week , @entity3 was added to the list of those few states that permit gay marriage
a law passed in december and signed by the mayor went into effect when @entity10 ( which has the power to reject @entity3 laws ) refrained from interfering
likewise , chief justice @entity13 refused an application to the @entity16 @entity15 to block the gay marriage law from going into effect , on procedural grounds , saying that the legal challenge was premature
this should not be viewed as a ringing endorsement from the high court for gay marriage or for protecting the privacy rights of gay people
only two months ago , in january , the @entity15 was not so hands - off in gay - marriage - related cases
twice , the court intervened in cases in which active opponents of gay marriage , in @entity33 and @entity0 , have claimed that their right to privacy will be invaded if they are not given legal protection to be unseen and anonymous
in the @entity33 case , the high court ruled to prevent the broadcast of videotaped trial testimony of the organizers of @entity42 , which bans same - sex marriage
in the @entity0 case , which the court agreed to hear in full this year , the issue is whether the names on public petitions can be sealed
more than 130,000 signatures had been gathered by gay - marriage opponents in that case as part of an effort to place a referendum on the ballot to overturn a state domestic partnership law
to those of us who strongly favor equal marriage rights -- and who have a personal stake in them -- providing cover to those who would keep those rights from us feels a little like a drive - by assault : we had a glance at the people attacking us , but now they are gone , not to be identified
another privacy interest is at stake in the gay marriage cases , and it will be interesting to see whether the @entity15 embraces it with the same zeal demonstrated with respect to opponents of gay marriage
this month , now that the @entity3 gay marriage law has gone into effect , my domestic partner of more than 12 years and i will wed. with our marriage will come a bundle of rights , making us equal under the law to our heterosexual peers
more fundamentally , we will be able to have our loving commitment to each other officially recognized , like any other committed couple
and in terms of personal privacy , no longer will i have to indicate my sexual orientation to anyone who asks me whether i am married , as i can thereafter simply answer " yes " rather than explain that i have a " domestic partner , " the well - understood code that one is in a gay relationship
the marriage license the @entity97 is providing us will include the right to privacy in our relationship
i am not closeted , but it is part of my right to privacy to choose with whom i share the information about my sexual orientation
indeed , that is what the @entity33 @entity15 ruled in declaring equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians
that decision was what led to @entity42 and the invalidation of the court 's ruling and , now , the equal protection lawsuit on trial in federal court in @entity119 to overturn the @entity42 ban
in its original ruling , the @entity33 court adopted an argument advanced in a brief filed by the @entity125 that i helped to write
the @entity16 @entity15 has found that opponents of gay marriage who supported @entity42 -- and whose testimony will be offered in @entity119 trial to show a discriminatory animus relevant to the equal protection issue -- are entitled under their right to privacy not to have their testimony videotaped for public viewing
the @entity15 cited the potential harassment of the witnesses if their testimony is shown
the harassment argument also is being made about the signers of the petition in @entity0 on gay marriage , who claim the right to have their names removed from public view
( that case admittedly , is more complicated , as petition signing has attributes of voting , where one 's vote is private
) the difference in the privacy rights afforded gay couples and those who worked to ban gay marriage is obvious
the opponents are people who chose to involve themselves in a public debate , to enter the public square
indeed , my domestic partner and i were stopped at an intersection in @entity165 in the run - up to @entity42 and were bombarded with placard - waiving , proposition 8 - supporting protesters , their signs condemning gay people as deviants
( those are the kind of folks i would rather simply inform , if asked , that i am married rather than in a " domestic partnership " and thus avoid their scorn and preserve my privacy , defined by justice @entity179 as the " right to be let alone
" ) gay couples , on the other hand , did not choose to be gay or have society prevent them from enjoying equal marriage rights , forcing them to self - identify when they are asked whether they are married
as a litigator , i know that televising a trial can indeed create a circus atmosphere if it is not carefully controlled
on the other hand , filtering what goes on in a courtroom through the printed word only deprives people of the opportunity to see what really goes on -- to judge demeanor and motive , which will be especially important in understanding the testimony of the @entity42 supporters
the judge in the trial of @entity42 appeared to strike a balance , to avoid a circus , by allowing only delayed videotape access to coverage of the trial
in the first privacy ruling in the @entity33 gay marriage case , the @entity15 declared itself in favor of privacy for opponents of gay marriage
when the case comes back to it on the merits , as it surely will , let 's hope that other privacy issue , as well as the equal protection issue , finds similar support
in the meantime , my domestic partner and i each look forward this spring to answering the question " are you married ? " with a simple " yes
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .
