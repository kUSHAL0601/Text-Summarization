-- @entity4 's king is giving up most of the near - absolute power that his family has held for centuries in the @entity9 nation , the country 's news agency reported monday
the royal dynasty currently headed by @entity11 was founded in 1845
@entity11 will let the prime minister guide the day - to - day governmental affairs , @entity12 reported
he will continue to hold on to judicial powers , including the ability to appoint judges and commute prison sentences
@entity19 , 60 , announced his plans as the country prepares a days - long coronation ceremony that begins friday
the decision , he said , is meant to prepare the country for parliamentary elections in 2010
@entity4 , with a population of 119,000 , is the only monarchy that remains in the @entity9
currently , the king appoints the prime minister and 12 to 14 cabinet ministers
noble families choose nine others
" ( @entity35 ) is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people , " the news agency said
" they see @entity4 's royal heritage as integral to the country 's culture and identity , but favour a more representative , elected @entity46
the king agrees with them
" @entity4 has for years promised to pave the way toward a democratically elected parliament , but reforms have been slow in coming
@entity19 ascended to the throne after the death of his father in september 2006 , and promised to speed up the changes
two months later , a pro-democracy rally in the capital city of @entity58 led to riots that left eight people dead and the central business district in ruins
closing a session of @entity46 a week later , the king said , " let us rebuild a new capital and a new @entity4
" the announcement , the news agency said , is part of that promise
already this year , two other countries saw the end of monarchy
in march , @entity74 held elections that ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the @entity78 nation and transformed it into a democracy
two months later , neighboring @entity81 declared itself a republic following the elections for a new @entity84 that abolished a 239 - year monarchy
@entity4 is an archipelago of 171 islands directly south of @entity87
less than a third of the islands are inhabited
the present dynasty was founded in 1845 after the @entity4 islands were first united .
