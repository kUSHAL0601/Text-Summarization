-- three young brothers from @entity2 remain missing despite the efforts of police and volunteer searchers working since the boys ' disappearance during the @entity9 holiday weekend
residents in the small city of @entity12 , @entity2 , held a candlelight vigil sunday night for @entity14 , 5 , @entity15 , 7 , and @entity16 , 9 , who were last seen at their father 's home on @entity9
the father , @entity19 , was arrested last tuesday upon his release from a mental health facility where he was being treated after a suicide attempt , according to @entity12 police chief @entity23
@entity15 -- charged with parental kidnapping -- is fighting his extradition from @entity27 , authorities said last week
a hearing is set for december 14
although investigators have found " a number of items , " they have not determined the children 's whereabouts , @entity23 has said
local authorities and federal investigators have been assisting with the search
@entity23 has said authorities are skeptical of the information @entity15 has provided
@entity15 said he left the three boys with a woman , whom he identified as @entity40 , the morning before he tried to take his own life -- in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide attempt
@entity15 said @entity40 was supposed to take the boys to their home in @entity12 , a southern @entity2 town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west - northwest of @entity48 , @entity27 , on november 26 , @entity23 said
but the boys never arrived
earlier , authorities determined that @entity15 had no " established relationship " with the person he named as @entity40 , and they are n't certain she even exists
authorities have been asking for the public 's help , hoping someone saw @entity15 's blue 2000 @entity57 that was believed to be carrying the boys along a 25 - mile stretch of road between @entity12 and @entity61 , @entity27
the last time someone other than a family member saw the boys was at 5 p.m. on november 25 , according to weeks
police say @entity14 is 3 feet , 6 inches tall , has strawberry - blond hair and blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds
@entity15 is 3 feet , 9 inches tall , has brown hair and eyes , weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin
the oldest brother , @entity74 , is 4 feet , 1 inches tall , has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds .
