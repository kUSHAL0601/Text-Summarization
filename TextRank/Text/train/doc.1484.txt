-- @entity1 is not afraid of reinvention
while other boy - band heartthrobs were still recycling the same hooks , the multitalented 30 - year - old had moved on to a solo @entity7 career , fighting his own label to do non-bubblegum songs like " @entity10
" now , @entity1 has decided to let his grammys collect dust while he makes yet another leap : pop star to movie star
" @entity20 , " opening today , marks the first time @entity1 's name has seen the top of a cast list
and it wo n't be the last
what 's the secret to @entity1 's crossover success ? no doubt he 's talented , hard - working and easy on the eyes
but there 's something else at play here , something rarely acknowledged in articles about @entity1 's stylish clothes and beautiful girlfriends : @entity1 is a nerd
that 's not to say he is n't cool
he 's the cool nerd , the guy who makes cool seem attainable
remember that popular guy in high school who was n't a quarterback or homecoming king , whose sheer likability gave him a spot at the cool kids ' table ? @entity1 is n't so far removed from that kid
take a look at " @entity48 , " the facebook - origin movie that put @entity1 , @entity50 , on the map
@entity1 plays @entity53 founder @entity52 , the closest thing the film has to a rock star
when he saunters into a @entity59 restaurant , heads swivel
as @entity52 , @entity1 is charismatic and convincing , but what makes his performance great is a deep , intense vulnerability
@entity52 , we realize , is only a celebrity in the insular tech world ; in the real world , he 's just an asthmatic college dropout
he 's a person who has carefully crafted his own hyper - cool image , an impersonation of what he thinks a tech - world celebrity ( had there ever been such a thing before ? ) should be
at the end of the film , the cracks start to show , and our hearts break a little
perhaps @entity1 played @entity52 so well because he , too , is a guy who has carefully curated his own image
try to isolate him for a moment from his hit songs , his " snl " skits , his movie trailers
would you cast a guy like @entity1 -- the puppy - dog screen presence , the high breathy voice , the @entity88 pad of hair -- as a leading man ? @entity1 knows he 's an unlikely candidate to fill @entity92 's shoes , which is why he 's played his acting career like a chess game : making under - the - radar indie films and popping up casually on " @entity97 " until he was suddenly on every movie screen
these days , @entity1 is frequently compared to @entity99 , another @entity100 teen idol who gave it up for a film career
but beyond the obvious , it 's not a good analogy
@entity99 was born a leading man , buff and intimidating with a sly smile and a natural swagger
when he became a movie star , he cut himself off completely from his now - embarrassing foray into rap
it 's now amusing to think of @entity99 and @entity99 as the same person , because the differences are so striking
@entity1 has a leading - man swagger , too -- but his seems carefully practiced , the way @entity116 would rehearse behind closed doors for hours to make his dancing seem effortless
his gestures , his jokes , appear as carefully chosen as his impeccable wardrobe
remember , this is the guy who became a decent facsimile of a young @entity126 through sheer hard work and force of will
unlike @entity99 , @entity1 has never tried to distance himself from his teenybopper days
he knows we 've all seen him as a 14 - year - old in blond dreadlocks and head - to - toe denim
and that , too , is part of his charm
he makes cool seem attainable for the rest of us geeks
when his @entity141 awkwardness shows through his @entity143 persona , he 's the first person to laugh it off
he 's not the guy you 'd expect to " have you naked by the end of this song , " as he sings in " @entity149 " -- and that 's why he pulls it off so well
all of this makes @entity1 the perfect star for a time when the line between geeky and cool has become more of a zigzag
like those @entity159 glasses he wears in interviews , @entity1 has found a way to be the best of both cultures
and two weeks ago , the teen - star - turned - pop - star - turned - film - star announced that he would be reinventing the social networking site @entity166
it 's life imitating art -- and of all people , @entity1 knows a little something about doing a great imitation .
