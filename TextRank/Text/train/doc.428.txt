-- fear is a terrible thing to waste
yet modern @entity3 have squandered it as a tool for managing burgeoning populations of wildlife
a woman is in the hospital after she was mauled by a bear while walking in her central @entity12 neighborhood on monday
authorities caught a 75 - to 100 - pound yearling , but think the larger predator bear is still on the prowl
@entity17 thinks black bears have a people problem
he 's a state wildlife biologist once responsible for dealing with growing bear - vs. - people conflicts in central @entity12
i spent time with @entity17 while researching the book " @entity23
" he explained that perpetually hungry black bears need plenty of food habitat
parents disown yearlings , forcing them to find new space
as their populations grow , they spread out , often from the @entity31 south into the swampy sprawl of @entity33
trouble starts when a bear turns up in a backyard
instead of scaring it away , too many people say : " oh , is n't he cute
let 's toss him a cookie
" thus begins a photo collection of " @entity45
" but it 's the beginning of the end for that bear , because the people are teaching it to associate the smell of people with food
the bear comes back for more
soon it 's breaking into the house
the people call 911 : " do something about your bear
" @entity17 arrives , darts the bear and moves it 100 miles
but the bear has learned people equals food , and does it again
after three strikes , the bear is shot -- euthanized
but it 's not the bear 's fault
it 's the people 's fault
deer are eating our gardens and spreading ticks that cause lyme disease ; coyotes are killing our pets ; turkeys are chasing our children to school ; and geese have overrun our soccer fields because they do n't fear us
and we have done all sorts of things to help them lose their natural fear
people say our conflicts with wild creatures are our fault because we encroached on their habitat
true , but only half the story
many species encroached right back
why ? because our habitat is better than theirs
ours can sustain many more of them than their un-peopled landscape
we put out all sorts of food for them : lawns , gardens , shrubbery , birdseed , grill grease , garbage , dumpster waste
we offer water : air - conditioner drip pans are water fountains for raccoons
edges and hiding places are homes : a coyote can have a litter of pups in that brush behind your garbage and you wo n't know it
and we offer protection from predators , mainly ourselves
the results are mounting in people - vs. - wildlife conflicts
we should be celebrating a conservation success story that is unique on the planet
instead , we demonize elegant creatures and fight over what to do , or not to do , about too much of a good thing
how did this happen ? how did we turn this story into such a mess ? in a nutshell : over the last century and half , forests grew back on abandoned farmland ; a century ago we ended commercial hunting and began restoring wild bird and animal populations
since @entity140 we sprawled out into suburbs and exurbs -- something early conservationists did n't imagine
the 2000 census showed that for the first time , an absolute majority of the population lived neither in cities nor on working farms but in the vast sprawl zone in between
that 's where family farms were a century ago
today , it 's full of trees and filling with wildlife
we 've become forest people -- yet we spend 90 % of our time indoors
there we get most of our nature on digital screens , where wild creatures are often portrayed as pets performing all sorts of antics
research suggests that the white - tailed deer 's biggest predator since the last @entity169 has been man
but sprawl man has largely gotten out of the predation business
he does n't hunt and does n't want others to hunt around him
he 's peppered the landscape with hunting restrictions and enacted all sorts of laws against hunting , firearms discharges , even bow - and - arrow use in some places
what this means is that in just the last few decades , for the first time in 11,000 years , huge swaths of the whitetail 's historic range -- the @entity186 -- have been put off - limits to its biggest predators
no wonder deer have burgeoned out of control
in @entity194 , for example , it 's illegal to discharge a firearm within 150 feet of a hard - surfaced road or within 500 feet of an occupied dwelling without the occupants ' written permission -- often not easy to get
those two laws alone put almost two - thirds of the state effectively off - limits to hunting
lots of states have similar restrictions and most were imposed in the name of safety
guns kill 31,500 people annually in the @entity186 , but hunters are relatively safe
estimates say about 100 people die in hunting accidents , mainly in cases of mistaken identity
these days , deer kill more than twice that many , both in deer - vehicle crashes and when drivers swerve into a tree or an oncoming vehicle
these accidents hospitalize another 30,000 people
do n't swerve : hit the deer
@entity227 white - tails , meanwhile , do enormous damage to the landscape , and not just gardens and shrubbery
they are ruining our forests by eating their understories so trees ca n't regenerate
no places for understory birds and the insects they feed their newborn
black bears are shy and docile creatures motivated by hunger and fear , but they , like deer , beavers , turkeys , waterfowl and others , were almost wiped out in the @entity186 by the end of the 19th century
@entity254 and @entity255 reportedly killed 155 of them in one season in @entity258
with protection , they slowly came back in the 20th century , to about 750,000 in 2002 and perhaps a million or more today
between 1900 and 2009 , black bears killed 63 people -- 86 % were in the last 40 years
why the increase ? more bears and more denatured people living in the same habitat
birdseed sellers now refer to wild birds as " outdoor pets , " helping to condition people to think that putting out food for wild animals is an act of kindness
@entity275 and no fear have turned many normally nocturnal wild creatures diurnal
they hang out among us in the daytime
nuisance wildlife control people say tossing rocks at coyotes would help reinstill their fear of people
instead , i 've known people to toss them dog biscuits
carrying a stick or a golf club is enough to deter wild turkeys , mail carriers tell me
@entity294 - proofing your garbage cans and taking down your birdfeeders in spring are no - brainers
conflicts between people and wild animals will continue to rise as both populations grow into one another
there are all sorts of ways to mitigate them , both lethal and nonlethal
some work better than others
reinstilling their fear will help
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity313 .
