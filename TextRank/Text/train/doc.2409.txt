@entity0 -- the candidate who campaigned on ending @entity4 - fought wars has become a president who finds himself repeatedly deciding on , planning for and sometimes declining military incursions
after authorizing a troop surge in @entity9 , air support in @entity11 , and limited military aid to rebels in @entity14 , president @entity7 has now decided to send advisers to @entity16 , where @entity18 militants are on the move
the tension that often exists between the executive and legislative branches over foreign intervention , however , is largely absent for now
@entity7 diffused any criticism from @entity25 by notifying it earlier this week that he was dispatching 275 troops to @entity16 to bolster security at the @entity29 in @entity30
he wrote in a letter to lawmakers that it was " part of my efforts to keep the @entity25 fully informed , consistent with the @entity36
" after meeting with senior members of the @entity39 and @entity40 on thursday , lawmakers reported that @entity7 insisted that he had the authority for any military action , based on authorization from @entity25 in 2011 and 2003
@entity7 then announced the limited action involving advisers and support for the @entity16 military , and that @entity4 combat troops would not be part of the equation
@entity7 : military advisers will go to @entity16 , but @entity4 not returning to combat no complaining he also left the door open for " targeted and precise military action " later on , if the situation required
@entity25 has not complained about an overreach of presidential power
@entity60 @entity59 said she believed @entity7 has the authority he needs for the actions he 's announced
they could , however , invoke the @entity36 -- also known as the @entity36 -- if @entity7 decides on steps that might include limited drone or air strikes strikes , or any use of ground troops
sen. @entity69 , @entity70 , who is pushing to approve a resolution on the criteria for authorizing military force to replace the one approved after 9/11 , also believes @entity7 has the authority to carry out the measures he 's committed to so far
" but if the president is proposing a long - term commitment of military advisers or a more robust presence than just 300 assets on the ground , then i think he needs to come to the @entity25 for authorization , " @entity69 said
@entity7 also promised on thursday to " consult closely " with @entity25 throughout the process
" @entity89 " is a broad term that based on previous yet similar scenarios likely means discussing with select members rather than seeking formal authorization
@entity7 's history discussing " with relevant members " is what @entity7 did while considering military action in response to the use of chemical weapons by the regime of @entity14 leader @entity98 last year
many members of @entity25 were against such action , and it never came about as @entity14 ultimately agreed to relinquish its chemical stockpiles
@entity7 did not seek congressional consent when he authorized action by @entity4 warplanes as part of a @entity107 air mission in @entity11 , nor when the @entity4 expanded operations in @entity9
in both instances , members of @entity25 complained loudly , but he defended his decisions
in the case of @entity11 , the president said at the time that @entity4 troops would not be on the ground and so the law did n't apply
in @entity9 , @entity7 said congressional authorization to use force approved in 2001 sufficed
the good and the bad : president @entity7 's military options in @entity16 @entity36 legislation while the @entity36 is an effort to give @entity25 more say in matters when @entity4 troops are sent to war , it 's been a point of contention
@entity25 passed the latest measure in 1973 in response to steps taken by the executive branch during @entity132 , overriding a veto at the time by president @entity135
the law requires that the president seek consent from @entity25 before force is used or within 60 days of the start of hostilities , and that the president provide @entity25 with reports throughout the conflict
presidents do n't often follow it , saying it violates the chief executive 's constitutional authority as commander - in - chief
" where you stand on this issue depends on where you sit , " said @entity151 , professor of law at @entity152 , previously told @entity1
that 's why when @entity7 was a senator and candidate for president , he said the president ca n't authorize a military attack unless it involves " stopping and actual or imminent threat to the nation
" but now he , as president , has followed the precedent set by those before him who bypassed @entity25
since the law 's passage in 1973 , the president used military force without congressional consent in @entity172 in 1983 , @entity173 in 1989 , @entity16 in 1991 , @entity174 in 1994 and @entity175 in 1999
a congressionally approved force resolution to pursue @entity177 after 9/11 was the underlying authorization to go into @entity9 , and a separate one was approved in 2002 to invade @entity16
@entity7 says ' small number ' of military advisers going to @entity16 opinion : can @entity7 avoid mission creep in @entity16 ? transcript : @entity7 's remarks on @entity4 response to @entity16 crisis @entity1 's @entity188 contributed to this report .
