-- @entity4 authorities have dismantled an armed underground group they claim was plotting against the @entity7 - based government and planned to launch an attack in a few days , that nation 's top security agency announced saturday
fifteen people were detained following a large - scale operation in the eastern city of @entity13 , the @entity9 said in a statement
the raid also netted about 300 guns , a grenade launcher as well as numerous grenades , @entity20 cocktails and a significant amount of knives , according to the agency
the @entity9 alleges the group was plotting to carry out an attack april 10 in @entity13
those detained face charges that include betraying the government and weapons violations
@entity13 is on the border with @entity30 in eastern @entity4 , a region that some say could follow the lead of @entity33 and soon fall under @entity35 's control
the city has a substantial @entity30 minority
a classified @entity39 intelligence assessment last month identified @entity13 , along with @entity40 and @entity41 , as possible targets for @entity30 forces seeking to establish a land bridge to @entity33
@entity45 says tens of thousands of @entity30 troops have massed near @entity4 's border , amid fears they may seek to invade
@entity30 says its forces are just on military exercises
those fears come on the heels of the ouster of @entity4 's @entity55 president was ousted and the emergence of a new @entity58 - leaning government in @entity7
that was followed by @entity33 leaving @entity4 and being folded into @entity30 following a quickly organized referendum -- a move that derided by authorities in @entity7 and officials in the @entity58
@entity35 's recent moves have caused the worst crisis in @entity67 relations since the end of the @entity69
the @entity39 and @entity70 have responded with asset freezes and travel bans against individuals and warned of further economic and diplomatic sanctions if @entity30 does not curb its activities
speaking to reporters saturday ahead of his arrival in @entity79 , @entity39 defense secretary @entity76 said that the " world will respond " to @entity30 's annexation of @entity4
" i think any time you have a nation , @entity30 in this case , try to impose its will to define international boundaries and violate territorial integrity and sovereignty of a nation by force , all of the world takes note of that , " he said
" all of the world should take note of that , and the world will respond to that
" @entity0 's @entity101 contributed to this report .
