they are a type of sea slug that grows to be about a foot long
with only 20,000 nerve cells -- compared with about 100 billion found in the human brain -- aplysia are the perfect lab animals for brain researchers hoping to isolate a crucial connection
plus , " they 're just attractive to look at , " says dr. @entity11 , a biochemistry and biophysics professor at @entity14
@entity11 won the 2000 @entity16 for his work with @entity2 -- or more specifically , for his work on the biological mechanisms of memory storage
for decades , @entity11 has studied how we create short - term and long - term memories at the molecular level
his work has shown what genes are changed during the learning process , how these genes are altered and how the changes contribute to the growth of new connections in the brain
@entity0 spoke with @entity11 about his research and why he 's fascinated by the human brain
the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity0 : why do you think the @entity16 committee recognized your work ? dr. @entity11 : there are two forms ( of memory )
one is complex forms of memory , which require the hippocampus and ( are called ) explicit memory storage
the very simple forms like driving a car -- once you know how to do it , you do it automatically -- we call that implicit memory storage
and the two involve different systems in the brain
being a romantic , i started out with @entity59 to study the hippocampus
i 'm thinking , ' that 's the seat of complex memory , and i want to get complicated
' and we succeeded to record from the hippocampus
we were the first scientists to do this and we were euphoric
a medical miracle : saving cholera victims but after a while , we realized that studying the cells in a region involved in memory is necessary but not sufficient
you 've got to see how a memory is formed
you 've got to see how information comes into the hippocampus and how it is stored over the long term
and when we tried to see what comes into the hippocampus , we found it very complicated to analyze
so i realized we had to take a very different approach
rather than studying the most complex form of memory in a very complicated animal , we had to take the most simple form -- an implicit form of memory -- in a very simple animal
so i began to look around for very simple animals
and i focused in on the marine snail @entity2
my colleagues and i found that learning involves alterations in the strength of communication between nerve cells
nerve cells communicate with one another at specialized points called synapses
and these synapses are plastic -- they can be modified by learning
if you produce a short - term memory -- if you look up a telephone number you just remember for a short period of time ( or ) you meet somebody and remember their name briefly -- you have a transient change in the strength of communication
but if you have a long - term memory , you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections
so as i tell my friends , if you remember anything about this conversation , you will have a different brain than you started out with before the conversation
@entity0 : so would memory work the same in a human as it does in a snail ? in other words , is what you 've discovered applicable to us ? @entity11 : yes and no. obviously human memory is much more complicated than memory of a snail
we can learn things that they ca n't learn , obviously
we ( have ) conscious experiences as well as unconscious experiences
so the level of complexity is infinitely greater
but the remarkable thing that @entity137 discovered is that evolution is very conservative
if it finds through natural selection that some set of mechanisms work , it tends to retain those mechanisms in perpetuity
and this is what one finds with the learning process
10 women who changed medicine @entity0 : what led you to neuroscience research ? @entity11 : i had no interest in science whatsoever
i went to medical school after having decided to do so somewhere between my junior and senior year at @entity160 -- very late
i initially wanted to be an intellectual historian
and i did n't particularly enjoy the science courses ; even in medical school , i enjoyed the clinical work much more than the basic science courses
but i found working in the lab is so completely different than reading a textbook about it
you know , you 're planning strategies ; you 're working with your own hands
there 's essential satisfaction in running experiments
i remember having dinner with my wife before we were married and telling her , ' you know , i can see doing this for the rest of my life , but it 's ridiculous
you do n't have any money and i do n't have any money
we want to raise a family , and i 've got to earn a living going into private practice
' and she goes , ' money is of no significance
' she has never uttered those magic words again , i can assure you ( laughs )
but that , at the moment , was quite inspirational
@entity0 : why has memory research held your attention for so long ? @entity11 : well , i think it 's a fascinating problem because it 's so central to everything we do
i once had the privilege of going to a @entity203 retrospective at @entity204 ( the @entity204 in @entity205 )
@entity203 already had alzheimer 's disease
with alzheimer 's disease , you lose explicit memory , complicated memory , so he would have difficulty recognizing people
but he would go into studio , and he 'd be another person because for a gifted painter , painting is like an implicit skill
it 's like driving a car -- after you learn it , you can do it automatically
and he did some beautiful paintings when he had fairly advanced alzheimer 's disease
@entity222 -- the choir conductor in @entity223 -- had a severe explicit memory deficit
he could n't recognize people , places
but when he sat down at the piano , he could play almost as well as he ever did
if you ask him afterward , ' what 's it like to play the piano ? ' he would say , ' what are you talking about ? i have n't played the piano in 20 years
the other reason memory is so important is there is a number of a diseases that affect memory storage , and we 'd like to know how they work so we can try to remedy them
@entity246 's death inspires doctor 's work @entity0 : there 's been a lot of talk lately about " mapping " the brain
why is that important ? @entity11 : the brain is the most complex object in the universe
and it is so important that we understand it , not only to understand ourselves and who we are , but also to be able to overcome many of the miseries that affect the brain
it 's not just schizophrenia and depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety syndromes and autism
it 's @entity270 's disease and parkinson 's disease and alzheimer 's disease -- dreadful disorders that we want to be able to help people with
so this is a major challenge
to see the president of the @entity277 announce this first , in his @entity279 address , and then more recently at the @entity280 -- and i had the privilege of being there -- is very exciting
they introduced president @entity285 by saying , this is our scientist in chief , and @entity285 broadly took on that title
so i think it 's wonderful
@entity0 : in 2004 , you said that we could have effective memory drugs in two years
why do you think that 's proved to be a bit more difficult than expected ? @entity11 : we have a reasonably good understanding of the molecular underpinnings of age - related memory loss
with alzheimer 's disease , i think the understanding is surprisingly good
but if we 're so smart , how come we 're not rich ? how come we do n't have treatments for @entity303 's disease ? there are two possibilities -- one is that we 're deceiving ourselves and our understanding is much less complete than we think it is
or , and i think this is a real possibility , we are starting to treat people too late in the disorder
by the time they come to us with symptoms of alzheimer 's disease , they 've had the disease for 10 years
now if , @entity320 forbid , somebody has breast cancer or colon cancer for 10 years and you sought treatment then , that 's pretty darn late if they 're ( even ) still alive at that particular point with this severe form of cancer
so the whole thrust in alzheimer 's disease -- or at least an important thrust -- is to try to get early diagnoses so we can treat people much earlier than we are now treating them
@entity0 : when you first began your research , did you think we 'd get this far ? @entity11 : well , you know , it 's a relative thing
when i started , we knew , on the level that i now work , practically nothing
we knew the anatomy a bit , we knew a lot from clinical insights , but we had very little insight into the underlying mechanism
and we 've made a lot of progress on that , not just in learning but in perception and motor coordination and development
but if you look at where we want to go , what we ultimately want to understand , and how large the task is , one has to be very modest
... there 's much , much more to be studied , and much , much more to be learned
moreover , the clinical benefits that we 've gained out of what we 've learned so far have been modest
the best is yet to come .
