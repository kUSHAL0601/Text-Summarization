@entity0 -- @entity3 's former maid filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the actress on monday , contending @entity6 fired her because she was injured carrying groceries
@entity9 's complaint , filed in @entity10 , comes less than a year after @entity6 's former nanny sued accusing her of violating labor laws and and making derogatory comments about her ethnicity
the suit says @entity9 suffered severe pain when she hurt her back while carrying @entity6 's groceries in june
although a doctor ordered her not to lift heavy objects and to get bed rest , @entity6 told her to return to work , the complaint said
" @entity25 was required to perform her regular duties , including but not limited to grocery shopping , lifting and moving heavy items as part of cleaning the residences , " the complaint said
" while the plaintiff was still in severe pain , @entity6 repeatedly yelled at plaintiff for performing her duties more slowly , and called her ' crazy ' and ' stupid , ' " the suit said
@entity6 fired her the same day , the lawsuit said
the complaint accuses @entity6 of wrongful termination and failure to provide accommodation for her injury
the lawyer for the actress did not immediately respond to @entity1 requests for comment
the former nanny 's lawsuit , filed in may , said she was fired because she refused to return overtime pay that @entity6 told her she did not deserve
@entity6 told her she learned from her accountant in january 2011 that she was paying the nanny overtime when she worked holidays or traveled to care for her three children , the suit said
@entity55 , a @entity56 , worked as a live - in nanny for the actress for more than four years until she was fired in february 2011 , the lawsuit said
@entity6 called it " an absurd lawsuit " with " made - up and fabricated " claims , filed by " a disgruntled ex-employee who is obviously looking to get money any way she can
