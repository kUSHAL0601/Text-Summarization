-- this week , we hosted a renowned expert in hiv / aids care currently practicing at a hospital known for serving the poor and vulnerable in @entity6
it was her impression that there has been a dramatic decline in the number of hospitalized patients living with @entity3
presently , in fact , the hospital is considering closing the service that cares exclusively for these individuals because of the small number of admissions
those of us involved in the care of individuals with @entity3 in @entity20 were amazed
at @entity21 and the @entity22 , which is our outpatient hiv / aids clinic , we remain busy seeing newly diagnosed individuals with @entity25 , particularly presenting with late - stage disease and afflicted by the classic infections and cancers so common 30 years ago , when @entity3 was first described
this month , secretary of state @entity29 gave a moving address at the @entity31 calling for an @entity25 - free generation , and the theme of @entity34 on december 1 was " getting to zero
" recently released data have shown a dramatic 96 % reduction in transmission of the hiv virus between individuals when the infected partner is on antiretroviral therapy , leading to the concept of " treatment as prevention
" treatment regimens are simpler : active medication regimens once exceeded 20 pills daily , yet now a single pill once a day can control the virus
nearly three dozen medications have been developed and are effective at decreasing mortality and improving quality of life
mathematical estimates suggest that an individual diagnosed with @entity3 infection today , while still healthy , can live as long as an uninfected individual
however , the fight is far from over
although enthusiasm remains high , an effective vaccine is still out of reach
in the absence of a cure , lifelong treatment is required
but perhaps an even more disturbing question remains : why do our patients in @entity20 resemble those who we saw on the medical wards in the early 1990s or see now in resource - limited settings , moreso than outpatients treated in @entity6 today ? despite tremendous progress , hiv / aids infections in the @entity73 continue to rise
nearly 50 % of all @entity25 cases annually are reported from @entity76
among adults aged 20 - 24 ( the fastest - growing age group to become infected ) , @entity77 has 81.3 individuals with hiv infection per 100,000 population , compared with 58.6 per 100,000 in @entity6
several important studies have documented the key risk factors associated with transmission of @entity3 , and all of them highlight social disparities
in the @entity90 , these disparities appear to be the most severe
according to the @entity93 's health rankings , the region ranks lowest in the nation in " overall health
" structural and socioeconomic factors play a significant role
poverty , education and literacy , access to health care , unemployment , homelessness and food insecurity all contribute to poorer health outcomes
a recent study that examined outcomes in patients identified with early hiv infection found that a risk factor for development of @entity25 was residence in the @entity90
furthermore , resources are scarcer for patients in the @entity90
for example , federal support is based on the number of cumulative cases of patients with @entity3 or @entity25 rather than the development of new cases , penalizing states with later epidemics ( like the @entity90 ) and those whose policies did not support early reporting of cases of @entity3
medicaid income eligibility is based on individual state policy
in the @entity90 , the income cutoff for eligibility is lower on average than elsewhere and is a fraction of the federal poverty level , leaving many without the ability to access this medical help
state health departments are often poorly funded or organized and do not have the same strong infrastructure and reporting capabilities that have been highly successful in @entity141 , @entity6 and @entity142
@entity25 drug assistance programs in the @entity90 are underfunded , limiting access to life - saving medications for patients
in @entity77 , which has the second - longest wait list in the country , patients may be less able to access medications for life - threatening @entity25 complications than those in the developing world
americans often turn a blind eye to the problem of @entity25 in the @entity157
the message has been that the epidemic is nearly over
even middle - class residents in @entity20 are unaware of the scope of the problem in their own city
there is denial that such striking health disparities can exist in one of the richest nations in the world
this disenfranchised population does not have the same political voice that the organized gay community had in the early days of the epidemic , when @entity176 drug approval policies were adjusted to help more patients get access to medications faster
our patients feel stigmatized and are afraid to be seen entering the building where our clinic is located
yet globally , the devastation from the disease receives attention not bestowed on the epidemic located a few blocks away
we are 30 years into this epidemic
how will we reflect upon the next 30 years ? will we say that we halted this disease from eliminating an entire generation in @entity192 ? will we remind ourselves of how the subcontinent of @entity194 was brought to the brink of disaster , only to be diverted by a worldwide effort to prevent and treat infections ? or will the already - devastated inner - city neighborhoods and poor rural communities across the @entity157 sink into greater despair ? will we bear the guilt for so many lost lives that could have been saved ? in our opinion , both missions must be addressed , not one at the expense of the other
if an aids - free generation is to be realized , then we must not forget the disease within our own borders
can we watch our neighbors suffer when the medical knowledge exists to change their future ? facing this challenge is no small feat. there are signs of hope
for example , the @entity219 has initiated the @entity221 for 12 municipalities , including @entity20 and @entity223 , for efforts to reduce @entity3 infections , link patients to care and reduce disparities
yet this is only a beginning
basic issues such as poverty , education , housing and safety need to be addressed
state and federal lawmakers must understand that basic health care is a requirement and will require money
one of our patients is a 33 - year - old mother infected with @entity3
she has taken her medications faithfully since her diagnosis and has been back at work for several years
she wants to raise her children to be happy , healthy and productive members of society
her work insurance policy recently changed
now her insurance will cover only one prescription per month ( maximum $ 200 )
her regimen requires three medications , which exceed $ 1,500 a month
state support and prescription assistance programs are restricted to those without insurance
she makes $ 1,800 a month , which she must use to pay rent and utilities , and feed and clothe her children
she can no longer afford the medications that keep her alive and give her children a mother
this is a tragedy that we should not be willing to tolerate in a society that values social justice and human rights
take action now by encouraging your congressional representatives and political leaders to keep their promise on @entity25 , increasing awareness in your own community , volunteering and / or giving to charities that support such efforts and sharing words of solidarity and compassion with those people most affected by this disease
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity283 and @entity284 .
