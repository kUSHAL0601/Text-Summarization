@entity0 , @entity1 -- the harsh reality of life and death in @entity6 is a common theme for @entity9 filmmakers
a still from " @entity11 , " the first commerical animation to come out of the @entity12
but it was the 2004 death of a young @entity9 woman -- not at the hands of a militant attack or an @entity18 incursion -- that struck a note with two filmmakers
their animated film , " @entity11 , " is inspired by her struggle with breast cancer , which is still a sensitive subject in the @entity9 territories
" the amount of trouble she has to go to just to survive , you feel somehow committed to be part of that project , it is so strong and so emotional , " director @entity34 told @entity2
@entity11 , which tells the fictional story of a young seamstress from a @entity6 refugee camp , is the first commercial @entity9 animation film ever made
the heart - wrenching tale follows @entity11 's pain and humiliation as she struggles to leave @entity6 for treatment after finding few @entity9 doctors willing to help
at first , one doctor suggests she loosen her bra , while another says her condition will probably go away once she marries
it takes six months for @entity9 doctors to treat her concerns seriously and diagnose her with breast cancer
@entity11 becomes tied up in @entity18 and @entity9 bureaucracy , denied treatment until it is too late
it is a devastating tale that @entity34 said is not unique
" the @entity57 refugee camp , which exists in @entity6 ... represents any refugee camp and [ @entity11 ] could be any woman , " he said
" the story could happen again
" the film 's executive producer @entity61 said it was a gamble telling such a tragic story using animation
but he believes that bet has paid off
" i think the animation has softened the harshness of the topic , " he said
" breast cancer and illness and death and @entity6 and the siege , it 's all heavy stuff , it 's all harsh stuff
put it in an animation style , give it a new dimension , give it a new perspective
" at a screening in the @entity1 city of @entity0 , audience members wept after hearing @entity11 's story , saying they related to her plight
one scene shows @entity11 checking her breast for lumps
the filmmakers hope this will help to break down barriers around a subject that is still very hidden in the region
" it 's very taboo to speak about the woman 's body in @entity9 society , but in the film it happens and nobody criticizes and nobody says anything about it , " @entity61 said
" the film breaks new ground by dealing with matters often swept under the carpet in @entity9 society
@entity61 said the film 's greatest endorsement came from the father of the woman whose real - life story inspired the film
the woman 's father said he cried when he watched it
" it 's a very human story and if it can touch the real family , it is a great moment , " @entity61 said .
