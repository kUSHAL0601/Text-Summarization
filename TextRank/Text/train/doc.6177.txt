@entity0 , a mechanic , was making a routine repair on a client 's car when his phone rang
it was a phone call that would change his life forever
" i was called in the morning by my elder brother notifying me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling , " he said
@entity0 's blood went cold as his brother continued , telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by @entity16
@entity0 knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group : just a few months before this , @entity16 had attacked his village in northeastern @entity21
armed men forced him out of his house and one of them pointed a gun to his head
by a sheer miracle , unexplainable even to @entity0 , one of the militants intervened , and his life was spared
their entire village was razed to the ground and so @entity0 moved his family to @entity35 and enrolled his eldest daughter @entity36 into the @entity37 so that she could sit for her final high school exam
he chose @entity35 because not only was it his ancestral home and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of @entity16 attacks
he felt it was safe -- until now
later in the day @entity0 's brother phoned him again
" then before sunset he called me again , and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by @entity16
" his wife @entity49 says the news of her daughter 's abduction tore at her heart
she refused to believe it when her husband first told it to her -- until it was confirmed on the evening news
" seriously , seriously , mum and her daughter
the pain is indescribable , " she reflects
@entity49 says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter
she describes her daughter as an ambitious girl who saw education as a way out of poverty
" she used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody
she used to assist the younger ones with their homework , " she said " she loved studies
she used to fall asleep with her books in her arms , " she added
her father remembers her as the caring eldest child who used to secretly collect his dirty clothes , wash them and press them for him
he also remembers her passion for knowledge
always she loved going to school , " he said
inside their small one roomed house -- there is nothing to indicate that the @entity92 festive season has begun
they say @entity92 used to be a time of laughter and spending time with family
" every @entity92 we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there , how can it be the same ? " asks @entity0
" there is nothing i can say
it is a bad @entity92
but there is nothing we can do , " says @entity49
a sadness surrounds the couple as they clutch to the only physical memory that they have of their daughter -- a few photos and one bright green top , one of her favorites
but although they are at low spirits , they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back
they pass on that encouragement to their other five children who say they miss their sister
" her siblings know that she is not here -- they themselves know what is happening , having come out of war , " says @entity0
" they keep asking me , ' when is she coming back ? ' but i keep telling them to keep trusting @entity135
maybe he will hear us , " he adds .
