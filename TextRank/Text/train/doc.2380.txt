@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was 4am when , still half asleep , we bundled ourselves into a van and headed to the southern @entity1 city of @entity7
we had spent the night in @entity8 , famous for its giant stairway featured in @entity12 's 1925 silent film , " @entity13
" and while we had n't awoken before the sparrows just to go sightseeing , our diligent fixers unexpectedly took us on a tour of the apparent back streets of @entity8
they assured us it was the quickest way out of town , but i was anxious because we had just three and a half hours to reach @entity7 where we 'd be joining the 43 observers from the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) international observer team as they attempted to cross into @entity29
the delegates were all from various militaries
punctuality had been drilled into them
they would not wait for a late television crew , even if we had been given exclusive access to their convoy
when we arrived in @entity7 , the @entity27 observers were getting a briefing about their planned route to @entity29
are you in @entity29 ? share your story with @entity44
yes , they expected to meet armed @entity47 military forces
no , they did not like their chances of getting through , but it was their mission to try
for almost three hours , we drove in a police - escorted convoy through sparse countryside and dilapidated @entity56 - era towns
it was a joy to see the @entity58 but at the same time , i felt some trepidation as it indicated we were approaching the @entity62 checkpoint and we really did n't know what to expect
we knew the men guarding the checkpoints up ahead were armed with assault rifles
the @entity27 delegates we were travelling with were not carrying weapons and the @entity29 authorities had made it clear they regarded any attempts by the @entity27 to enter the peninsula as a provocation
the team of observers had already been blocked on a different route to @entity29 the previous day
this was their second attempt
one delegate told me he was anxious about trying again
another said the delegation needed to be more forceful this time
at first our convoy was met with celebratory scenes of people waving @entity1 flags but the atmosphere changed further down the road as we approached the @entity62 roadblock
the men guarding it were indeed armed and wore balaclavas and military fatigues with no insignia
they stood below @entity97 flags
along the roadside , signs warned of land mines
while the armed guards looked threatening , they were remarkably calm as they faced not only repeated demands from the @entity27 observers but were taunted by @entity106 protesters who had followed our convoy
" this is our country
we will kill you , " shouted a particularly irate elderly man
a shake of the head was the only response he got from one of the masked guards
for two hours , the @entity27 officials repeatedly pressed their case , insisting they had a right to enter @entity29 , but eventually they decided their efforts were futile
the armed men would not budge
the weather was turning foul
the delegates turned their convoy around and headed back to @entity7 to assess their next move
we , however , stayed on
our man and wife fixer team had suggested they try to get us into @entity29
and they were successful but not before a hairy moment
as we waited to be waved through , two shots were fired
up ahead , we could see gunfire smoke near a car waiting to pass from @entity29 into @entity1
the @entity136 forces manning the checkpoint immediately assumed defensive positions and stood back to back , weapons at the ready
but they remained calm , relaxed even
these masked men may not be wearing insignia but their discipline indicated that they had military training
after a few minutes , they waved us through
as we passed the white sedan that had been shot at , we could see that no one in the vehicle was hurt , but the front tire had been shot out
hostile reactions in @entity29 after five days in @entity29 , our team was due to head back to @entity151
but on the eve of our departure , @entity153 airport was closed to all flights except those to and from @entity158
we would have to look for alternatives
by car or by rail
a road trip would mean at least 10 hours of driving with no guarantee we would get through the checkpoints set up by @entity136 forces between the @entity29 peninsula and @entity1 mainland
we had witnessed one of these gunmen shoot out the tires of a vehicle trying to cross into @entity1 at a checkpoint in @entity62
we did n't want to risk a similar situation
during our travels through the region , reaction to our cameras was n't always positive
in @entity8 we faced some aggression and were told that some @entity47 activists did not look favorably on @entity181 - owned networks
so with road travel struck off the list , we turned to the train timetables
so it seemed , had everyone else wanting to get out
the @entity151 - bound service was booked out but we managed to snare the last tickets on a train to @entity0 , another region in eastern @entity1 which identifies more strongly with @entity158 than @entity151
so we boarded the @entity190 express at 7.55 p.m. and immediately negotiated our way into first class to accommodate the 12 bags of camera equipment and personal luggage that we 'd been dragging around the countryside from @entity151 , to @entity8 , to @entity153 and @entity198 for the past seven days
the train conductor kindly gave up her two - bunk cabin for us and no doubt spent a restless night in an upright chair
that 's not to suggest that we slept any more soundly
the heating was turned up to asteroid temperature and our kindly conductor woke us at 2 am to fetch her cigarettes that she 'd left in the cabin
i guess she needed something to get her through the discomfort
still , it was a markedly better and safer way to travel than by car
the carriages were full of young families and senior citizens heading to the @entity1 ahead of sunday 's referendum , there was a plentiful supply of tea with lemon and sugar , and at $ 15 for a standard ticket and $ 40 for first class , it was a bargain
it was also hassle - free
despite reports of @entity136 forces inspecting trains in @entity29 , our only visitor was a young mute man who wanted to sell us night lights
we are now all proud owners of these small glowing souvenirs of a journey that may have left us parched from the heat , but which gave us one of the few remaining routes out of @entity29
at least until after the referendum on sunday .
