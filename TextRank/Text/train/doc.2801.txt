-- the 2012 @entity1 in @entity2 will see world - class competitors display their skills across 39 disciplines , with the @entity7 capital also taking the opportunity to showcase itself as a vibrant , modern , cultural center
a series of 12 @entity1 and @entity12 posters were commissioned to promote the @entity1 and show how art is firmly entrenched in @entity2 's plans for " the greatest show on @entity16
" acclaimed @entity7 artist @entity17 was tasked with composing one of the posters ; the 48 - year - old is championing the involvement of art in the hosting of the @entity1
" culture runs alongside the @entity25 , " @entity23 told @entity0
" @entity2 , and @entity7 , has a lot more to offer than just sport
" @entity23 hoped her @entity12 poster , which bears the words " you inspire me with your determination and i love you " and pictures two birds , would be a complete contrast to the marketing material for previous games
" i want people to smile and feel kind of warm and feel that they 're part of something and not excluded , " she explained
" the previous posters were a little bit on the macho fascist side
i wanted to do something which was the complete antithesis
" art historian and exhibitions curator at @entity2 's @entity46 , @entity44 concurs with @entity23 's views , explaining how @entity1 posters provide an insight into the political mood of years gone by
" @entity1 posters provide a fantastic snapshot , " said @entity51
" they really do provide a real insight into how posters communicate ideas at different points
@entity51 highlights the @entity58 of 1972 as an example of how @entity60 attempted to use the posters to change the way it was perceived globally following @entity64
" there was a very conscious effort to change the look and feel of that @entity25
fascist connotations of @entity69 have been utterly changed to brand it as a modern , democratic event
" according to @entity51 , @entity2 's push to display itself as a forward - thinking city is not confined to its poster
the logo , the brainchild of designers @entity77 , and the spectacular @entity79 also show how the city is attempting to stamp its identity on the @entity1
" the @entity77 logo was a very powerful element in the whole branding of the @entity25
if you look at ( architect ) @entity85 's @entity79 , a fantastic piece of modern , contemporary design , and the tower
" the tower @entity51 refers to is a 115 - meter high steel sculpture designed by @entity7 's @entity91 known as the @entity92 , which has been erected at the @entity93
@entity94 works for @entity95 , a firm that was involved in the construction of the @entity92
she says the red twisting structure will provide a visual thrill for viewers both near and far
" from afar , people in different parts of @entity2 will get glimpses of it , " said @entity94
" as you go there on the train you 'll see this object appearing
as you go closer to it , the scale of the sculpture , and the color , are quite surprising
" there are these mirrors on either side , which invert people and they 'll see themselves reflected in the sculpture
" it is eclectic , unexpected , it 's inventive
whether you like it or you hate it , you will always see it , like @entity124 or the @entity125 , as one of these eccentric @entity7 creations
