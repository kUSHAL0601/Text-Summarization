the @entity0 is used to having its decisions publicly criticized , but rarely in r - rated language spouted by a federal judge , who says the justices should just " stfu
" the remarks come from @entity8 - based judge @entity7 , who has a reputation for provocative commentary on his personal blog
@entity7 , an appointee of president @entity12 , criticized the high court 's ruling last week in the so - called " @entity16 " case
the decision gave some for - profit businesses the right to deny birth control coverage to their employees if they opposed on religious grounds
the 5 - 4 decision against a provision of @entity26 was predictably divided in public opinion
the senior judge made clear his views on saturday
" five male justices of the @entity0 , who are all members of the catholic faith and who each were appointed by a president who hailed from the @entity35 , decided that a huge corporation , with thousands of employees and gargantuan revenues , was a ' person ' entitled to assert a religious objection to the @entity26 's contraception mandate because that corporation was ' closely held ' by family members , " he wrote
" to the average person , the result looks stupid and smells worse
" and he went further
" next term is the time for the @entity0 to go quiescent -- this term and several past terms has proven that the court is now causing more harm ( division ) to our democracy than good by deciding hot button cases that the court has the power to avoid
as the kids say , it is time for the @entity0 to stfu
" @entity7 helpfully linked to the @entity60 to help decipher the popular acronym
it is not the first time his words have attracted attention on his blog , which he describes as enlightening " the role of the federal trial judge
" during last year 's budget battle in @entity69 and partial government shutdown , @entity7 spoke for many federal judges in expressing frustration over forced furloughs and reduction of court services
but most judges hold their tongue on such matters , in an effort to appear above the fray
@entity81 : " tell @entity82 to go to hell -- all federal court employees are essential
" and he was criticized for a march blog posting entitled : " on being a dirty old man and how young women lawyers dress
" he later offered his regrets at the comments , saying , " the only thing bigger than my ass is my ego
" there was no immediate reaction from the @entity0 to @entity7 's latest comments , and unclear whether the 68 - year - old judge would be subject to some internal sanction
@entity99 spoke with @entity7 's office , which had no comment other than to confirm the latest posting was his
federal judges in particular have to adhere to a @entity104 , which says in part they " should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary
" moreover , it also says they must avoid even the appearance of impropriety
this prohibition covers professional and personal conduct
the wide - ranging and often deeply personal thoughts on @entity7 's blog -- which he has authored since february 2013 -- reflect what he says is a desire that " federal trial judges be seen as individuals with all the strengths and weaknesses ( baggage ) that everyone else carries around
" in the wake of the " stfu " comment , he is again rethinking his online future
he wrote on monday : " @entity132 will be light while i figure this out
while i will make up my own mind , advice ( anonymous or otherwise ) , particularly from experienced lawyers and judges , would be welcome
" @entity0 women lash out at birth control decision
