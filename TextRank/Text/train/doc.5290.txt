-- it 's a great day to be a @entity3 superhero
" captain america : the winter soldier " took the no. 1 spot for the third weekend in a row , earning $ 26.61 million this holiday weekend , allowing it to cross that magical $ 200 million finish line
for comparison 's sake , this sequel — directed by @entity11 and @entity12 — has already out - earned 2011 ′ s " captain america : the @entity16 , " which ended its run with $ 176.65 million
what 's the real takeaway from all this ? that for all the idle chatter of audience superhero fatigue , no one is going to be putting away the spandex just yet
it will be interesting to see how " @entity29 " — already healthily earning overseas — fares when it opens domestically on may 2
will @entity31 audiences turn out for ' @entity32 ' ? initially it seemed like this weekend would be a tight race between holdover sequels " @entity15 " and " @entity36 , " but it turned out to be less so , with @entity39 's animated avians coming in at $ 22.5 million this weekend , bringing its domestic totals to $ 75.36 million
how the lure of a blue macaw voiced by @entity43 did n't succeed in nabbing the no. 1 spot is hard to say , but keep an eye on this one over the next few weeks to see what kind of staying power it may have
meanwhile the faith - based " @entity32 " continues to pleasantly surprise during its first weekend in wide release : @entity53 's film brought in $ 21.5 million this weekend , bringing its five - day total to $ 28.5 million
the demographics for the film broke down to 62 percent female and 38 percent male and , interestingly , 49 percent of the audience under the age of 35
the movie stars @entity62 and @entity63 as real - life couple @entity64 and @entity66 , whose son claims to have seen @entity68 while unconscious
review : ' @entity70 ' much less happy news is the $ 11.15 million opening of @entity74 ' " transcendence
" this cyber-thriller starring @entity76 opened to lackluster reviews ( such as ours by @entity79 ) and a meh @entity80 of c +
does this mean , finally , that we can stop with movies about sentient computers ? probably not
and do n't expect the stink of this flick to stick to @entity76 or his co-stars , @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity91 — we 're guessing they 'll be just fine
hopefully this will not deter longtime @entity95 cinematographer @entity94 from getting back in the director 's chair either
another new release this weekend , " @entity99 2 , " came in fifth place with $ 9.1 million
with a reported $ 4 million budget , this is good news for the @entity104 - led comedy ( tagline : " it 'll scare the # 2 out of you " ) , which may not have delighted critics but received a @entity108
