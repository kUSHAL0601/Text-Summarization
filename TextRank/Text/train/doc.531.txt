-- it was a tight squeeze for a giant new cruise ship sailing from @entity3 to its home port in @entity5 , @entity6 , over the weekend
@entity8 's @entity7 passed under @entity10 's @entity9 with about a foot to spare , drawing applause from people on board the ship
the captain called it " the great excitement of the day
" the normal height of the ship from the water level to the top is about 73 meters ( 240 feet ) , said capt. @entity24 , but the vessel could n't be higher than 65 meters ( 213 feet ) in order to safely go under the bridge , the captain said
to make that happen , the crew lowered the ship 's retractable twin smokestacks , carefully adjusted the ballast so the ship would n't be too light ( and therefore sitting too high in the water ) and boosted its speed
" when you increase the speed in relatively confined waters , the ship has a suction effect from the bottom , and that actually makes the ship go a bit deeper into the water , " @entity24 said
the plan went off without a hitch , and the ship safely cleared the bridge
video : watch from up close ( advance video to 2:05 ) @entity47 : watch from the shore the vessel is the sister ship of the @entity51
the pair are the largest cruise ships in the world
the @entity7 is scheduled to arrive in @entity6 on november 11
its official naming ceremony will take place on november 28 , and the ship will sail on its inaugural cruise in early december .
