-- @entity2 forces will begin deploying along the @entity4 border with @entity5 beginning in august and will be fully trained and deployed by the end of the month , government officials announced monday
some 1,200 @entity8 and @entity9 troops will be in place for a year to assist the @entity11 in monitoring and capturing illegal immigrants crossing the border into the @entity4
they will served as a " gap - filler " while the @entity16 and @entity11 agency hires additional staff to fill the demand in protection along the almost 2,000 - mile long southern border with @entity5
the troops , from the four border states , will be fully trained and in place in @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity5 and @entity26 by september 1 , according to gen. @entity27 , commander of the @entity2
the guard troops will not be involved in law enforcement activities such as arrests of illegal immigrants , but will assist the @entity11 in looking for the illegal border crossers and smugglers as well as in intelligence gathering
the airmen and soldiers will be armed , but they will be limited by rules of engagement that allow them to shoot only to defend themselves , @entity27 said
the deployment is part of president @entity44 's border plan announced in late may , when he also requested $ 500 million in supplemental funds to try to reduce the number of immigrants and smugglers crossing the border daily
additionally , @entity16 and @entity11 will move more aircraft to the @entity53 sector of the border , where an increase in human smuggling and illegal border crossings have been occurring , federal officials said monday
under president @entity58 , a border deployment of the @entity2 , called @entity60 , ended in 2008
the operation sent more than 6,000 troops to the four border states to repair secondary border fence , construct nearly 1,000 metal barriers and fly @entity11 agents by helicopter to intercept illegal immigrants .
