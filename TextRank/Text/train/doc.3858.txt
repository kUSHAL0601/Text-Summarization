-- @entity2 coach @entity1 has played down the threat posed by @entity5 superstar @entity4 as two of @entity9 football 's giants face off in the @entity11 semifinal on tuesday night
@entity4 has been in scintillating form all season , scoring all four goals in @entity5 's quarterfinal second leg victory over @entity16
the @entity17 will spearhead the @entity5 attack in the first leg clash at @entity2 's @entity21 stadium , but @entity1 sees the 22 - year - old as just one part of a formidable team
" what we know is that he is an important player but football , for me , is not about marking man to man , @entity25 told reporters at a pre-match press conference in @entity2
" it is not one against @entity4 and 10 versus 10 , it will be 11 v 11 , although he deserves special attention
" @entity1 is charged with plotting a path past the reigning @entity9 , @entity39 and @entity40 champions who are seeking to become the first team to defend the @entity11 since @entity43 in 1990
@entity2 drew 0 - 0 at home with @entity5 in the group stage of this season 's competition and were beaten 2 - 0 in @entity39
" @entity5 deserved to win in november , " said @entity1 , who worked as a translator at @entity5 in the 1990s before becoming a manager and leading @entity50 to the @entity11 trophy in 2004
" they are as strong now as they were then , but we are much stronger
i do n't mind if the football world considers them favorites , i think we have a 50 % chance of playing in the final
" @entity5 arrived in @entity2 on monday evening after being forced to travel for 14 hours by road because of the volcanic ash cloud hovering over @entity62
" it is not the ideal situation for us to travel 14 hours by coach after a league game and before a semi-final against @entity2 , but you can not stop a volcano , can you ? , " said @entity5 coach @entity63
" we decided to use two buses to have more space and i did n't travel with the players because i think it 's better for them not to always have their coach with them
" @entity63 is wary of the threat posed by a side who knocked out @entity80 leaders @entity81 in the last 16 and have won the @entity83 league title the last four years
" they 're a very strong team and we 'll need to play well twice
we 'll play our game and try to score as many goals as possible , " he said
" but we could lose because we 're playing against one of the best teams in @entity62
