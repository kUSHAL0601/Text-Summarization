-- a @entity2 judge , who drew a firestorm of criticism after sentencing a former high school teacher to a month behind bars for raping a 14 - year - old girl , is going to retire at the end of the year
judge @entity9 told @entity0 affiliate @entity10 his decision is unrelated to the controversy involving @entity13
@entity15 district court judge came under fire in last year when he ordered @entity13 to serve 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation for the rape of the student who later committed suicide
in december , @entity9 defended his decision , calling it " the right kind of sentence
" " if the @entity25 thing was the only factor , i would n't retire for that , " he said monday
" i 'm 72 - years - old , i guess i can retire
" @entity9 was first elected in 1984 and is completing his fifth , six - year term as a district court judge , @entity10 reported
retirement will " allow me to spend a little more time with my grandchild and friends , and maybe even get in a few more rounds of golf , " he said
" @entity36 willing , i wo n't drive ( my wife ) @entity38 crazy
" judge defends former teacher 's one - month sentence the controversy there is a pending complaint against him before the state @entity47 in his response to the complaint , @entity9 has acknowledged making controversial remarks about victim @entity50 at @entity13 's sentencing in august
according to the @entity53 , the judge said she looked older than her years and was " probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant
" @entity50 committed suicide in february 2010
" i am sorry i made those remarks , " the judge wrote in his november 15 response
" they focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant
" @entity9 said he weighed all relevant factors in passing sentence
" the defendant 's last legal or moral transgression was the crime he committed and admitted , " he wrote
" in the ensuing almost six years , he had legally and morally good conduct , he was reinstated in sex offender treatment and the undisputed evidence supported community placement and treatment
" the length of the sentence , @entity9 's comments and the age disparity between defendant and victim drew criticism and a firestorm of media attention
the montana attorney general 's office in november appealed the 31 - day sentence , saying it did not meet the state 's mandatory minimum sentence
