@entity1 's governor on thursday signed a bill into law that will require the labeling of genetically modified foods -- hailing it as the first such law in the nation
under the new law , food offered for retail sale that is entirely or partially produced with genetic engineering must be labeled as such by july 2016
" vermonters take our food and how it is produced seriously , and we believe we have a right to know what 's in the food we buy , " said gov. @entity12
" more than 60 countries have already restricted or labeled these foods , and now one state -- @entity1 -- will also ensure that we know what 's in the food we buy and serve our families
" in the absence of federal action , other states have introduced similar legislation or ballot initiatives , according to the non-profit @entity30
@entity31 and @entity32 passed laws requiring labeling , but they wo n't go into effect until other states pass gmo - labeling laws
@entity1 is the first to pass a " no strings attached " bill , the watchdog group said
supporters of the law expect it will be challenged in court
" i can make no predictions or promises about how the courts will ultimately rule but i can promise that my office will mount a vigorous and zealous defense of the law that has so much support from @entity1 consumers , " said @entity1 attorney general @entity45
the governor tweeted : " those opposed will put up a fight
" @entity58 , executive vice president for food and agriculture for the @entity61 , a trade group , warned that mandated labeling could make food costs for the average household could go up as much as $ 400 a year
she stressed foods made from genetically modified crops are as safe as any other
" and these same @entity69 crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications , less water and reduced on - farm fuel use , " @entity58 said in a statement
the @entity76 @entity75 approved a @entity78 label for meat and liquid egg products in june , the first time the department has approved such a label from a third party
gmo foods were approved for human consumption in 1995 , but the @entity86 never required any labels pointing them out as such .
