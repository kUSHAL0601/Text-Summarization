@entity0 and @entity1 are no longer on @entity3 's death row , but they are fighting for those who still are
@entity6 and @entity1 , two of @entity3 's death row exonerees , held a press conference on wednesday asking @entity3 gov. @entity9 to veto a death penalty bill recently passed by the state legislature
if the bill is signed into law , 13 people could be executed in @entity3 this year
the bill , referred to as the " @entity16 , " limits the appeals process and speeds up state executions
" if the bill would have been in effect at the time of me being sentenced , i would n't be here talking to you today , " said @entity0 , who five months ago was acquitted on charges related to a triple murder
new evidence was uncovered years after he exhausted his original appeals , winning penalver his freedom after 18 years behind bars
" there 's no ifs , ands or buts about it
you 're going to put innocent men to death , " warned @entity1 , who was exonerated after three years on death row
one of the bill 's sponsors , @entity3 rep. @entity39 , said the " @entity16 " will not kill innocent people
" we have more sophisticated juries today , a higher demand for forensic evidence , " said @entity39 , " so i do n't believe that keeping people around who have confessed to the crime , who were n't claiming their innocence , really serves the state that well
" the " @entity16 " would mandate the governor sign death warrants in capital cases within 30 days after the @entity3 @entity51 has completed its review
this is after the federal courts rule and the governor completes clemency proceedings , @entity39 said
the bill states that executions are to take place within 180 days of a death warrant being signed
if the bill becomes law , the appeals process in death penalty cases will be shortened and limited
" too often we have appeals that drag on regarding paperwork and production of records and effectiveness of one 's lawyer , and those types of appeals are brought by people who have confessed , " @entity39 said
@entity39 said the bill will " enhance the deterrent factor of the death penalty , " it will be a " tremendous help to victim 's families " and it will cut down stays on death row to " below 10 years
" this bill has nothing to do with justice but more to do with politics , said @entity85 , executive director of the @entity3 @entity86
" the premise of the bill is wrong
we do n't have people sitting on death row for years , " @entity85 said
" the average number of years is a year less than the national average
" the national average for inmates on death row is 14 years
@entity3 leads the nation in people sentenced to death and then exonerated , according to the @entity98
@entity6 , the state 's most recent exoneree , is number 24
@entity6 is asking for a meeting with @entity9 so he can show him his case files
@entity0 said after showing him the evidence , he would ask the governor , " would you kill me after reviewing this evidence ? would you sign this bill into law ? " @entity9 's office would n't say if he would be willing to meet with @entity6 but it issued this statement , " we want to hear from @entity114 about the merits of this legislation , which our general counsel 's office is currently reviewing
" the bill will be presented to @entity9 in june and he will have 15 days to decide whether to make the " @entity16 " law in @entity3 .
