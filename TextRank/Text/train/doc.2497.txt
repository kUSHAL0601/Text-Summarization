@entity0 -- a 7 - year - old girl whose body was found in a trash bin outside her @entity7 apartment building died of blunt force trauma to the head , was stabbed and had been sexually assaulted , authorities said tuesday
the killer probably lives in the apartment complex where the child lived or had ready access to it , said @entity15 , director of the @entity16
" we have multiple leads we feel are valuable and we 're going to carry those out , " he said
sixty - five state and federal investigators are trying to piece together the events that led to the killing of @entity24 at an apartment complex in @entity26 , about 40 miles north of @entity0 , where the girl was found three days after she went missing
@entity24 likely died between an hour and an hour and a half after she disappeared , @entity15 said
@entity15 also said that investigators uncovered what they believe is blood in a vacant apartment unit
they do not currently have any suspects in custody , he added
relatives of the little girl mourned her death
" my world collapsed , " her father , @entity39 , told @entity1 affiliate @entity40 in @entity42
" i could n't believe that they robbed her from me
" " they destroyed my soul , " her grandmother , @entity46 , told the same network
" they took a piece of my heart
" another family member , @entity53 , urged the state of @entity7 to " throw the full weight of the law to the person who did this
" police have asked for help from the public to find out who killed the little girl
she was last seen alive friday near a playground at her apartment
police initially thought she might have wandered off , but , after more than 48 hours of searching , they said they believed she was kidnapped
" it 's so close to home
to think she was just right there at the park and from there disappeared is the scariest thing , " @entity67 , a friend of the girl 's mother , told @entity1
@entity26 police , assisted by the @entity76 and the @entity16 , expanded the search area monday and began canvassing for sex offenders living nearby
earlier in the day , as volunteers and police handed out fliers with information and a picture of the missing child , her mother spent the morning in court trying to regain custody of her other children , who were taken by the @entity88 over the weekend in the wake of @entity24 ' disappearance for alleged lack of supervision
her request was denied and the children remain in @entity96 's custody , according to the @entity97
the girl 's parents are not suspects , @entity15 said
@entity101 had spoken with local media hours after her young daughter went missing friday , saying she just wanted her returned safely
