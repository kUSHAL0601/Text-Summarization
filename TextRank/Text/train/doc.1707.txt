-- the language of war leaves something lost in translation
@entity6 defense minister @entity5 on saturday spoke of " achievements " and the destruction of " significant targets " in his country 's airstrikes against @entity14 targets in @entity15
but on the ground in @entity15 , sources talked with @entity0 not about military targets , but about hospitals pushed to the brink , dead or distressed children , and airstrikes that struck water infrastructure
" no one is talking about the @entity26 civilians
when you bring up this story , no one is ready to listen , " a @entity14 spokesman , @entity27 , told @entity0 's @entity28
" but when it came to @entity6 , everyone is taking care and everyone is talking
" though a full - scale invasion has not occurred , @entity6 military forces went into @entity15 for half an hour early sunday and raided a long - range missile launching site , an @entity6 military source told @entity0
gunfire was exchanged and four @entity6 soldiers were " lightly injured , " the source said , adding that the mission was accomplished
the death toll from the airstrikes on @entity15 this week has topped 160 , @entity44 , a spokesman for the @entity45 , said early sunday
more than 1,100 people have been injured
on saturday , at least 23 people were killed in @entity6 airstrikes , said security and medical sources in @entity15
an official at @entity54 told @entity0 that the morgue there was now full
one airstrike targeted the house of the head of the @entity15 police , @entity62 , and killed at least 15 people and injured an unknown number of others , security sources in @entity15 told @entity0
@entity66 showed rescuers frantically digging for survivors
the airstrikes hit the house , which is next to a mosque
the sources say that some of the casualties had been in evening prayers at the mosque
and , an @entity6 airstrike hit a facility housing the disabled , killing two women , the health ministry said saturday
@entity82 said it was looking into that claim
four @entity6 airstrikes hit the @entity85 in @entity86 early sunday , shaking nearby buildings , including the offices of @entity0 and other media
the @entity6 military is telling residents of northern @entity15 to evacuate their homes for their own safety , @entity0 correspondent @entity90 reported saturday
@entity82 says it uses phone calls and drops empty shells on roofs -- what it calls " roof knocking " -- to warn civilians that airstrikes are imminent
concerns about a ground invasion by @entity6 forces are growing
the @entity107 on saturday called for a de-escalation and cease - fire between @entity6 forces and @entity26 militants , the 15 - member group said in a statement
@entity6 's stated mission is to get @entity14 militants to stop firing rockets into @entity6 , something that has not happened
even after days of bombardments from @entity6 jets , more than 36 rockets were fired from @entity15 on saturday , and the sun had not even set
two of those rockets were intercepted by @entity6 air defense , and 34 struck @entity6
the @entity82 said at least two rockets fired from @entity125 hit open areas north of coastal @entity127 , but no damage or injuries were reported
@entity6 asserts its right to defend itself , and so far the @entity14 rockets have caused no deaths
" achievements are accumulating in terms of the price that @entity14 is paying , and we are continuing to destroy significant targets belonging to @entity14 and other terrorist organizations , " @entity5 said
" @entity14 is suffering from severe blows and is causing severe damage to its people
" @entity14 frames the current conflict as a defensive fight
" what about the right for the @entity26 to protect themselves to protect their people ? " @entity27 said
" the international solution is asking @entity6 to leave but they 're not doing that
" electricity and water sources affected more than 500 homes in @entity15 have been destroyed or severely damaged , more than 3,000 @entity26 are displaced and hundreds of thousands have been affected by damage to water infrastructure , a spokesman for the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) told @entity0
electricity is knocked out in major areas of @entity86 , and at least one major line was struck , repaired and promptly struck again , spokesman @entity158 said
nine @entity153 schools have been damaged , he said
( on saturday , some @entity164 warehouses caught on fire , but the cause was a militant rocket that fell short and struck on @entity26 territory
) at least 28 @entity26 children have lost their lives in the recent fighting , and others are beginning to show signs of mental distress , said @entity175 , communications chief for the @entity176 ( @entity176 )
@entity6 says , as of saturday , its military has attacked 1,220 " terror targets , " including 632 launchers , 130 military camps , 106 " terror infrastructure " and 220 tunnels
that level of specificity has little meaning in @entity15 , where a public utility official told @entity0 that water , not terror , infrastructure has been hit
two @entity15 water wells took direct hits saturday , @entity15 director of public water @entity192 said
these water sources , which supply water to 27,000 people , " no longer exist , " he said
no de-escalation though some @entity6 have been wounded , none have been killed by the hundreds of rockets fired by @entity14 and other militant groups in @entity15
@entity6 's @entity202 defense system has intercepted dozens of rockets , helping keep fatalities at bay
hostilities between the two sides escalated this month after the killing of three @entity6 teenagers and a @entity26 teen
neither @entity14 nor @entity6 appear to be backing down , prompting fears of a ground invasion by the latter
@entity6 prime minister @entity214 left all possibilities open , saying the international community will not influence his actions against @entity14
he reiterated that there is one path to a cease - fire : the cessation of attacks from @entity15
the language seems clear -- each side demands the other to stop -- but it seems the two sides ca n't hear each other while they have their hands pressed on the " launch " button
in another incident saturday , an @entity6 airstrike killed six @entity26 in @entity86 , according to local medical sources
an @entity6 airstrike hit a group of people near @entity236 , killing a young girl and injuring five others , according to medical and security sources in @entity15
attackers in @entity15 opened fire and damaged an @entity82 vehicle patrolling the security fence in northern @entity15 , the @entity82 said
what 's next ? on saturday , not all of the rockets fired from @entity15 landed in @entity6
at least two rockets hit open areas in the @entity249
the @entity82 reported that it has called up more than 35,600 reservists
they are authorized to call up to 40,000
as concerns of a ground invasion by @entity6 forces grow , foreigners in @entity15 are planning their exit
one of the only crossing points between @entity6 and @entity15 , at @entity259 , has received about 800 requests by civilians with foreign citizenship to leave , officials there told @entity0
the 800 requests have come in over the past three days and have been approved , a crossing official said
that figure includes about 300 @entity267 , though that number is unofficial , the source said
medical sources described overcrowded emergency rooms in @entity15 and dwindling stocks of medicine , a situation that mirrored @entity275 hospitals at the height of its civil war
at one damaged hospital , eight activists formed a human shield in an attempt to protect it
the activists who formed a human shield are from various countries , including the @entity267 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 , said dr. @entity289 , executive director of the @entity279
he said the hospital caters to patients who need 24 - hour care , and thus can not evacuate them
@entity14 and other militant groups in @entity15 are believed to have about 10,000 rockets of varying ranges , according to the @entity6 military
@entity6 has said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets
@entity0 's @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity304 in @entity305 , @entity306 in @entity15 , and @entity307 and @entity308 in @entity309 contributed to this report .
