compared with the @entity6 kimono and @entity8 cheongsam , @entity1 's traditional dress -- known as hanbok , and worn by women and men -- has remained under the international fashion radar
so much so that when @entity15 , among @entity1 's most renowned hanbok designers , showed her collection in @entity18 for the first time in 1993 , most of the fashion press alluded to her silhouettes as " kimonos " -- to the horror of both the designer herself and everyone back in @entity12
it 's only relatively recently that hanbok has been gaining widespread attention , with top foreign designers looking to hanbok for inspiration in the past few years
@entity29 and @entity30 both had heavily hanbok - influenced designs in their 2011 spring collections
@entity33 and @entity34 are also fans , with the latter often stopping by @entity15 's hanbok atelier in @entity12 for fabric and design inspiration when she 's in town
made to wear for hanbok , the concept of off - the - rack does n't really exist
every hanbok is customized to fit the wearer 's body
women 's hanbok consists of only two primary pieces
the chima is a full , high skirt , made even fuller with a mujigi ( petticoat )
the jeogori is a long - sleeved top with two goreum ( long ties )
nevertheless , hanbok is a complicated garment
there 's also the binyeo ( traditional headpiece ) and embroidered footwear
men 's hanbok is simpler
variation tends to be limited to the overcoat , while the jeogori and pants stay fairly uniform
men also have a headpiece -- the gat is a traditional hat
men can also add a jjoki ( vest )
from the first visit for an initial fitting , the total production time usually ranges from one to three weeks , with more intricate hanbok taking longer
color as design rather than embroidery , which was reserved for royal wear , color is the most important element
" @entity87 is all about color , " says @entity15
" the color is the design
it 's not about what 's stuck on it
" and we need to know where they 're going , and for what occasion they 're wearing it
our clothes are more difficult to wear than @entity99 clothing
" @entity15 uses natural dyes for her hanbok to create beautiful , traditional colors , even though , as a pioneer of modern hanbok design , her hanbok can also be unconventional , as her " wind dresses " in the gallery above
other designers tend to stick closer to the original design
" i am a fan of the traditional silhouette , which is what i stick to , " says designer @entity111 soon , whose celebrated store @entity113 celebrates its 20th anniversary this year
@entity111 soon , who showed a small fashion show of hanbok in @entity119 this august , is passionate about bringing the @entity121 silhouette to overseas audiences
her wedding line of white hanbok ( unusual in modern times ) is a nod to the 1870s , when @entity99 influences came to @entity121 clothing for the first time and brides modified their hanbok in the @entity99 bridal style , wearing them with veils and lace
significance of color these days , @entity121 themselves tend to break out the hanbok only for special occasions such as weddings , funerals , first birthdays and major family gatherings
while in the past , hanbok colors carried important implications , such as class , these days the choice of color is more about what suits the wearer and the wearer 's situation the best , rather than reflecting status
still , some rules apply
although both @entity157 and @entity158 brought international attention to hanbok during their trips to @entity1 by wearing pink hanbok , they actually committed fashion faux pas in doing so -- pink is rarely worn beyond childhood , with the exception of perhaps engagement ceremonies
" natural dyes are the most beautiful , " says @entity15
" the colors come out more subdued and the natural dyes can also be used to go darker to make a point
" our ancestors truly made hanbok as works of art. the colors are most beautiful when natural
" according to the design team at @entity177 , lighter , pastel colors are best suited for warmer months , while deeper colors are more popular during colder months
special dress " the designer has to propose the design to the customer , so it 's best to talk to the designer a lot , " says @entity181 , director of @entity183 boutique , who designs contemporary ( gaeryang ) rather than traditional ( jeontong ) hanbok
" what i hear from my [ @entity121 ] customers is that there 's nowhere to wear hanbok , " says @entity181
" but i do n't think there 's a need for us to think of hanbok as everyday wear , because we already have everyday clothes that we 're used to , and instead @entity121 should think of them as outfits for special occasions
" in recent years , there 's been more of a foreign demand for the @entity121 traditional dress
according to the staff at @entity210 , more than 30 % of their customers are foreign , ranging from foreign brides of @entity121 grooms to fashion designers and artists to tourists looking for interesting souvenirs of their trip to @entity1
