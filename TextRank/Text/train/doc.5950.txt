@entity0 -- the deaths of five infants and more than 70 reports of children nearly falling out of a popular infant recliner have the federal government looking to stop the sales and manufacture of the product
the @entity11 announced wednesday it filed an administrative complaint against @entity13 , after discussions with the company and its representatives seeking a voluntary recall plan broke down
the recliners , manufactured by @entity13 , based in @entity19 , @entity20 , include the @entity21 and @entity23 infant models
the @entity11 alleges parents who continue to use the products are putting their infants at significant risk of injury and death
" my heart goes out to the parents and families of children who are injured or lose their lives in incidents associated with consumer products , " @entity11 commissioner @entity30 said in a statement released in conjunction with the agency 's announcement
the complaint seeks a court order requiring the company to notify the public about the defect and offer consumers a full refund
@entity1 contacted @entity13 , but did not receive a response
the administrative complaint , a charging document used by the courts , is the latest in an ongoing dispute between the government and @entity13 over the safety of the recliners
in july 2010 , @entity13 and the @entity11 issued a joint recall and refund of the company 's @entity60 recliner
there was one death and 22 reports of infants hanging or falling out over the side of the @entity21 regardless of whether parents used the harness as instructed , the @entity11 said
" i joined my colleagues in voting to issue the complaint because i believe that the legal theory described in the complaint concerning the reasonably foreseeable misuse of @entity13 ' products deserves a thorough vetting by an administrative law judge , " @entity30 said
despite design improvements , warnings and instructions to the company 's @entity82 model and @entity23 recliner , there have been four more fatalities , the @entity11 alleged
the @entity21 recliner is designed for sleeping , resting and playing and includes a shaped foam base with an inclined indentation for the baby to sit and a fitted fabric cover with a three - point harness , the @entity11 said
five thousand @entity60 and 50,000 generation two models were sold between 2009 and early 2012 and have been discontinued
one hundred thousand @entity95 models have been sold since january 2011 , according to the @entity11
all were priced around $ 130
