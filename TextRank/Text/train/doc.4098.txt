@entity0 -- the @entity4 ' plans to beef up its missile defenses against @entity6 are likely to inflame tensions that are running high over @entity9 's nuclear program , @entity2 said monday
" bolstering missile defenses will only intensify antagonism , and it does n't help to solve the issue , " @entity10 , a spokesman for the @entity2 @entity11 , said at a regular news briefing in @entity13
the @entity4 will deploy additional ground - based missile interceptors on the @entity20 as part of efforts to enhance the nation 's ability to defend itself from attack by @entity6 , defense secretary @entity17 announced friday
the @entity4 announcement came after @entity6 recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on @entity28 and the @entity4 in response to stepped - up @entity31 sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month
under threat , @entity28 mull nuclear weapons the threat from the regime of young leader @entity37 was part of a recent barrage of vitriolic statements , which included a vow to nullify the armistice agreement that stopped the @entity43 in 1953
@entity45 and @entity46 officials have said current @entity4 missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat , and president @entity49 said in an interview with @entity51 last week that he did n't think @entity6 could carry out a missile attack on the @entity4
" they probably ca n't , but we do n't like the margin of error , " @entity49 said
the 14 additional interceptors , to be installed by 2017 , would bring the total to 44 , according to the @entity58
" the reason that we are doing what we are doing and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security is to not take any chances , is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency , " @entity59 said
concerns about regional stability but @entity10 said monday that @entity2 believes that the anti-missile issue " matters to global strategic balance and regional stability
it also matters to strategic trust between relevant countries
" @entity6 on saturday responded to the @entity4 announcement by criticizing what it described as the @entity4 ' " hostile policy " and saying it wo n't negotiate with them over its nuclear program
its nuclear weapons " serve as an all - powerful treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty and security of the country , " a @entity86 spokesman said , according to the @entity6 's state - run @entity88
" therefore , they can not be disputed ... as long as the @entity4 nuclear threat and hostile policy persist
" tensions on the @entity97 escalated in december , when @entity6 successfully launched a long - range rocket , putting a satellite in space for the first time
the @entity4 and other @entity103 nations called the launch a test of ballistic missile technology , and the @entity31 tightened sanctions on the regime in @entity9
@entity6 responded angrily to the @entity31 measures , vowing to carry out its third nuclear test
it made good on its promise last month , prompting the @entity31 to expand sanctions further , which in turn set off the latest flurry of fiery @entity6 rhetoric
