@entity0 -- president @entity5 , speaking to a gathering of gay and lesbian activists , said saturday that he is committed to equality , citing the repeal of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy as an example
@entity5 said his accomplishments on gay rights issues have been substantial since he last headlined the annual @entity13 of the @entity14 , in 2009
he acknowledged " we have more work to do , " including on the issue of bullying
the president currently supports same - sex civil unions , and has said his views on gay marriage are " evolving
" he recently announced his support of the @entity24 , a bill that would repeal the @entity26 , a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman
organizations working actively to legalize same - sex marriage say they hope @entity5 eventually changes his stance
while @entity5 spoke saturday about equality , he did not speak on the marriage issue
the president chided participants in a @entity39 presidential debate last month for not rebuking members of the audience who booed a gay soldier who asked about the repeal of " @entity44
" " we do n't believe in standing silent when that happens , " @entity5 said of the debate incident
" you want to be commander - in - chief , you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the @entity53 even when it is not politically convenient
" after the debate , former @entity55 sen. @entity54 said he had n't heard the booing when the question was asked
@entity54 was being asked the question when the incident occurred
@entity5 spoke of growing tolerance measured , he said , by ordinary @entity53 : " a father realizes he does n't just love his daughter but also her wife
" @entity65 , president of the @entity14 , said after the speech that @entity5 reaffirmed commitment to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender @entity53
" it was a remarkable experience to see openly gay and lesbian uniformed service members in the audience be able to salute their commander in chief " about the repeal of " @entity44
" @entity5 's remarks were delivered to a key constituency that has n't always been receptive to the president 's policies and style of leadership
" i 'd like to see the president bring his message of support for the freedom to marry to a broader audience , perhaps in a conversational setting , so that all @entity53 can hear him talk about why marriage matters to loving gay and lesbian couples and their families , " said @entity88 , the founder and president of @entity90
" it is important that the president lay out the case for @entity53 opening their hearts to the values of fairness and treating others as they would want to be treated
" @entity88 , along with other organizations advocating for legal same - sex marriages , said the @entity5 administration had made significant progress on some issues , but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal
" we applaud the administration 's progress , while we also encourage him to ' evolve faster ' on supporting full marriage equality , " @entity110 , media director for @entity111 , said saturday
he said he was n't aware of any opposition within his organization to the @entity14 's selection of @entity5 as their keynote speaker
" we look forward to the day soon when our president stands with that pro-equality majority , " @entity110 added
the @entity122 , an organization that represents gay and lesbian conservatives , said @entity5 's appearance saturday night was more about politics than substantive policy change
" president @entity5 's appearance at the @entity131 this evening is more emblematic of their role as an ostensibly partisan organization than a representation of the gay and lesbian community , " said @entity127 , the group 's deputy executive director
@entity127 said @entity5 's stance on gay marriage did n't match that of most @entity53
" as all @entity53 are becoming open to marriage equality , the president is taking a retreat , " @entity127 said
" instead he is turning to the gay community for money and applause
" if the president wants to deserve all the money and adulation he has already received from the gay community , he should announce his firm support for everyone 's freedom to marry , " @entity127 said
saturday 's event was expected to draw 3,000 gay activists , and took place at a convention center in downtown @entity0
the speech was streamed live online
a @entity1 / @entity160 poll taken sept. 9 - 11 showed 53 % of @entity53 believe marriages between gay and lesbian couples should be considered valid
that number has steadily been rising in @entity1 / @entity160 polls since 2008
@entity1 's @entity166 contributed to this report .
