@entity0 -- @entity4 's largest @entity3 party , the @entity2 , lost its grip on legislative power after the country 's highest court declared parliament invalid thursday
the @entity2 dominated parliamentary elections in december , winning about half the seats
but @entity4 's interim military rulers -- who have long been at odds with the @entity2 -- declared full legislative authority in the aftermath of the ruling
on monday , however , the party declared that it its candidate @entity18 had won 52.5 % of the votes in the weekend presidential election , putting the party in a position to reclaim power
what is the @entity2 ? the @entity2 is a religious and political group founded on the belief that @entity26 is not simply a religion , but a way of life
it advocates a move away from secularism , and a return to the rules of the @entity34 as a basis for healthy families , communities , and states
the movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals
however , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past , and critics blame the @entity2 for sparking troubles elsewhere in the @entity48
many consider it the forerunner of modern militant islamism
when was it created ? the @entity2 has been part of the political scene in @entity4 for more than 80 years
it was formed there by @entity57 in 1928
teacher @entity58 and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the @entity61 from control in @entity4 , and to rid their country of what they saw as " corrupting " @entity67 influences
what is its history ? in its early years , the group concentrated on religion , education and social services , but as its membership grew , it moved into the political sphere , organizing protests against the @entity4 government
in the 1940s , an armed wing of the @entity2 was blamed for a string of violent acts , including the assassination of @entity4 prime minister @entity83 in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the @entity2 @entity58 himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government
the movement went underground in the 1950s , and decades of oppression by successive @entity4 rulers led many of the @entity2 's members to flee abroad , while others were jailed
the @entity2 grew throughout the 1980s as part of a general growth of interest in @entity26 , and the @entity99 - led invasion of @entity100 in 2003 saw a spike in membership
why is it important in @entity4 ? the @entity2 is the oldest and largest opposition group in @entity4
it has widespread support among @entity4 's middle classes , and its members control many of the country 's professional organizations
up until last year , it was illegal under @entity4 law banning all parties based on religion
but in december , it dominated parliamentary elections , winning about half of the seats up for grabs
how influential is the @entity2 elsewhere ? there are branches of the @entity2 in countries across the @entity48 and @entity121 and @entity122 , including @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125
there is also a branch in the @entity99 its offshoots outside @entity4 are markedly more conservative in their views : the @entity131 branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote
@entity134 , a member of the @entity2 in the 1950s and 1960s , developed the doctrine of jihad , and the radical group @entity137 is believed to be an offshoot of the @entity139 @entity2 .
