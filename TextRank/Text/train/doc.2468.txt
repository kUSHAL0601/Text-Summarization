@entity0 -- @entity3 is so sure that @entity4 will win the presidency in 2016 , he is willing to wager some of his $ 58.2 billion net worth
" @entity4 is going to win , yeah , " @entity3 , a outspoken @entity7 supporter , said at @entity9 's @entity8
" i will bet money on it
and i do n't do that easily
" but while @entity7 has said she is thinking about running for president , she has yet to announce
@entity3 suggested on tuesday that her announcement is a forgone conclusion
" @entity4 is going to run , " said the chairman and chief executive officer of @entity19 , later adding that " she is going to announce as late as possible
" " i do n't see how you could have anybody better qualified , " @entity3 told @entity1 's @entity21 in an interview
" i like what she believes in
... i think she 's extraordinarily able and energetic for that matter in pushing those beliefs
" @entity3 has long supported @entity7 -- he donated $ 2,000 to her @entity31 campaign in 2000
but the investor from @entity34 , @entity35 , supported @entity7 and then - sen. @entity36 in their fight for the @entity39 nomination in 2008
@entity3 was less sure about which @entity40 would run for president , he said at the fortune event
" i do n't know , " he said
" her opponent will be whoever wins the @entity40 primary and there are going to be a lot of people who want to do it
