@entity2 says president @entity10 's war on drugs remains a noble battle for the soul of @entity14
@entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity7 ) -- it has nothing to do with @entity19 or @entity20 , but there 's a big story brewing south of the border to which @entity23 should pay close attention
like a monster that refuses to die , @entity14 's once - disgraced @entity25 , or @entity25 , made a convincing comeback in last weekend 's midterm elections
the @entity25 recaptured its majority in the 500 - member @entity30 and won five of six governorships up for grabs
the rival @entity34 , or @entity34 , which had controlled the legislative branch since 2000 , suffered heavy losses
@entity39 @entity38 , president of the @entity34 , resigned this week after taking responsibility for the electoral failures
political observers on both sides of the border are calling the elections results a no - confidence vote in the @entity14 economy and a significant rebuke to president @entity10 's admirable but all - consuming war against the drug cartels
@entity10 -- who is in the @entity34 -- is halfway through a six - year term , so he was n't on the ballot
the presidency is next on the ballot in 2012 , and observers think that the fact that the @entity25 aced its midterms sets the party up nicely to accomplish something that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago : retake the top job that it held for much of the 20th century -- 71 years , to be precise -- through corruption and intimidation
in 2000 , the @entity34 's @entity63 broke that streak and reintroduced democracy in @entity14
@entity10 squeaked out a narrow victory against a third - party candidate in 2006
the @entity69 - educated lawyer and economist immediately and bravely took the fight to drug lords across the country , unleashing the military in a conflict that has so far killed more than 10,000 @entity14 with no end in sight
and there are now serious issues -- as spelled out this week in the @entity80 -- involving allegations of torture , forced disappearances and other abuse by the @entity14 military as it seeks to retaliate for the killing of soldiers and other terrorist acts committed by the drug cartels
the @entity91 administration , which has pledged to support @entity10 's drug war , would no doubt like to put an end to this alleged behavior before paying out the remainder of the $ 1.4 billion in aid to @entity14 that @entity97 approved in the @entity98
the trouble is that president @entity91 has been reluctant to make human rights demands of an adversary such as @entity102 , which could make it hard to lean on a friend such as @entity14
and as @entity14 human rights activists point out , the @entity23 government is in a difficult position to preach against torture given that it is accused of using it in @entity112 , @entity113 and at @entity114 , @entity115
still , @entity10 's war remains a noble battle for the soul of @entity14
and there 's evidence that the drug cartels are feeling the pinch
unable to move their product to customers in @entity126 and the @entity23 , the cartels are growing desperate
the @entity10 government is seizing so much of the product and arresting or killing so many drug traffickers , that profits are slipping
the drug lords are forced to import more guns from the @entity23 at higher prices and channel more drug shipments to @entity14 customers , who pay lower prices than the cartels could charge @entity23 if the drugs were making their way north
this is bad news for the traffickers
but it 's great news for the @entity14 people , even if they do n't know it
judging from reports in the @entity14 press , many @entity14 -- while supportive of the drug war -- think it ultimately will fail , and they 're tired of the violence
many fault @entity10 for , in a popular metaphor , " stirring the hornet 's nest
" meanwhile , although the @entity25 did n't explicitly campaign on a platform of being anti-drug war , the implied message was that returning the party to power could return tranquillity and security to @entity14
good luck with that , amigos
guess what ? the hornets are n't going back in the nest
@entity10 should get to the bottom of allegations of military abuse and punish any offenders
but he should also press ahead
and , if the @entity25 tries to get in the way by , say , limiting the resources to fight the drug war , then @entity10 should paint the party as trying to appease the cartels at the expense of @entity14
the @entity25 was so preoccupied with gaining power as it did in the past that it forgot that what leadership is really about is taking responsibility for the future
here 's its chance .
