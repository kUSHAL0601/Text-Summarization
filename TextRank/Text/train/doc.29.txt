-- out of the mouths of politicians comes a new lingo , especially during a high - stakes presidential election year
thanks to the @entity6 and @entity7 smooth talking contenders , voters are being treated to a refreshed vocabulary
sometimes a slip or sometimes a calculation , some words and expressions uttered by the candidates have proved so memorable that wordsmiths and wisecracks rush to the internet to stake out a new website or social media handle to capitalize on the moment
which brings us to the first entry in today 's political parlance : " binders full of women " @entity7 presidential nominee @entity27 uttered this phrase while thinking fast on his feet , in response to a voter 's question during the second presidential debate
discussing how he tried to bring women into his cabinet while governor of @entity37 , @entity27 stated , " i went to a number of women 's groups and said , ' can you help us find folks ? ' and they brought us whole binders full of women
" the remark spurred a political action committee to immediately mock @entity27 and set up @entity48 , dedicated to holding " @entity7 candidates accountable in this year 's election and beyond
" meanwhile , the social media world erupted with humor -- some of it good - natured , others laced with sarcasm
a similarly named @entity56 page features creative composites of images and written commentary
a picture of @entity62 in a library , for instance , bears the caption : " binders full of women ? oh sure , i 've got hundreds of them
" then there 's a photo of a laughing @entity27 as he declares , " @entity69 ? i just met her ! " " @entity71 " @entity73 and begorrah , @entity72 must have been channeling the leprechauns of his ancestral homeland when he conjured up this bit of @entity78 slang during the debate between the vice presidential candidates
the @entity81 @entity6 claims the word 's origin is @entity84 , like his own name , but the @entity88 @entity87 and @entity86 say the etymology is officially unknown
nothing like malarkey about malarkey
" you did n't build that " those four words from president @entity96 became a rallying cry for @entity7 everywhere , who portrayed them as offensive to business owners nationwide
during a stump speech about public infrastructure and individual initiative , the president said , " somebody helped to create this unbelievable @entity103 system that we have that allowed you to thrive
somebody invested in roads and bridges
if you 've got a business -- you did n't build that
somebody else made that happen
" what @entity96 built for himself , by uttering those words , was a mess -- and an opportunity for opponents to pounce
" 47 % " move over , " 99 % " and " 1 %
" the new no. 1 number this election season is " 47 %
" @entity27 spoke of this percentage , secretly videotaped , during a private fundraiser in may
the @entity7 nominee said 47 % of @entity103 will vote for @entity96 " no matter what
" " there are 47 % who are with him , who are dependent on government , who believe that , that they are victims , who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them
who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , " he said
after initially saying the remark was " not elegantly stated , " @entity27 later walked back the comment -- calling it " completely wrong " and promising he 'll represent 100 % of @entity103
but not before @entity143 pounced on it , by caricaturing @entity27 as an elitist who did n't care about less affluent @entity103
" @entity147 " then the presidential candidates became punny , er , funny
at one point , @entity27 wearied of what he called @entity96 's baloney
so @entity27 gave the country a new lunch meat : @entity147
" he is serving up a dish that is in contradiction to the truth , " @entity27 said about @entity96 in a @entity155 interview
the neologism spawned three namesake @entity161 pages
but a @entity163 search had yet to show , however , any delis with such an item on the menu
" @entity167 " @entity96 had his turn as a punster , too
@entity96 ripped @entity27 's tax proposals -- which he said stole from the poor and gave to the rich -- as " @entity172 in reverse
" " it 's @entity167 , " @entity96 said
that remark provoked the chutzpah in @entity27 supporter @entity177 of @entity178 , @entity179
he 's dressing up as @entity167 this @entity180 , which occurs six days before the election
he even posted a photo of his planned costume on his @entity185 account : a @entity27 mask with a toy bow - and - arrow set
" i 'm a fervent @entity27 supporter and disagree with @entity96 's initial quote , " said @entity177 , 24 , a student at the @entity189
" @entity191 " consider this : two grown men are running for the highest office in the most powerful nation on @entity196
their favorite show ? " @entity191
" and they are engaged in a tug of war over its iconic @entity200
at the first presidential debate , @entity27 said he wanted to cut federal funding to the @entity204 -- no offense to @entity200
on the campaign trail , @entity96 later seized the reference and mocked how @entity27 wanted to slay @entity200 to help solve the nation 's financial problems
the national laughter , however , did n't daunt @entity27
on thursday , he invoked the children 's show again at the humorous @entity213 , an annual fundraiser to benefit @entity216 charities
" by the way , " @entity27 quipped , " in the spirit of ' @entity191 , ' the president 's remarks tonight are brought you to by the letter @entity221 and the number 16 trillion
" last month , the national debt eclipsed $ 16 trillion
" @entity226 " not to be outdone the following day , @entity96 invented a new word , fusing his challenger 's name and amnesia
( @entity96 's critics earlier dubbed the portmanteau @entity232 , which refers to the president 's reforms to national health care -- a term the president has since embraced
) at a rally in @entity239 on friday , @entity96 lampooned @entity27 for memory lapses
" if you come down with a case of @entity226 , " the president said , " and you ca n't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website or the promises you have made over the six years you have been running for president , here is the good news : @entity232 covers pre-existing conditions
we can fix you up
we 've got a cure
" the partisan crowd roared with approval
by late friday afternoon , the new word was growing in the @entity103 lexicon , according to @entity185 's trend chart
@entity27 had no immediate response friday
but the sword play on words is expected to continue .
