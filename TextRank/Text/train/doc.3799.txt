have no fear , @entity1 is here
that seems to be the message in an epic promo released ahead of the @entity7 president 's annual news conference as the country 's economy plummets
the promotion , released by a state - owned @entity7 channel , has the feel of a movie trailer , showing scenes of tanks , crying children and plenty of @entity1
he declares in a particularly memorable sound bite : " the bear never asks permission
" that seems to be a problem these days in @entity7 -- it 's a bear , not a bull market
@entity1 who has held power for 15 years , is expected to address the economic problems vexing @entity7 as falling oil prices , a diving ruble and @entity31 sanctions have crippled the country 's economy
@entity33 is trying to prevent a currency crisis turning into an economic catastrophe , and finds itself more isolated than at any other point in the last 25 years -- due to its actions over @entity38
@entity7 's slide toward economic crisis and why it matters worried that their currency is now worth less , @entity7 have been exchanging rubles for dollars and stocking up on imported goods
and @entity7 banks and companies have lost access to @entity31 sources of finance because of sanctions imposed over @entity38 , but still have foreign debts to pay
yet in the lead up to @entity1 's press conference , @entity53 1 's glossy promo does n't touch on any of the financial woes facing the world 's ninth largest economy
the promotion shows scenes of war and triumph at this year 's @entity62 in @entity63 as the narrator intones in a baritone about " a year of tough decisions " and " long - awaited victories
" " how it turned out for @entity7 and its president , he will tell himself
" a defiant @entity1 proclaims , " @entity7 has never changed its orientation
" @entity1 still enjoys approval ratings in the high 80s
his popularity surged as @entity7 backed separatists in east @entity38 and annexed @entity75 earlier this year
could economic turmoil lead to @entity1 's downfall ?
