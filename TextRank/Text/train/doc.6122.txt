@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 preached open war on @entity6 troops for years
in @entity1 , voters ' fingers are dipped in ink so they ca n't vote multiple times
he and many other @entity12 in @entity1 shunned elections and fought instead with roadside bombs and rocket - propelled grenades
with provincial elections scheduled for autumn , however , @entity3 and other @entity12 say , they made a mistake by sitting out the elections in january 2005
their absence at the polls , they say , resulted in less political power for @entity12 and more for @entity24 and @entity25
some @entity12 say they plan to put down their weapons and instead join " the battle of the fingers , " a phrase for elections that draws its name from the practice of dipping voters ' fingers in ink so they ca n't vote a second time
" at least 80 percent of the @entity12 believe that the battle of the finger is more important , more powerful than the battle of weapons and @entity40 , " @entity3 said
more than 370 former @entity12 insurgents near @entity0 , 42 miles ( 68 kilometers ) north of @entity41 , recently signed a pledge to stop attacking @entity6 and @entity1 security forces
" you do n't shoot us anymore , " one @entity6 soldier said
" ok ? " @entity6 soldiers fingerprinted them and took retinal scans , saying they would detain " most - wanted " militants but releasing most others
men who are facing charges in the @entity1 legal system were given dates to appear in court
no one suggests that the elections will end violence in @entity0 , but it 's a step in the right direction in the eyes of the @entity6 military and @entity1 government
provincial elections are seen as key in empowering @entity1 at the grass - roots level and creating a political system that includes those who have been alienated from power
the @entity72 administration has set provincial elections as one of its benchmarks to foster political reconciliation in @entity1
" on the political front , @entity1 has seen bottom - up progress as tribes and other groups in the provinces who fought terror are now turning to rebuilding local political structures and taking charge of their own affairs , " president @entity72 said recently
@entity1 authorities originally hoped to hold the elections by october 1
yet details of the vote , including when it is to be held , are still being debated between @entity1 's main political blocs
gen. @entity94 , the outgoing top @entity6 military commander in @entity1 , told @entity95 two weeks ago that provincial elections probably will happen in november
whatever the date , one former member of the @entity99 militant group probably will be among those casting ballots
he said that spurning the last elections in favor of violence left @entity12 in @entity0 largely powerless
" right now , everything is being run by the @entity24 , " he said
" @entity107 willing , this time it will be better than before
