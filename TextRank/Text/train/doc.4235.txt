@entity0 -- the first giant panda to be born in @entity3 in 24 years has died just one week after generating huge excitement in the country as locals celebrated the rare birth
the seven - day - old unnamed cub died from pneumonia after its mother 's milk accidentally entered its airway , according to officials at @entity15 's @entity14 , where it was born
@entity16 , the head of the zoo , told reporters at a televised press conference that the baby panda was found not breathing on its mother 's belly
it had been returned on tuesday to its mother 's cage from an incubator , and zookeepers had heard its cries at 6:45 a.m. on wednesday
less than an hour later , they discovered the lifeless cub and tried to revive it by massaging its heart
the baby panda was confirmed dead at 8:30 a.m. local time
only panda born in @entity36 in 2010 named ' @entity37 ' " the cub swallowed milk into its respiratory organs and developed pneumonia , " @entity16 said , while wiping away tears
the seven - year - old mother , @entity44 , had given birth to the baby after conceiving naturally , a first in @entity3 and a rare feat among the bears who have a low birth rate and are usually bred in zoos using artificial insemination
the cub was celebrated by the zoo as a success of its breeding program , and officials held daily press conferences since its birth last thursday to report on its development
the cub was monitored around the clock and was occasionally placed in an incubator
zoo officials said at the press conference that 60 % to 70 % of baby giant pandas die within their first week
@entity69 leased the mother , @entity44 , and her mate , @entity71 , to @entity3 in early 2011 for a fee of $ 1 million per year
@entity69 is known to use gifts or loans of pandas as gestures of diplomacy
after the cub 's birth , a spokesman at the @entity69 foreign ministry said the newborn could promote better relations between @entity69 and @entity3
shortly before the cub was born , @entity84 , the governor of @entity15 , sparked outrage in @entity69 by suggesting the cub be named " @entity88 " or " @entity89 " -- both in reference to @entity91 , the @entity3 name of disputed islands lying 120 miles east of @entity94 that are a prominent source of tension between the two countries
in 2010 , a 14 - year - old panda under loan by @entity3 died while under anesthesia during a semen - extraction procedure
its death worsened the strained relations between @entity69 and @entity3 at the time over the islands , which are called @entity91 in @entity69
