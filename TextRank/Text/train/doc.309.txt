@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities said friday they have decided to move @entity4 , a jailed member of the @entity3 punk rock collective @entity6 , to a different prison
the news came only hours after her husband , @entity9 , told @entity1 that his wife had gone back on a hunger strike to protest being returned to @entity13 14 , a grim prison camp in @entity15
@entity3 's @entity16 for the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) has not yet said where @entity4 , who was sentenced to two years after being found guilty of hooliganism , has been taken
one of her relatives will be informed of her new location no later than 10 days after her transfer to the new prison camp , it said
a tweet posted by an art group linked to @entity9 , called @entity27 , said : " flash and micro victory : @entity18 reported that @entity4 will be moved to another prison
" @entity4 , 23 , was sent to @entity15 last year for her part in a performance of a " punk prayer " critical of @entity34 -- then the prime minister , now the president -- at a @entity38 cathedral
' slave labor ' claims in @entity15 prison camp she now has less than six months left to serve
but on september 23 , she declared the conditions at the prison camp to be intolerable and began a hunger strike
she has been hospitalized since september 27 , when she became so weak that doctors ordered that she be placed in the penal colony 's medical ward
she carried on the hunger strike for four more days and suffered complications because of the length of the protest , her husband said
@entity9 warned then that @entity4 would resume her hunger strike if she was sent back to @entity55 and conditions did not improve
in a lengthy letter last month to the news site @entity59 ( a translated version was published in @entity62 's @entity61 ) , @entity4 described " slave labor " and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties
@entity4 wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners tell her she is not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her
others are not so lucky , she said
prison authorities told state news agency @entity76 then that @entity4 was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment
@entity79 , another convicted member of @entity6 , went on a hunger strike earlier this year , protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp
she drew attention and won concessions
@entity1 's @entity85 reported from @entity0 and @entity86 wrote in @entity62 .
