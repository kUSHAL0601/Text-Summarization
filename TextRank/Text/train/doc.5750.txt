after the incidents , @entity0 - based journalists , many of whom work for international news organizations , staged a sit - in in @entity0 to protest the government 's tactics and promised a boycott of @entity4 press events
the office raids came immediately after uniformed and plain - clothes @entity4 security officials broke up a small student rally calling for political unity between the two major @entity25 political parties , @entity4 and @entity61
the split developed after clashes between @entity4 and @entity61 in 2007 that led to @entity4 seizing control in @entity0 , and @entity61 maintaining control of the @entity66
it was the second time in a week that @entity4 has cracked down on media covering street demonstrations inside the coastal enclave
on tuesday , thousands of demonstrators took to the streets calling for political reconciliation
according to witnesses , security forces beat up and detained several protesters and journalists covering the rally
the @entity80 - based @entity79 released a statement expressing its " grave concern " that @entity4 security forces " brutally attacked photographers and cameramen , beating them , breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage
" the organization called the developments the latest in " string of of chilling attacks on reporters in @entity0
" meanwhile , the cross-border violence between @entity23 and @entity0 led to five injuries
@entity23 air raids in @entity0 on saturday badly wounded three children , a hospital official in @entity0 said

the @entity99 said troops fired tank shells and helicopters backed forces on the ground
it had no comment on the three injured people , one of whom is in critical condition
but the @entity99 said two @entity23 civilians received minor injuries
@entity23 said three mortars landed in the regional council of @entity116 and two in the regional council of @entity119
@entity23 said it wo n't allow @entity23 's southern communities to " continue living under constant threat " and it holds @entity4 , the @entity25 movement that governs @entity0 , " responsible for any terrorist activity emanating from the @entity124
" constant rocket fire into southern @entity23 by @entity25 militants prompted @entity23 to launch its three - week offensive against in @entity0 from late 2008 into january 2009 .
