-- in many cases it 's a woman that grips the blade -- maybe clean , maybe dirty -- that cuts a girl 's path to womanhood
@entity11 president @entity10 wants to ban the practice of female circumcision in his country
the cutter , who works for a fee , can pursue any number of surgical options for the young girl 's rite of passage
she can remove the girl 's clitoris entirely , narrow her vagina with stitches , or make other excisions of the girl 's genitalia
a traditional symbol of a child 's maturity to womanhood , the girl undergoes a circumcision
often without an anesthetic , she feels every slice
and sometimes girls that become women under the knife die under it , too
in @entity11 , president @entity10 wants to outlaw female circumcision , and those that continue to perform the bloody practice would face the death penalty if a girl dies as a result of the procedure , press secretary @entity43 told @entity0 wednesday
" if a girl dies during circumcision that would be murder , " @entity43 said
" the punishment for murder in @entity11 is death
" @entity10 's move to ban female circumcision is in line with other countries and organizations that have sought to decrease the prevalence of female circumcision , also known as female genital cutting or female genital mutilation
the practice involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and creates scar tissue that can cause complications during labor
but in nearby @entity74 and @entity75 , where female genital mutilation is illegal , the practice is still rampant because people are not sensitized to the health consequences of circumcision and laws are not enforced , said @entity82 , an @entity83 @entity11 researcher
while @entity83 does not support the death penalty , @entity82 said the group wants to see @entity11 ban the practice
he worries it wo n't be done , though , because @entity11 has a " mixed " track record on enacting laws to protect women , he said
@entity43 , however , said he thinks that with the president 's support behind it , @entity11 's parliament will outlaw the ancient ritual
rooted in paternalistic culture and practiced for centuries , female circumcision in @entity11 is thought to protect a girl 's chastity by " reducing the urge for sex in women , " @entity43 said
in @entity11 , female genital mutilation is popular among tribes that live near the eastern border with @entity74 , @entity43 said
he said he does not know how many female circumcisions have occurred in @entity11 nor how many girls have died from them
the @entity110 and @entity111 tribes are the primary adherents to the custom of female circumcision , he said
the tribes , he said , make up less than 10 percent of the country 's population , which the @entity117 estimated at 29.9 million in 2006
the @entity118 estimates that 100 million to 140 million girls and women have been circumcised
another 3 million girls are at risk of being circumcised each year , the organization says
the practice is extremely painful and traumatizing , and can result in prolonged bleeding , a higher risk of hiv infection , infertility and even death , according to the @entity130
the cultural practice occurs in parts of @entity133 , @entity134 , the @entity135 and in some immigrant communities in @entity137 and @entity138 , with the majority of those who have undergone the procedure living in 28 countries across @entity133 , according to the @entity143
mostly women perform the circumcisions on girls ranging in age from infancy to 15 , the @entity130 said
in some cultures , women endure repeated circumcisions
those that do the cutting in @entity11 earn an income on the procedure , @entity43 said
what once was done for free and deemed a privilege to perform now rakes in less than $ 1 per girl , @entity43 said
even for a country that the @entity117 reported as having 53 percent of people living on $ 1.25 or less a day , " it was not big money , " he said
" poverty is quite a big factor and directly intrinsically linked to the economic interest [ in female circumcision ] , " @entity82 said
@entity10 proposes to distribute money to the practitioners to give them financial support until they find other work , @entity43 said
the money could come in the form of a low - interest rate loan , he said
governments and local leaders must promote other ways to earn an income to successfully outlaw female circumcision , said @entity143 spokesman @entity176
tribal leaders , especially , must insist on alternatives to the cutting ceremony , such as gifts , he said
while referred to as a rite of passage , the cutting also subjugates women to a chastity reinforced by scars and a culture that dictates that circumcised girls are more attractive to prospective husbands
" very often it 's the mother of the girl who takes her daughter to be cut
you know the reason ? " @entity176 asked
" because she feels , ' @entity196 , my daughter wo n't get a husband if i do n't cut her
" @entity199 's mother took her to be circumcised when she was 13
the @entity201 native said she felt " tricked into it by a person that was supposed to protect me -- my own mother
" @entity207 , now 47 , in 1994 released a movie detailing the practice , " @entity210
" when the activist heard that @entity10 wants to outlaw female circumcision , it brought back memories of her own experience of being " stitched like a curtain , " she said
" i thought of my first pain as a child of 13 and realizing this was not really love ; this was not a gift of womanhood , " she said
@entity199 , who received corrective surgery and has helped other women get corrective surgery , is writing a memoir about her trials as a " survivor " of female genital mutilation and the struggles to reconcile with a family that shunned her after she spoke out against the practice
she said that speaking out against female circumcision is not a betrayal of culture , it is a public acknowledgment of what is right and what is wrong
for @entity10 , it is a movement toward modernity
" you must grow out of that culture that is not supported by scientific information , " @entity10 says in a statement posted on his web site .
