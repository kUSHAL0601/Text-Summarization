-- we had no idea five guys with a clever photo tradition would capture so much interest
but the overwhelming response to a recent story about high school friends who 've kept in touch over three decades through summer lakeside reunions and a commemorative photo shoot made us wonder what other creative ways people document their travels , relationships and experiences
if you 're traveling with @entity19 , you know he 'll hand over a camera to capture him doing a handstand in front of some of the world 's noted landmarks
is the photo better than the vacation ? @entity28 , an aptly named stuffed animal , is likely to turn up in @entity31 's travel shots
@entity32 does n't need any help or props : she simply points her camera at her feet to get the right shots
in an era of digital photography and smartphones , it 's easier than ever to create special traditions
the photo essay is no longer limited to professional photographers or people documenting the first day of school , @entity47 or a college reunion
seven beauties of the @entity50 where the tradition starts @entity53 wanted a twist on the usual smiling - in - front - of - a - landmark shot
" i thought to myself , ' i bet there are n't too many pictures of people doing handstands in front of the @entity65 , ' " wrote @entity19 , an @entity57 , @entity56 , resident who started his tradition in 2007 when he was studying abroad in @entity59
" so i started doing handstands everywhere we went
i 've traveled abroad several times since that trip , most recently to @entity70 this summer , and the tradition has continued
" @entity73 - based ireporter @entity32 , who has been taking pictures of her feet around the world for about 10 years , thinks she started snapping shots in response to the question , " why do you travel so much ? " her answer : " itchy feet ! " @entity32 often travels alone for the great sense of freedom it gives her
from the stoop to social media @entity89 's photo project did n't start with photography or travel in mind
on august 25 , 1971 , his @entity93 - based trio of childhood friends were in high school when they decided to meet at the stoop where they always hung out in exactly 10 years
they did n't take a picture that day , but found a photo later taken about that time and decided to replicate it each decade
every 10 years , @entity89 , @entity104 , @entity105 and other friends and assorted spouses and children travel from @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and just around the block to meet at the stoop to take the picture ( standing in the same positions ) , play stickball and reminisce
now the photos are posted on former @entity0 staffer @entity89 's blog and the group 's facebook page
the men even made a @entity123 video of their photo shoot
" that stoop was our hangout , it 's where if we were n't playing ball or going to movies or playing records , that 's where we hung out , " said @entity89
the tradition and the electronic community the men have created is " simply a continuation of a friendship built 40 years ago , and we 're trying to keep it going and keep it alive
people post every day on our @entity142 page
it 's like we 're hanging out on the stoop
" last year 's 40th anniversary celebration was delayed by 24 hours because @entity146 was driving his daughter to start college in @entity150
" that seemed an awfully good reason to delay things by 24 hours , " wrote @entity89 on his blog
27 must - sees on @entity155 gratitude for many things while the photos bring back memories , they also remind people of their families , friends and other items on their gratitude lists
" i think about how blessed i 've been to have had the opportunity to go to all these places , " @entity19 wrote
" some were during study abroad , some were on family vacations , and some were for work with @entity173 ( @entity174 )
i also try not to take myself too seriously , so doing handstands is my way of keeping a light heart during my travels
@entity32 's ritual reminds her why she travels
" it 's ' me ' moments on holidays , key moments of being somewhere special ; capturing stillness whilst being on the move , " she wrote
it 's not too late to start a tradition a friend gave " @entity28 " to @entity31 of @entity188 , @entity111 , after @entity190 's gentleman friend of 22 years passed away three years ago
@entity190 , 63 , had always traveled with her companion , and now preferred to travel alone -- except for @entity28 , the stuffed polar bear
he has joined @entity193 on her travels around the country and became the star of her travel pictures
" some people when i take the picture will smile and think it 's cute , and some people look at me like i 'm nuts
" having bear along makes traveling more fun , she said
if you do n't want to take the same picture every time you travel or return to a hometown you never liked , you do n't have to make the same commitment as these travelers
" you do n't have to wait 30 years to get the same sequence of pictures , " says @entity211 , chief storyteller at @entity212 and manager of the website 's storytelling section
" it does n't have to be ' let 's meet at the lake
' it could be any day
you could go out for the weekend and take the same picture every day ( and see the progression of the weekend )
" for the hard - core enthusiast : a challenge for those of you interested in a more intense challenge , turn to @entity229 and @entity230 for inspiration
the @entity233 , @entity150 , couple , who married in 1984 , started taking a picture of themselves every single day about 20 years ago
" it all started one night when we were looking for pictures after many of our friends started to have kids , " said @entity230
" we had pictures of all our friends ' kids ( and ) we did n't have any pictures of us together
" now the @entity247 have pictures from all over the world
" when we used to live overseas , we were both teachers and we went to this educational conference where @entity252 was a speaker , so we took a picture with @entity252 , " she said
" @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 -- we do n't take a lot of pictures , but every day we have our picture
