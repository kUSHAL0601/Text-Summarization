-- when @entity2 noticed a small growth on her left hip , she did n't think much of it
@entity2 , 41 , found a bump on her hip that she thought was a pimple
it turned out to be skin cancer
" it was bizarre , " recalled the 41 - year - old salon owner from @entity12 , @entity13
" i just thought it was a pimple
" @entity16 , who is @entity17 , ca n't say exactly what prompted her to point out the bump to her physician , but she said she remembered thinking the diagnosis would n't be anything serious
" it never occurred to me that it was skin cancer , " she said
she had basal cell carcinoma , the most common skin cancer
@entity16 spent long hours as a child in the summer sun at @entity31 in @entity13 and went to the tanning bed before visiting relatives in the @entity34 , she said
she also said she never wore sunscreen
" back then , i just do n't think people were aware of the effects [ of the sun ] , " she said
those may seem like obvious red flags to people who are sun - conscious , but they were foreign concepts to @entity16 , which is why her diagnosis came as a shock
" i just assumed , ' i 'm a person of color , i 'll be ok , ' " she said
dermatologists say they are concerned because skin cancer rates are increasing among minority groups in the @entity52
like @entity16 , many people of color often mistakenly believe skin cancer is not something they should be worried about
pigmentation is no ' free pass ' the reasoning is not completely far - fetched : darker - skinned people do benefit from the protective effects of skin pigmentation
in fact , some studies suggest that for the darkest skin tones , pigmentation cells provide a natural sun protection factor , or @entity68 , of about 13
the problem is many dark - skinned people believe that means they are born with a natural immunity to skin cancer
" pigmentation does n't give you a free pass , " said dr. @entity74 , a dermatologist specializing in ethnic skin and the doctor who treated @entity2
" it does n't matter what color your skin is , everyone can get skin cancer
" @entity86 , for example , died of malignant melanoma , the most lethal type of skin cancer , that spread to his lungs and brain
all types of skin cancer are increasing among blacks and @entity93 , and their melanomas are more often fatal because they are usually caught later , according to the @entity95
@entity74 pointed out that pigmentation may have sun - protective qualities but even for the darkest skin it falls short of the @entity95 's recommendation of a daily @entity68 of at least 15 for everyone
@entity74 feels many ethnic groups are missing that key part of the message , if they are getting the message at all
blog : how to pick the right sunscreen researchers acknowledge that many of the messages regarding skin cancer prevention have traditionally targeted fair - skinned people , a group 10 times more likely to develop melanoma
now , dermatologists say , more needs to be done to encourage all groups to take precautions against sun damage
a @entity119 survey found only 27 percent of people with self - described darker skin applied sunscreen when they were in the sun for four hours or more , compared with 64 percent of people with self - described light skin
the @entity126 estimates that in 2009 there will be more than 1 million unreported cases of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer -- most of them curable -- and that more than 68,000 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed
for melanoma , the key to a cure is early detection
that 's why dermatologists caution everyone to be vigilant and learn the risks for their skin type
" race is very important because not all skin is the same , " said dr. @entity141 of @entity142 , a dermatology group focusing on the needs of patients of color
according to @entity141 , people with darker skin often get diagnosed at later stages because the cancers often appear in atypical locations
melanomas in african - americans and darker - skinned @entity93 and @entity154 develop more commonly on the palms , soles of the feet , toenails , fingernails and in mucus membranes like around the mouth and genitals , she said
in @entity164 and lighter - skinned @entity93 , melanomas more frequently appear on the back in men and on the legs in women
also , the signs of melanoma may vary depending on skin tone
" @entity172 can affect the way lesions look , " @entity74 said
" things that appear red in white skin often look completely different in skin of color
" historically , research and teaching was done on fairer - skinned people , making it more challenging for physicians to recognize suspicious moles on darker skin
while these differences present challenges , they are certainly not barriers
experts say , the best thing to do is keep it simple
" if you have any lesion or mole change at all , or if you have a spot that bleeds and does n't heal in three weeks , see a physician or a dermatologist , " dr. @entity74 recommended
" that 's something everyone can do
" visit the @entity95 web site to find free screening locations in your state another piece of simple advice : " all racial groups need to use sunscreens , " @entity141 stresses
the @entity95 recommends using a broad - spectrum sunscreen that protects against both deep - penetrating @entity212 rays and burn - causing @entity214 rays
not all sunscreens protect against both
visit the @entity218 's @entity218 cosmetic safety database @entity2 is heeding that advice
she said she 's learned that when it comes to prevention , the worst thing you can possibly do is nothing
" i use extreme caution in the sun and make certain that i use a sunscreen , even on a cloudy day , " she said
" you should n't underestimate the rays of the sun. "
