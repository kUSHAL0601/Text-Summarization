but the dispute is also about power

prominent opposition politicians have also led protests and joined marches

@entity20 residents and visitors have shared dozens of stories of unrest on @entity54 over the past month
the latest approved photos show demonstrators sleeping in the streets in @entity161 as a form of peaceful protest
