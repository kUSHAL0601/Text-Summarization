@entity9 state police commissioner @entity8 says five men kidnapped the woman from her workplace and are demanding a ransom of 60 million @entity14 ( $ 301,500 )
the @entity15 has identified the woman as the rev. @entity17 , a missionary based at the @entity19 compound in @entity9
kogi state is located away from the areas where @entity22 operates , making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to terrorism

the @entity4 @entity34 in @entity1 and the @entity35 have been notified of the incident , the @entity15 said
@entity17 runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic @entity40 children , the police commissioner said
according to her biography on the church 's website , @entity17 is the financial administrator of @entity19
" a special friendship with a clan of nomadic @entity40 has given @entity17 the opportunity to open additional schools for @entity40 children and their parents , " the website says
the commissioner said five men scaled the wall of the school where @entity17 's office is and " whisked her away , " jumping back over the wall and fleeing to the nearby mountains
two of the men were masked , and they fired shots into the air to scare people away during the kidnapping , @entity8 said
