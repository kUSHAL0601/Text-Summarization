-- a disastrous blunder by @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 cost his side victory as they drew 1 - 1 with the @entity6 in their @entity8 opener in @entity9 on saturday night
@entity3 were leading 1 - 0 through a fourth minute @entity11 goal approaching halftime when @entity13 sent in a weak shot from just outside the penalty area
@entity17 's @entity16 beat @entity18 it appeared to be a routine save for @entity2 but astonishingly he let the ball slip through his grasp and despite a despairing dive saw it trickle into the net
@entity3 captain @entity11 gave his side a dream start after he latched on to a neat pass from @entity28 to beat @entity29 in the @entity6 goal with ease
@entity33 's men were holding onto their lead comfortably enough , aside from a scare when @entity36 connected with a @entity38 cross to send his header wide , until the fortunate 40th minute equalizer
the second half saw @entity3 press for the winner and @entity28 was sent clear by @entity44 but shot straight at @entity29
@entity45 also sent a shot narrowly wide and cleverly set up substitute @entity47 for a chance from the left side of the penalty area which he sent straight at @entity29
but @entity53 hearts were in their mouths as @entity36 outpaced @entity55 , who came on for the injured @entity56 at halftime , and bore down on goal
this time @entity2 came to the rescue , parrying his effort against the post to partially redeem himself for an error which will live long in the memory
there was no masking the disappointment in the @entity3 camp at the final whistle
catch up with @entity0 's twitter.buzz " the idea tonight was to win the game , but unfortunately we have let a poor goal in and we could n't go on and get the winner , " @entity11 told @entity69
" the target now has got to be seven points
" @entity3 's next game is against @entity78 in @entity79 on friday with the @entity6 taking on @entity80 in @entity81
@entity33 would not confirm if he will stand by @entity2 for a game which now takes on added significance
" sometimes a forward misses a goal and sometimes the keeper makes a mistake , this is football
the second half he played very well , " said the @entity89 .
