@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government stepped in monday to weaken the yen , after it climbed to a @entity5 high against the dollar
finance minister @entity7 said @entity1 intervened unilaterally at 10:25 a.m. it was the third intervention this year
" foreign exchange rates should reflect the real economy and fluctuate within the range of common sense
otherwise it will distort the real economy , " @entity13 said
" i decided it ( the intervention ) this morning as i can not tolerate such appreciation
" the yen went up to the post-war high of 75.32 per dollar early monday
the intervention immediately sent it tumbling to 79 per dollar
the government is worried that a strengthened yen will impact its economy , which relies heavily on exports
the country has only now begun to recover from the devastating aftereffects of a march 11 earthquake and tsunami
" the yen 's appreciation might close down factories and i can not tolerate it , " @entity13 said
for every 1 yen appreciation against the dollar , @entity32 , the car manufacturer , loses 30 billion yen ( $ 380 million ) in profits
the stock market , however , lost the upward momentum after an initial 100 - point gain as some analysts expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the intervention
" the question is how long will the effect of the intervention continue , " said @entity43 , a senior strategist of @entity44
" the market is looking at the past examples
if this is a one - time only , the effect would be limited
it all depends how far the government is ready to intervene
it 's a battle between the market and the government
