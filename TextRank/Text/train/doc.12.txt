@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the question of whether recent immigrants assimilate as quickly as previous waves , many @entity3 exhibit short fuses -- and even shorter memories
@entity9 notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating
they have convinced themselves that , instead of adapting to the customs of this country , new arrivals -- most of whom come from @entity18 or @entity19 -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them
they go ballistic over little things -- @entity26 flags , taco trucks , libraries that offer bilingual story time , or having to " press one for @entity31
" yet , even as they look down on new immigrants , many @entity3 look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors
legend has it that when grandpa arrived from @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 or @entity40 , he jumped off the boat , immediately draped himself in the @entity3 flag , ripped out his native tongue , and abandoned his culture -- all while singing " @entity45
" @entity38 did not move to @entity46 and make beer and cheese
the @entity49 did not settle in @entity50 and join organizations like the @entity52 to preserve their heritage and culture
and even while @entity3 complain about how the current crop of immigrants are n't like their predecessors , they miss the irony : at the time , there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors ; the @entity38 were thought to not be like the @entity31 , the @entity49 were n't like the @entity38 , the @entity39 were n't like the @entity49 etc. and the @entity64 were n't like anyone who had come before them , and so they were labeled " unassimilable " by the @entity66 of that era
when i was growing up in @entity1 , which is home to a large population of immigrants from @entity18 , thousands would gather to celebrate @entity72
the local newspaper would do a feature
and , in the days that followed , someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people were n't melting into the pot. yet , there is more melting going on than one might think , according to a new report from the @entity84
billed as the first annual index of @entity87 , the study was written by @entity89 professor @entity88
it measured three kinds of assimilation : economic ( employment , education , homeownership , etc. ) ; cultural ( intermarriage , @entity31 proficiency , family size , etc. ) ; and civic ( citizenship , military service , political participation , etc. )
far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process , the study found that " immigrants of the past quarter - century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago , even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival
" of course , individual groups still fall behind in some categories
@entity64 and @entity112 immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation
@entity26 immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation
and @entity119 and @entity112 immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation , since few of them become citizens
but , overall , the news is good
after more than 200 years , @entity19 still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants
even if a particular group tried to resist the process , they would n't stand a chance
assimilation happens , whether the immigrants are ready or not
of course , fear does n't listen to facts
that is something else that has n't changed
