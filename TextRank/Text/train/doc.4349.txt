@entity0 , @entity1 -- an activist monk detained by @entity1 authorities friday was freed hours later after being questioned at a military base in @entity0 , a fellow monk said saturday
@entity7 was taken away from a monastery in @entity0 by about 10 men in plainclothes who said they were from the " @entity12 , " said @entity13 , a monk who witnessed the events
his detainment occurred only weeks after he was released from years of imprisonment
he was released again friday night after being questioned at the military headquarters in @entity0 about his personal and family information , according to @entity20 , another monk at the @entity0 monastery
the detention of @entity7 comes after the @entity1 government has taken notable steps to improve its human rights record
in recent weeks , the regime has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners , approved the participation of the pro-democracy leader @entity28 and her party in april elections , and pledged to pursue a peace deal with an ethnic rebel group
@entity34 governments have applauded the effort , with the @entity36 announcing in january that it would exchange ambassadors with @entity1 for the first time since 1988
that came after a visit to the country last month by secretary of state @entity42 , the first top @entity36 diplomat in the nation in more than five decades
@entity7 was one of the leaders of anti-government demonstrations that rallied tens of thousands of people in 2007
the @entity1 authorities cracked down on the demonstrations , clubbing and gassing protesters and arresting as many as 200 monks
he was released last month with other political prisoners
@entity13 said he believed the reason @entity7 had been taken away friday may be related to a recent effort by @entity7 to break into his old monastery , which was locked after the 2007 protests
@entity2 's @entity55 contributed to this report .
