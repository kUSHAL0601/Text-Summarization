-- the tech world 's getting used to the idea @entity3 is absent from @entity4 again , for medical reasons
we think he 'll be back soon
but one day he wo n't come back , and who might fill the big chair then ? for the time being @entity11 is in control at @entity4 , as he has been every time @entity3 has had to take time to tackle his health issues
@entity11 's time in the role has , self - evidently , been highly successful , and many commenters are tipping him to be @entity3 's eventual successor -- with these stand - in periods acting as a carefully managed succession plan
but is @entity11 really the guy for the job , given that @entity3 is still active as ceo in the background , and all big decisions are still cycling through him ? could someone else from inside @entity4 be a better fit , or is there someone working elsewhere we can imagine as the next @entity4 ceo ? @entity11 currently @entity4 coo , repeat stand - in for @entity3
demanding , keen - minded , unemotional
a science and business scholar , previously at @entity35 and 12 years at @entity36 where he managed product and manufacturing inventories and chains
he 's credited with making @entity4 's products stream reliably from their eastern manufacturing homes to their end users , and hot - tipped to replace @entity3 by many
recently introduced the high - profile @entity46
once said : " replace @entity3 ? no , he 's irreplaceable
that 's something people have to get over
" odds for replacing @entity3 : @entity52 , long , long
a good temporary replacement , but lacks dynamism and creative vision
@entity56 currently senior vp of @entity58 at @entity4
highly regarded , award - winning brains behind nearly all of @entity4 's iconic computing and mobile products since 1996 -- starting with the industry - startling original candy - color @entity62 , and recently refining the aluminum unibody designs that are now a design reference point
a highly accomplished presenter and speaker , he 's known as a perfectionist and thinks focus groups are a symptom of corporate " creative bankruptcy
" odds for replacing @entity3 : medium - long , as though he 's a super-hot property in the design field , and some of his philosophy aligns with @entity3 ' , he lacks the industrial and technical training to replace his boss
he could be a powerful co-chair , though
@entity81 currently senior vp of @entity83 at @entity4
a 20 - year @entity4 veteran , in different marketing management roles , he 's credited with some of the smart moves that placed @entity62 , ipods , and iphones as the chic devices to own in the public 's eye
he often speaks at @entity3 - led keynote speeches , and has led a keynote or two of his own to introduce new products
not regarded as a business tiger , he does @entity96 , and has spoken clearly about what makes @entity4 products unique : " we want things to be beautiful , surprising to see , but they also have to be functional
one without the other does n't make any sense
" odds for replacing @entity3 : medium
he has definite genius in marketing , and shares much of @entity3 ' product vision
but he does n't have a dynamic public presence , and some see him as a bad ceo -- probably better suited at staying where he is , to support any future new ceo and ensure consistency
@entity112 currently senior vp @entity113 at @entity4
@entity112 is responsible for some of the key decisions behind @entity4 's @entity117 and its @entity119 interface , and led the release of @entity121
a computer scientist by training , and formerly an employee of @entity3 ' @entity126 computer firm , @entity112 reports directly to @entity3 and is credited with the successful industry - defining @entity128 interface of the @entity46 and @entity130
he 's a smooth public speaker and has notable attention to detail : " i actually have a photographer 's loupe that i use to make sure every pixel is right " odds for replacing @entity3 : good
@entity137 called him a name you " need to know in 2011 , " and he 's young , possesses the right kind of technical knowledge and dynamism , and has become an increasingly important figure in key @entity4 product decisions
@entity145 currently executive chairman of @entity147 , formerly ceo
educated in electrical engineering , he has a phd and taught at @entity150 as a part - time professor
joined @entity147 in 2001 , swiftly adopted the ceo role as a business - savvy figurehead in place to manage the tech - minded , but less business - savvy @entity156 and @entity158
he stepped aside from this role in 2011 , and will now advise ceo page from a board level
@entity145 served on @entity4 's board from 2006 to 2009 , but left due to conflict of interests with @entity147
a slick public speaker , @entity145 is however famous for making oral slip - ups that damaged @entity147 's reputation , including " we know where you 've been
we can more or less know what you 're thinking about
" odds for replacing @entity3 : medium
he has stepped back from the hot seat at @entity147 , and could easily depart its board which could resolve some conflicts of interest with @entity4
he is highly business - minded , technically educated , but lacks @entity3 ' slickness and ( possibly ) creative vision
would he do it , though ? @entity183 currently retired , retained as a " special advisor " to @entity3 at @entity4
@entity183 is a computer science engineer , formerly ceo of @entity187 and employee at @entity4 spin - off @entity189 and @entity191
joined @entity4 in 2001 as a contractor advising on @entity194 design , then was quickly hired to its @entity194 and @entity196 group , a group he ran as @entity197 from 2006 after @entity199 's departure
retired in 2008 , at the same time as his wife @entity200 ( vp of @entity201 at @entity4 ) to concentrate on his family
on retiring he noted " i 'm determined to tell my kids and grandkids amazing stories beyond my @entity194 and @entity46 ones
" odds for replacing @entity3 : unknown
he made a bold decision to spend time with his family , but retained a key role advising his former boss jobs
he has the right technical skills and creative imagination and is certainly trusted by @entity3 , but could he be tempted back for a couple of years for the right eight - figure salary ? @entity216 currently vp in @entity218 at @entity219
he is educated in electronics and worked at @entity36 for 26 years , including senior roles in the powerpc chip project -- the chips that , at the time , powered @entity4 's computer lineup
highly regarded in the industry , @entity4 tried to recruit him in 2007 , but did n't find him a fit for the role in question
after @entity183 left , @entity216 was recruited in late 2008 to help integrate @entity4 's recent chip design acquisitions
a controversial battle with @entity36 occurred , concerning @entity216 's intense inside knowledge of @entity36 's tech , and though this was resolved he left @entity4 in late 2010 due to the @entity235 antenna woes and broader " cultural " differences
odds for replacing @entity3 : it 's very unlikely to happen
unless @entity4 's @entity239 decides @entity216 's technical expertise and dynamism are crucial to develop the internally produced chips that @entity4 is increasingly relying on for its signature products
a possible co-ceo ? @entity246 currently vp of @entity248 and @entity249 at @entity250
@entity246 has an @entity251 in product design from @entity150 , but is most famously known as the man behind @entity256 's revolutionary @entity255 phone -- the last - ditch effort by @entity256 to remain relevant in a @entity259 world
he left his vp of @entity262 role @entity256 after its acquisition by @entity264 and joined @entity250 in late 2010
speaking about his area of expertise since joining @entity250 , @entity246 noted " design is just 5 % of a world class product and experience
marketing , sales , distribution , [ and ] procurement is what makes up the other 95 %
" odds for replacing @entity3 : long in the short term , good in the future
@entity246 certainly has the right criteria for the @entity4 ceo role , understanding technical matters , design principles , marketing roles and management issues
he 's unlikely to leave @entity250 soon , and who knows if he 'd be tempted to join @entity4 , but he 's the right stuff
