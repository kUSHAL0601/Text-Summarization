the @entity2 @entity1 's most senior member is ready to support president @entity4 's attorney general nominee , @entity5 attorney @entity3
@entity6 , a high - ranking member of the upper chamber 's judiciary committee , spoke to reporters tuesday on @entity10 about @entity3 's credentials and @entity1 's desire to see @entity13 , the current attorney general , leave office
" she appears to be a very top - flight person , " he said
" and if conservatives do want to get rid of the attorney general , this is a good option because she would replace him and do a very a good job
" @entity13 is one of the more controversial members of the @entity4 cabinet
seen as overly partisan by @entity1 , the @entity24 voted to hold him in contempt of @entity26 in 2012 for refusing to turn over documents linked to @entity28
the announcement of his resignation in september was welcome by those opponents
@entity3 , the @entity5 attorney for the @entity34 , was nominated by @entity4 last month to replace @entity13 , who has served as head of the @entity36 since the beginning of the @entity4 administration
she 's easily passed through the @entity2 twice for her nominations as a federal prosecutor
" i can think of no better public servant to be our next attorney general , " the president said when he nominated @entity3
" it 's my hope that the @entity2 will confirm her for a third time without delay
" at 55 years old , she will be the first @entity48 - @entity5 woman to serve as attorney general if confirmed
@entity6 's support is critical to get through the judiciary committee and the entire @entity2 , both of which will be controlled by @entity1 when @entity26 resumes next year
he did note that he has n't met with the nominee yet
" i guess i 'm not important enough , " @entity6 , who has chaired the committee multiple times over the past 20 years , joked
unconcerned she has n't come by yet , he expects to meet with her before her nomination hearings as traditionally done with most committee members
" i 'm somebody who wants to support the president on these matters , " @entity6 said
" i think probably she feels like she 's had a lot of people she needs to meet with right off the bat
and that 's fine with me
" the senior @entity1 from @entity67 has a history of supporting presidents ' judicial nominees of both parties
he voted for both @entity74 presidents @entity72 and @entity4 's attorneys general , @entity76 and @entity13
his support for @entity13 , though , has waned
" i happen to think the attorney general has not done a great job , but i like him personally a lot , " @entity6 said
presented with the new option , he noted in his amicable , and perhaps slightly eager , tone that @entity3 's nomination " looks pretty good to me
