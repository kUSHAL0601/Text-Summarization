-- not only is @entity1 the greatest ever @entity2 ballet dancer , he is one of the best the world has ever seen
his athletic grace has won him fans wherever he has performed , and his dedication to the art continues to bring ballet to new audiences
capable of soaring leaps and flawless turns , @entity10 has thrilled audiences the world over
founded in 1998 , his k - ballet company has built on the success he acheived at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20
born in @entity21 on @entity22 -- @entity2 's @entity23 -- in 1972 , @entity1 took up ballet after seeing his eight year - old cousin , @entity26 perform at school in @entity21
like any 10 year old boy , his new hobby had to compete with other activities -- he also enjoyed kendo , baseball and drawing -- but it was ballet that he really fell in love with
from a young age @entity1 had been keen to see the world and the arrival of foreign guest tutors at his school only reinforced those desires
but it was @entity45 ballet teacher @entity44 's visit to @entity22 that proved to be a turning point in @entity1 's nascent career
@entity44 encouraged him to travel and recommended that he attend the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) in @entity20 or the @entity50
@entity1 was just 15 years old when he left home to take up a place at the @entity49
less than two years later , in january 1989 , he won both the @entity53 and the newly established prince @entity54 at the prestigious @entity55 in @entity45
he was without question the star of the competition , producing soaring leaps in a performance from ' @entity61 '
in the spring of 1989 he turned professional , becoming the first @entity63 dancer to join the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) -- his first solo part was the leading mandolin player in " @entity67
" in june he won the @entity68 at the @entity70 competition held in @entity71
@entity1 experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks of the @entity64
he quickly became a @entity74 , dancing the @entity75 in @entity77 's ' @entity76 ' and completed a memorable performance as the @entity79 in @entity80 -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability
the following season he was chosen for the role of the @entity84 in the premiere of @entity87 's ' the prince and the @entity88 '
in 1991 he was promoted to @entity74 and was a principal dancer by 1993
so developed a mutual love affair between @entity1 , his new fans and his adoptive city
" i was so pleased to participate in @entity95 culture , " he told the @entity93 in 2004
by the age of @entity99 ' , as he had become known to his friends in the @entity95 -- ' kuma ' means ' bear ' in @entity2 -- had danced the full repertoire of classical and modern roles at the @entity64
the man who had wowed @entity20 audiences with his acrobatic jumps and audacious turns was about to leap into a new chapter of his life
in 1998 he left the @entity18 to found his own company -- the @entity109 -- back home in @entity111
it was a highly controversial move at the time
not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season , he also took five of the @entity18 's star male performers with him to @entity2
the @entity118 and the ballet fraternity were not impressed
greeted as a returning hero in his native country , @entity1 took on the roles of leading dancer , teacher , artistic director and company manager simultaneously
but despite the formidable workload and responsibility the new @entity109 flourished , fostering a wider interest in @entity2 ballet
in 2004 , @entity1 established the @entity131
the same year , the @entity109 became the first @entity2 ballet company to perform at the @entity133 in @entity134
a career - threatening knee injury , suffered whilst on a @entity109 tour of @entity2 in may 2007 has temporarily sidelined @entity1 from performing
but he expects to be back on stage next year , delighting audiences with virtuoso performances once again
in the meantime , @entity1 -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in @entity2 -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers
