@entity0 -- cleanup was under way sunday on damage to bus stops and outdoor cafes in central @entity0 , after austerity protests turned violent saturday night in the @entity9 capital and left 101 people injured
the injured included 67 national and municipal police officers and 34 demonstrators
@entity18 were taken to hospitals , including a national police officer who was kicked in the head , lost his riot helmet and lost consciousness , spokesmen for the central and @entity0 city governments said
the 24 demonstrators , including three minors , who were arrested face potential charges of assaulting police officers , vandalism , and setting trash bins on fire
arraignments could begin later sunday
city street crews and other workers were carrying out the cleanup as authorities evaluated the damage
as has become a pattern at many @entity9 protests , the violence came only at the very end of what had been hours of peaceful , noisy and energetic protests
the so - called " @entity51 " was the first major anti-austerity demonstration in @entity0 in several months , aimed at telling the government that there is still widespread suffering in @entity9 despite official pronouncements that the beleaguered economy is recovering

hundreds of protesters in six columns from around @entity9 have been marching for weeks on the capital to draw attention to the situation
on saturday , they reached @entity0 and were joined by tens of thousands of protesters , who converged along the capital 's main boulevard from the @entity68 train station to @entity69 , where a stage was erected for speakers
it was near the stage , at the end of the march , that the violence erupted after the official close of the demonstration at 8 p.m. local time , even as many protesters were already leaving the area to find transportation home
there have been hundreds of protests in @entity0 -- by teachers , doctors and other specific groups -- against the government 's austerity measures , aimed at reducing the budget deficit
but the march on saturday tried to include all of these groups under a broad " @entity51 " banner
