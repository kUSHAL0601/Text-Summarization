@entity0 -- a @entity3 man left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago lost his @entity7 battle thursday to gain a legal right to end his life when he chooses
@entity11 's condition means it is impossible for him to take his own life -- and he wants the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution
since he suffered the stroke in 2005 , the former rugby player , now 58 , has had to endure what is known as locked - in syndrome
" this means that most of my body is paralyzed but my mind is as it was before the stroke
all i can move is my head , and the stroke took away my power of speech
now i talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks , " he told @entity1 in an interview in june
but while expressing sympathy for his situation , the @entity7 ruled thursday that such a significant change to the law -- involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia -- would have to be decided by lawmakers
the judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering locked - in syndrome , named only as @entity50
" @entity53 recognised that the cases raise profoundly difficult ethical , social and legal issues , but it judged that any change to the law must be a matter for @entity58 to decide , " a statement from the court said
the ruling upset @entity11 , who cried as his wife , @entity59 , told the waiting media that the family was " bitterly disappointed " and would file an appeal
in the meantime , her husband will have to continue living as he is , or starve himself to death , she said
in a statement given via his computer , @entity11 said : " it 's not the result i was hoping for but it is n't entirely unexpected
judges , like politicians , are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgement is not an exception to the rule
" i believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort , misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life -- me or the state
" his daughters , tweeting on his behalf thursday , urged people to sign a petition via his @entity91 account supporting his " right to die with dignity
" within hours , more than 2,200 people had added their name
@entity95 said the family did not intend to go to @entity97 , which has an assisted suicide law , because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die
she and their two daughters fully support his battle in the @entity3 courts , which has already lasted several years
speaking to @entity1 in june , @entity95 described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the " life and soul of the party , " making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear
" he was a big bloke , ex-rugby player , he worked hard but he played hard
he was full of life , great sense of humor , loved the sound of his own voice , " she said
and she said she wanted the judges to understand " the injustice of it all , " as they considered his case
" you or i could go out and take our lives at any time we want , whereas @entity11 , being the one who really needs that right , ca n't do this -- and he 's only asking for what everyone else has got really , his right to take his own life , he wants that given back to him , " she said
before his stroke at age 51 , the couple lived a comfortable life in the @entity134 and traveled extensively
@entity11 was a senior manager with a @entity136 civil engineering contractor , a job he enjoyed , and was chairman of the local sports club
although he does not necessarily want to end his life straight away , he is frustrated by the indignity and tedium of his current condition , which has n't changed for seven years and which doctors say could continue for years
" some people have in the past spoken to me in the loud , slow and deliberate tones normally reserved for the deaf or daft
i am neither , " he said
" all too often , well - meaning able - bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide , he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice
" i say that where a person has the mental ability , he should have the choice of his own life or death
the only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life
" @entity11 has embraced @entity91 as a way to communicate his views to the world and has more than 40,000 followers
he describes himself , with wry humor , as a " @entity91 novice with locked - in syndrome dribbling his way to an uncertain future
" but asked if social networking service had made a difference to his quality of life , he said he views it " as a means to an end , not an end in itself
life is too painful for too many reasons for @entity91 to make a significant difference
" @entity11 does not believe it unfair to ask doctors to end life , one of the arguments against a change in the law , saying it is not uncommon for doctors to make such decisions already in the course of their career
" doctors pledge to save life and to relieve suffering wherever possible
if it 's necessary to end a patient 's life to relieve someone 's suffering , tough
doctors ca n't pick and choose which bits they will do and which bits they wo n't -- they signed up for the whole package , " he said
" there is too much emphasis on saving life at all costs and not enough thought given by society to the quality of the life saved
i am not advocating that doctors make the life or death decision at the time but the patient should be given the option of assisted dying , if he requires help
" lawyer @entity223 , who is acting for @entity11 , said ahead of thursday 's ruling that it would involve a " very significant change in the law " since there is no legal precedent in the @entity3
she said that @entity11 would be devastated if the ruling went against him , but that he is a " fighter " who would want to carry on the legal battle against what he sees as discrimination on the grounds of disability
the @entity238 had opposed a change in the law
@entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .
