-- hundreds of people were being evacuated from their homes in @entity3 after a levee was breached monday night
officials in @entity8 near @entity9 activated warning sirens after the levee broke , a statement from the county said
earlier monday , a bridge connecting @entity13 , @entity3 , and @entity14 , @entity15 , was shutdown after a temporary flood barricade gave way
forecasters say there could be major flooding tuesday
the @entity22 at @entity9 was 10.1 feet above flood stage monday night , according to the @entity25 website
flood warnings and advisories were in effect from counties in northern @entity15 down to @entity30
as authorities dealt with rising water in @entity3 and @entity15 , officials in @entity32 wrapped up another day of looking for people who remained missing after last week 's tornadoes and heavy rain
the fate of the five missing people remains uncertain , officials said
searchers found the body of an 8 - year - old girl monday afternoon , @entity42 deputy fire chief @entity41 said
she drowned in the @entity47
at least 18 people died in the storm , authorities said monday
among them were four people who died saturday in separate drowning incidents , according to officials
also killed were seven members of an extended family from @entity57 -- including four children -- who died when they were swept away by rains after hiding from the approaching weather in a storm drain
the flash flooding swept some bodies up to 5 miles downstream , @entity63 said
the family grew panicked when they saw reports of tornadoes and sought shelter in the storm drain , a 7 - foot drop from their property , which , in the end , was not hit by high winds
but suddenly the water in the drain rose quickly
the high , powerful water hurled them through the dark concrete tunnel
the brother of one of the women who died said , " i have an emptiness in my heart because i 've lost my sister
" @entity88 and friends searched a muddy creek monday looking for an eighth body
other deaths came in wake of storm in eastern @entity98 , a 65 - year - old man on his way to work was killed early saturday when he drove off a washed out bridge and drowned in a creek
three others who died were storm chasers : @entity103 , his son @entity103 and @entity104
the damage was n't confined to @entity32
in @entity3 , a twister left more than 10 miles of significant damage " that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up , " gov. @entity106 told @entity0 affiliate @entity111
no one was killed in that tornado , but three people drowned in @entity3 , @entity106 said
and in @entity115 , flooding killed at least four people : a sheriff 's deputy , a wildlife officer and two women they were trying to save from a deluged home
' memories just tossed about ' but it was @entity42 and its surrounding areas that sustained most of the damage
the storm system mowed down power lines and uprooted trees , flipped big rigs on their sides and ripped off part of the terminal roof at @entity42 's @entity132 , where some 1,500 area residents had taken shelter in a tunnel
the twisters tore open brick houses like cartons , sucking out their contents and tossing them out onto lawns
" it 's a sombering thing to think about life and to see all your memories just tossed about , " @entity141 said as he surveyed the damage at his parents ' house
" everything from your childhood on up
" though friday 's tornadoes were not as strong as the @entity155 twister that killed 24 people on may 20 , fear drove some people to flee in cars , ignoring warnings not to drive
some drove on the wrong side of the highway
interstates turned into parking lots
' we were overwhelmed ' once the tornadoes passed , @entity166 faced a new threat : floods
eight to 11 inches of rain hosed @entity42 , stranding motorists and hitting apartments in low - lying areas of town hard
" we saw flooding in areas that we do n't see flooding , " said police lt. @entity175
" the @entity180 said there was a possibility of severe storms in central @entity32 on tuesday night that could bring large hail , damaging wind and localized flooding
@entity0 's @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .
