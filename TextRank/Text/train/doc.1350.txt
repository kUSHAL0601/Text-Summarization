-- at a time of heightened tensions in the @entity4 , the @entity1 has been forced to temporarily abandon the requirement to keep two aircraft carriers in the @entity7 because of unusual maintenance problems
the @entity9 was expected to deploy to the @entity7 early next year , but it will not leave because of extensive repairs on a failed propulsion pump
it may be deployed in spring 2013
at the same time , the @entity13 is being sent home immediately for repairs to its flight deck
it will remain in @entity19 , @entity20 , for two months and then return to the @entity4 early next year to complete its deployment
the @entity1 plans to send the @entity22 to the region early next year to restore the two - carrier presence
the @entity25 is already in the area
@entity27 considers boosting presence in @entity29
