-- the @entity2 headline said it all : " rep. @entity4 fails to close @entity5
" when this became @entity4 's job , or whether his now " controversial " @entity9 op - ed was even an attempt at doing that , is anyone 's guess
but once again , @entity14 have decided to cannibalize themselves viciously and needlessly instead of uniting over common goals
to be clear , the divide on the right is n't over policy
no @entity5 i 've met thinks @entity20 is good legislation
no one is suggesting capitulation on the debt ceiling
everyone wants spending cuts , entitlement reform and deficit reduction
where we 're divided is over tactics
incidentally , @entity4 hinted at this in september to @entity32 : " yeah , there 's a bit of frustration
... we all believe the same thing , we all want to achieve the same goal , and so we should n't be questioning each other 's conservatism over tactical disagreements
" guess no one on team @entity41 got that message
after @entity4 's op - ed , which pushed for a strong - willed fight for entitlement reform in exchange for raising the debt ceiling , failed to mention the unholiest of @entity51 holies , @entity20 , he was nailed to a proverbial cross by @entity41 defenders , who then immediately told everyone at @entity55 -- or on @entity56 -- of his betrayal
@entity41 speechwriter @entity58 tweeted , " there is one big word missing from this op - ed. it 's start ( sic ) with an o and ends with @entity62
" @entity64 spokesman @entity63 was similarly snarky : " much like @entity66 press , @entity4 does n't mention @entity20 in @entity9 oped
" over on @entity70 , @entity69 posted the questions , " so we are going to ditch the fight over @entity20 , which is extremely unpopular , to fight for @entity74 reform ? really , @entity4 ? and they think we are politically stupid ? " now , nowhere in @entity4 's op - ed does he suggest ditching the fight over @entity20
as @entity41 's cheerleaders point out , @entity4 does n't even mention the health care law
but the thing that defies logic ( and good manners ) is the necessity of this kind of puerile bullying
@entity4 's plan is n't in competition with or heretical to @entity41 's message
it 's simply another objective conservatives should fight for , both in the short term and the long term
furthermore , the sniping is just unseemly , and frankly , @entity41 's defenders are only managing to make @entity4 look like the grown - up
i do n't recall @entity4 jumping into the fray when plenty of @entity14 were criticizing the strategy to defund @entity20 -- a position by @entity41 that i have applauded as heroic
when sens. @entity99 and @entity100 and rep. @entity101 were scolding @entity41 for a plan they knew was ill - fated , @entity4 was virtually silent on the move
this , even though @entity41 has never been shy about his disdain for @entity14
back in march , @entity41 criticized @entity4 's budget plan for its @entity74 cuts
and he 's made it clear he does n't trust @entity109 when it comes to budget negotiations
it 's hard to argue that @entity4 is n't a staunch conservative
to treat him like a traitor is preposterous and unproductive
and while i admire @entity41 's conviction , and stand by his commitment to peel back a program as odious and ruinous as the @entity20 , he has to learn to work with others on his own team
the @entity2 headline is n't accurate
instead of reading " rep. @entity4 fails to close @entity123 divide " it should read " @entity125 republicans apart
" if he keeps it up , he 'll lose people like me who are with him on the policy , but quickly losing patience for his tactics
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .
