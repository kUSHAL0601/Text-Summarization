health officials around the world hailed the decision by @entity4 's high court , which stubbed out claims by tobacco companies that the packaging of cigarettes without branding was unconstitutional
the @entity4 decision raises the hopes of anti-tobacco forces of similar moves in other nations
" we are elated with this victory , " said @entity15 , director of the @entity16
" we also draw inspiration from the @entity4 government for standing up against the challenges from the tobacco industry and all its artillery for trying to block this move -- and winning
this win for @entity4 prepares the path for the @entity27 ( @entity27 )
" opinion : @entity4 tobacco packaging laws misguided " with @entity4 's victory , public health enters a brave new world of tobacco control , " said dr. @entity30 , director - general of the @entity31
" plain packaging is a highly effective way to counter industry 's ruthless marketing tactics
" tobacco products in @entity4 must be in plain packaging without logos and have graphic health warnings as of december 1
it 's the latest move in a global trend toward packing that shows diseased organs , dying patients , skin lesions or other medical maladies caused by smoking
@entity4 : ruling shows ' big tobacco can be taken on and beaten ' @entity55 was the first nation to pass legislation requiring a graphic health warning in 2001 -- 41 nations have since followed suit
@entity55 and 18 other nations require at least 50 % of the packaging to contain health warnings
until the @entity4 decision , the nation that required the most prominent warning was @entity65 , where 80 % of packages contain graphic health advisories
tobacco companies said the @entity4 ruling -- which would eliminate iconic branding from appearing on the package -- would raise the amount of counterfeit products on the market , eroding government taxes collected on tobacco
more : should smoking trigger an r rating ? last year the @entity78 unveiled nine graphic health warning labels that must cover half the area of cigarette packages by this september .
