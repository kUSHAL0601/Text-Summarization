nearly nine out of 10 people " stopped and frisked " under a controversial @entity1 policy in 2011 were @entity3 or @entity4
the data comes from a report released by the @entity1 monday , which showed that of the 685,724 stops made by police that year , 53 % of those questioned were black , 34 % were @entity10 , 9 % were white and 3 % were @entity11
the citywide population in 2011 was 23.4 % black , 29.4 % @entity4 , 12.9 % @entity11 , and 34.3 % non-hispanic white , according to the report
@entity16 judge halts ' stop - and - frisk ' tactic outside @entity20 building @entity22 's 75th precinct , which includes @entity23 and @entity24 , had the most " stop and frisk " incidents with 31,100
of those , 97 % of the people involved were either black or @entity4
the population in that precinct in 2011 was 53.5 % black , 37.9 % @entity4 , 5.1 % @entity11 , and 3.5 % white
the top reason for stop - and - frisks in 2011 was for suspicion of weapons possession , accounting for more than 25 % of all stops
the much - criticized method , in which police stop , question and possibly search those they consider suspicious , is used to deter crime , the police department has said
but it has also brought on a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops
last year , amid mounting public pressure from advocacy groups , @entity23 police commissioner @entity45 outlined new police policies in an effort to " increase public confidence
" @entity23 police tout improving crime numbers to defend frisking policy under the policies , officers report all " stop and frisk " encounters at a local level , and are provided training curriculum and videos , @entity45 said
there are also programs reaching out to the community , he said
@entity45 said at the time that the department prohibits racial profiling and aims to ensure a " greater level of scrutiny " by having captains of precincts " personally conducting an audit of the @entity69 report worksheets that have been prepared within his or her command
" the @entity1 report did not list how many of the stop - and - frisks resulted in arrests .
