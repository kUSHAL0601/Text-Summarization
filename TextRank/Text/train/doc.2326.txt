the @entity35 was the first ship to arrive on the scene , and monitored the hijacked vessel until the @entity9 ship @entity40 arrived with a boarding team , lt. @entity34 of @entity16 told @entity0
the pirates threw their weapons into the sea as the boarding team closed in , and stood on deck to surrender once they boarded , @entity34 said
