-- a group of friends got lucky when they bought a winning @entity4 ticket at a @entity6 - area porn shop
@entity7 claimed the $ 128.6 million prize on friday , on behalf of a group of southeastern @entity11 residents that he dubbed " @entity14
" at a press conference in @entity16 , @entity11 , @entity7 would n't answer questions as to who purchased the ticket at @entity20 in @entity21 , or why they were at the store in the first place
" nobody cares , " said @entity7
@entity20 , an adult novelty store a few miles north of @entity6 that also rents pornographic videos , will get $ 50,000 from lottery officials for selling the winning ticket
it shares a building with the @entity32 strip club
at the same press conference , @entity33 laid claim to a winning $ 141 million @entity37 prize
@entity33 , who said he 's been retired the past 10 years , said it was " to be determined " what he 'd do with his jackpot
he opted for the annuity plan , spreading out his winnings over 26 years , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity43
team @entity14 , on the other hand , opted for a lump sum payout of $ 69.6 million before taxes
@entity7 said that the winners planned to give some of their money to an unnamed local church , " and maybe fix some things around the house
" " the prize is a blessing , " said @entity7 , who did not divulge how many people would share the prize
" we were in shock
like i told my family , everything has changed , but nothing has changed
" friday 's dual announcement marked the largest single - day payout since the @entity64 began 38 years ago , and the first time that a single state lottery has had @entity4 and @entity37 winners so close together , according to the @entity64 .
