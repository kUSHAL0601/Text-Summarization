november is the month we celebrate @entity2 in the @entity3
in @entity5 , there is a different type of celebration
it turns out that all tax returns of every @entity10 are made public this month , which leads to a " media frenzy of gossip , boasting and finger - pointing about who has paid their fair share in income tax , " according to an article on @entity17
good times for all , it would seem , in the small @entity21 country widely praised for its generous social welfare policies
well , not quite for all
take banker @entity24 , one of the richest @entity5
he moved to @entity25 of all places earlier this year to avoid the high tax rates in his homeland
the average income tax rate in @entity5 fell from 37.5 % in the 1990s to around 30 % in the 2000s , and is now rising , set to hit 31.1 % next year
in the @entity3 in contrast , the average tax rate in 2010 was 11.81 % , according to a study published by the non-partisan @entity35
another study shows that in 2014 , 95 % of @entity3 paid an effective income tax rate under 10 % ; the top 1 % of income earners reached an average of 24.6 % , still significantly below the average tax rate for all taxpaying @entity5
so what would happen if @entity3 had a " @entity43 " like @entity5 , and tax returns of every citizen were all released in one fell swoop to unleash a media frenzy ? it is hard to predict counter-factual history , of course , beyond stating the obvious -- it ai n't going to happen , ever
even the most zealous foes of privacy when it comes to terrorists and other outcasts seem firmly committed to privacy of tax returns
do n't tread on me -- and do n't look at my 1040 -- seem equally sacred principles in the @entity3
but putting reality aside for a moment , what is my best guess as to what would happen if @entity3 went the @entity5 way ? nothing
nothing has been happening a lot lately
according to the online @entity69 , the saying that " the more things change , the more they stay the same " is a proverb " making the observation that turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo
" we certainly have seen a lot of turbulent changes
consider the situation in 2008 : the @entity3 was facing a @entity86 , a worldwide credit crisis exacerbated by sketchy lending policies , not to mention two major wars ( @entity89 and @entity90 ) , each part of a broader war against terrorism , sovereign debt crises around the globe ( @entity81 , @entity82 , more ) and mounting fiscal deficits at home
the turbulence led to the election of @entity96 , our first @entity97 - @entity3 president , a @entity98 , and something of a liberal to boot
so what happened to tax policy , which might be thought to play a starring role as both cause and effect of the drama ? well , pretty much , nothing
it was not until the early hours of 2013 that we saw any changes to the income tax at all , and these were mainly to add a few percentage points to the rate bracket in which a handful of the highest earners found themselves -- those couples earning more than $ 450,000 a year
earlier this year , the @entity121 economist @entity120 saw his monumental work " @entity123 " translated into @entity124 and promptly rocket up all kinds of bestseller lists
@entity120 's volume tells the tale of how the @entity3 , in particular , is approaching the highest levels of wealth and income inequality in recorded history
and what has been the policy response to @entity120 's prognosis ? well , again , nothing , unless you consider a return to a @entity141 @entity140 , and a fully divided government , something
( in fact , that is the ideal structure in which nothing gets done , hence it makes stock markets happy
) then there is the fact that when we do disclose tax returns in the @entity3 , nothing much happens
presidential candidates tend to do this
when they do not , or just release summaries , nothing much happens
from the disclosures , we learn that @entity159 was not very wealthy , but @entity160 is , and life pretty much goes on -- with some wailing and gnashing of teeth among tax cognoscenti over such odd tidbits as the fact that @entity160 was able to amass more than $ 100 million in a @entity168
the tax policy impact ? well , nothing
there was also the much ballyhooed self - disclosure of @entity174 's 2010 tax returns , leading to a proposal for a " @entity176 , " a flat 30 % effective tax rate on millionaires -- still lower than the average @entity5 tax rate
what happened there ? well , nothing , again
so , how about it ? could we force all tax returns in the @entity3 to be made public so that we could have a " media frenzy of gossip , boasting and finger - pointing " too ? well , no and no. no , it ai n't going to happen and no , it would not lead to that result
not here , not now
no doubt , tax compliance might improve , by means of shame if nothing else , and perhaps some entrepreneurs would even find a way to make some money by " whistleblowing " on tax crimes and misdemeanors they unearthed from the massive data dump
yet being @entity3 , publicly disclosed tax returns would more likely lead to an assault from financial advisors offering their services to help the rich lower their taxes
just think -- who would not want a $ 100 million @entity168 ? taxes could thus even go down , as the tax - avoidance - industry found new targets , with fees to these helpful souls going up
@entity215 in 21st century @entity3 are different than those in @entity5 , a nation with a population about the size of @entity219
we have gotten pretty much inured to indifference about levels of wealth and income inequality unimaginable to people from other times and places
the details simply bore us
our media frenzies and gossip are about other pressing matters
in fact , i have to run ; i have to find out just what 's going on with @entity234 and @entity235 , and i have yet to see the latest @entity237 photos
