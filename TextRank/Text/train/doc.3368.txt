-- at 32 years old @entity1 is president of cancer - support charity the @entity3
he has also survived three separate cases of cancer
in august 1996 , @entity1 was a 19 - year - old college soccer player when a @entity7 scan revealed a shadow behind his heart
doctors said there was only a slim chance he had cancer , but he needed surgery
during the operation , @entity1 had an allergic reaction to the morphine he was being given as a painkiller , meaning he had to finish the surgery without any pain relief
he made it through the surgery , but two weeks later @entity1 was told he had chondrosarcoma -- a bone cancer that develops in cartilage
" doctors started talking about ' we need to go in and take out part of your spine , and you may never walk again ' -- things that were so drastic i could n't even comprehend , " @entity1 told @entity0
" i went into a state of anger -- i just did n't know what to make of all of it
to have everything taken from you from a control perspective , to be a the mercy of others and to have to learn something you do n't know anything about was really scary
" supported by his parents , both of whom are themselves cancer survivors , @entity1 recovered fully from the chondrosarcoma , but a few months later a mole on his chest was diagnosed as melanoma
incredibly , three months later , @entity1 was told he had a second melanoma
" when you 're 19 , to have it [ cancer ] once is abnormal , but to go through this period between my 19th and 20th birthdays -- it 's just not normal , " he said " you 're supposed to be in college , you 're supposed to be out having fun
i 'm supposed to be playing soccer and doing things i love and this was just interrupting my life
it was changing the course that i had imagined and what everybody had hoped for
" @entity1 is now completely cancer free but knows he is at risk of having melanoma again
his physical recovery has been so complete that he has managed to run numerous marathons , including a 100 - mile run in the @entity75 , but he is careful to schedule his training runs early in the morning to protect himself from the sun. realizing there was a lack of support for young adults with cancer , @entity1 and his family founded the @entity85 fund for @entity86 , which provides education , support and resources to young adults with cancer and their families
the foundation caught the notice of seven - times @entity96 champion and cancer survivor @entity97 and he enlisted @entity98 to help run the @entity3
@entity0 's chief medical correspondent @entity99 is also a board member of the foundation
@entity1 says he now spends much of his time raising money and talking with cancer survivors and their families
" it 's incredibly beneficial to help other people , " @entity1 told @entity0
" you help yourself and it also allows us to focus on other people 's experiences and try to help them as appose to dwelling on our own
" i 'm grateful for that , i 've learned so much from so many people who have such a spirit and resiliency -- it 's inspiring
