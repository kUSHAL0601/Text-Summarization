-- @entity1 , 15 , received a heart transplant tuesday night at @entity3 of @entity4 , according to a family spokesman
@entity1 is recovering and " doing great , " @entity6 said
@entity1 's case first attracted national attention when his family told media the hospital had denied him a spot on the heart transplant list
an august 7 letter from the hospital , which @entity6 provided to @entity0 , said that " @entity1 is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance , which is one of our center 's contraindications to listing for heart transplant
" noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow - up appointments
a week later , according to @entity6 , doctors reversed that decision and gave @entity1 top priority on the transplant list
on august 16 , @entity1 had a procedure to insert a device to support his failing heart , @entity6 said
the ventricular assist device , or @entity36 , was used to help the heart function and blood flow while he waited for the heart transplant
the mechanical pump included a small tube that carried blood out of the heart into a pump , and another tube that carried blood from the pump to blood vessels
vessels deliver blood to the body
@entity6 said @entity1 's heart transplant started at 6:15 p.m. on tuesday and lasted just over five hours
the teen has been in the hospital since july 14 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity55
children 's healthcare of @entity4 has been mum on @entity1 's case , citing patient privacy
last week a hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm @entity1 's @entity36 procedure and referred @entity0 to the family for related inquiries
the hospital is in good standing , according to the @entity66 , the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the @entity69
" @entity3 of @entity4 has performed 10 transplants so far this year ; three of them in the past week alone , " the hospital said in a statement wednesday
" since our transplant program 's inception , we have performed 279 pediatric heart transplants on children ages ranging from newborn to 21
" a matter of compliance assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient does n't strictly take all required medicines as directed , he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital , said dr. @entity88 , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 , who is not involved with this case
but @entity6 said a doctor told the family that @entity1 's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment
" the doctor made the decision that he was n't a good candidate because of that , " @entity6 said
" i guess he did n't think @entity1 was going to be a productive citizen
" @entity1 's mother , @entity105 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity106 that doctors said @entity1 would have lived only three to six months if he had n't gotten the heart transplant
the @entity111 's @entity110 chapter was involved in drawing media attention to @entity1 's case because the organization has " a longtime relationship with the child , " said the rev. @entity117 , the chapter 's president , @entity117 said @entity1 was judged based on " tattoos and an ankle bracelet " from a " juvenile agency
" @entity6 said the detention was because @entity1 got into " an altercation to protect his younger brother
" @entity1 had no health problems before this summer , @entity6 said ; the heart problem is not congenital
but he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting
his mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains
@entity6 said the family did n't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list
personally , @entity6 attributes it to " the handiwork of @entity139 and the media pressure
" the hospital did not comment on what led to doctors ' change of heart
the complexity of transplants federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012 , but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed
while waiting for a heart transplant , 331 people died
dr. @entity154 , medical director of @entity156 's @entity155 and @entity157 , said it 's not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance -- in other words , if they are seen as people who wo n't follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors
at @entity156 , @entity154 's group evaluates about 300 patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about 1 % to 2 % because of noncompliance
it 's about the same for heart transplants , as well , he said
as part of the evaluation process , organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen , @entity154 said
" a few times a year , we run into people who ca n't , " he said
a patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades , @entity154 said , but " we would want to look at the entire picture
" some patients have been denied because they do n't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments
after a heart transplant , patients are too sick to do these things alone , @entity154 said
" when we fear that someone 's not going to do well , it 's because the patient could n't comply with the regimen or they do n't have any support in their life , " he said
psychosocial factors do n't change a person 's priority on the waiting list , but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list , he said
@entity210 , head of the division of medical ethics at @entity213 , noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant -- showing up at medical appointments , taking medications , monitoring changes in health -- and teenagers in general do n't have a good track record of following orders
teenagers are n't automatically ruled out for heart transplants , but " the consequence that ' you are going to die if you do n't take these medicines ' is far from the mind of a 17 - year - old , " said @entity88 , the cardiothoracic surgeon
@entity210 said @entity1 should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what 's expected post-transplant .
