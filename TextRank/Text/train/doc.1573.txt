@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity1 president @entity5 has been placed under investigation for allegations stemming from his time as mayor of @entity0 , his office said friday
a judge in @entity11 , near @entity0 , questioned @entity5 friday morning over the employment of seven people who were hired by the city of @entity0 in the early 1990s
the suspicion is that the employees were working for @entity5 's right - wing political party , @entity18 , which no longer exists , while on the city payroll
@entity5 , 77 , was mayor of @entity0 between 1977 and 1995 , the year he became president
the case in @entity11 is similar to but separate from another investigation in @entity0 , in which @entity5 is accused of using 21 city employees to work on his presidential campaign
in a statement released by his office friday , @entity5 pointed out that he had " already answered all the questions related to this investigation regarding the seven jobs in july 2007 and that no new facts have surfaced since then
" @entity5 could face a five - year sentence and a fine of 75,000 euros ( $ 107,500 ) if found guilty of using the employees to work for his party
the former president denies the accusations
" on the investigation itself , president @entity5 repeats that no such ' system ' has ever existed in the @entity0 city hall , " the statement said
" he is determined to demonstrate this through the procedure which was started by being placed under investigation
" the former @entity1 head of state also said he " wishes the investigation to progress as quickly as possible to establish once and for all that he is beyond reproach
" former @entity1 prime minister @entity50 was already sentenced in december 2004 for his role in the affair , but @entity5 benefited from presidential immunity at the time
after @entity5 left office in may 2007 , he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter
current @entity0 mayor @entity59 had no comment about the investigation , according to officials with the city of @entity0 , which lodged the initial complaint against @entity5
the former president remains popular in @entity1
a survey released thursday , conducted by the opinion research company @entity67 for @entity69 magazine , showed that 78 percent of @entity1 people have a positive opinion of @entity5 -- making him the highest - rated politician since the survey began in november 2003
@entity2 's @entity74 contributed to this report .
