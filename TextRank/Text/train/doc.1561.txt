@entity3 rebels , who deposed @entity6 's government by force , have come to a preliminary agreement for a new government , showing willingness to negotiate , a @entity1 official said friday
it 's a breakthrough , said envoy @entity12
but it 's not a final deal
parties to the negotiations are hopeful it will prevent a civil war
it represents a shift of the @entity21 ' tone from just a month ago , when they stormed the capital @entity23 with guns blazing
after a years - long conflict with the government , the rebels attacked the residences of president @entity30 and prime minister @entity31 last month
when the two refused to concede the @entity21 ' political demands , the rebels , who are @entity34 in a majority @entity36 nation , forced them to resign
the offensive and takeover stunned governments in the @entity41 , who , along with other countries , pulled out diplomatic staff
@entity3 fighters took @entity47 vehicles and would not let departing @entity48 take their weapons with them
but @entity51 governments have other worries as well
@entity6 's former government was allied with the @entity54 and other @entity51 and @entity56 powers in the fight against @entity58 -- who are @entity60 extremists
there has been little sign so far of how willing to negotiate the @entity21 , who are supported by @entity64 and who have been secessionists , might be
the @entity1 envoy is helping broker the preliminary agreement between @entity3 leaders and the independent , relatively new justice and @entity70
the @entity21 applied pressure to get results , threatening to escalate violence , if no deal were reached , said @entity69 and @entity70 spokesman @entity75
" this deal is not perfect , but it ensures that @entity6 does not collapse , " he said
the agreement outlines only rough points
" there are still a number of issues on the dialogue table that must be agreed on dealing with the government and presidency as well guarantees for the implementation of the deal , " @entity12 said
@entity6 's legislative body , the @entity88 , will get a second chamber -- a brand new parliament
the @entity21 , who live in @entity6 's north , will get 50 % of the seats and concede 50 % to the country 's south
half of seats will go to the country 's women and youths , @entity12 said
the current @entity101 will remain as it is for now
the @entity1 had called for @entity3 fighters to withdraw from government institutions it had captured
whatever the military concessions , the agreement allows @entity3 gunmen to remain in @entity23 .
