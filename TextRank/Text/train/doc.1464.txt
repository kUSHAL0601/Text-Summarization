this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity16 , @entity17 : hi , i 'm @entity19 with your morning announcements
one : @entity0 is on , and you 're gon na love it
two : the @entity24 teachers ' lounge is open , and you 're gon na hear more about it in just a few minutes ! first up : economic plans @entity27 : first up , though , the economy , and a pair of plans that both aim to give it a needed boost
the first one comes from president @entity35
during a visit to @entity4 , @entity5 yesterday , he laid out his ideas to help the economy
they include cutting taxes for businesses that buy new equipment or do new research ; and spending money on the country 's infrastructure , things like roads and power programs
he also talked about some of the things that have happened since he took office in 2009
@entity52 president @entity35 : our economic plan has invested in badly needed infrastructure projects over the last nineteen months
not just roads and bridges , but high - speed railroads and expanded broadband access
altogether , these are projects that have led to thousands of good , private sector jobs , especially for those in the trades
mr. @entity65 and the @entity66 in @entity67 said no to these projects , fought them tooth and nail
@entity27 : you heard president @entity35 mention a mr. @entity65 there
that would be @entity66 house minority leader @entity65
he says the president 's economic plans so far have n't worked , and mr. @entity65 does n't think the new ideas will work either
he 's pushing a different plan to boost the economy , one that comes from @entity66 leaders in @entity67
this one has two main points
the first is to cut government spending
congressman @entity65 says that 's caused more debt and fewer jobs
the second point is to put a freeze on tax rates for two years
mr. @entity65 argues that when taxes go up , it hurts families and small businesses
@entity93 @entity27 : when it comes to something like the @entity99 oil spill , a lot of people want to know whom can be blamed
well , there 's a new report out that puts most of that blame on @entity103 and @entity104 , two companies that @entity93 hired to work on the oil well
but the report was written by @entity93
the company did accept some of the responsibility
it says faulty cementing , a misread pressure test , and a blowout preventer that was n't maintained correctly all led to the spill
@entity104 and @entity103 have criticized @entity93 's report
one expert talked about how this whole situation is a unique one
@entity119 , professor , @entity121 , @entity122 : what 's interesting in this case is that , you know , they actually went through eight steps and no one said , " hey , stop
" that , to me , is more of a rig problem than , say , a systemic problem across the oil industry
@entity134 @entity27 : 85 fires in four hours
that 's what firefighters in @entity6 , @entity7 had to deal with tuesday night
there were so many fires that nearby towns sent emergency workers to help out
fire officials say a lot of the blazes started when strong winds knocked down power lines
the winds then carried flames from house to house
that caused nine homes to catch fire on one block alone
officials say no one was hurt , but a power company spokesperson said 15,000 people still did n't have power yesterday morning
authorities think at least one fire might have been caused by arson ; it might have been set on purpose
is this legit ? @entity164 , @entity17 : is this legit ? fasting during the @entity166 holy month of @entity167 is one of the five pillars of @entity170
true ! during @entity167 , @entity166 do n't eat or drink during daylight hours
@entity172 @entity27 : there are more than a billion @entity166 around the world
and for them , @entity167 is the most sacred time of the year
it 's been going on since august ; it 'll finish at the end of this week
but the exact date when @entity167 finishes this year has some @entity166 considering how they might celebrate the end of @entity167
it 's on september 11th , and this is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that @entity167 has ended on that date
@entity181 visits an @entity170 center in @entity9 to see how celebrations might be balanced with sensitivity
( begin video ) @entity186 , @entity24 national correspondent : afternoon prayers at the @entity170 center of @entity8
as @entity167 draws to a close later this week , these worshipers are being advised to tone down what is usually a celebratory occasion
@entity193 , president , islamic center of @entity8 : after 30 days of fasting , you know , this is the month that ended our celebration
@entity202 : how will it be different this year ? shah : this year will be a little different
you know , we are not celebrating the way we suppose to do , normally would do
@entity202 : because ? shah : because of 9/11
@entity202 : the end of @entity167 , or @entity208 , depending on the moon thursday night , falls on either friday or saturday , which is september 11th
but many @entity166 have decided to mark it on friday
imam @entity213 @entity212 is the head of the @entity215 in @entity9 , an umbrella group of @entity166 organizations
@entity218 @entity217 , @entity219 : i guess people may think , look at @entity208 as a protest , you know , against , against people who may be celebrating
@entity202 : one @entity166 group , for example , celebrates @entity208 at @entity228 parks
this year , organizers have been careful not to schedule their events for september 11th
it comes against the backdrop over anger about the proposed @entity170 center near @entity235 and protests at other mosques around the country
@entity166 are trying to send out their own message , like this public service announcement created through grassroots efforts
@entity242 , @entity243 : i do n't want to take over this country
@entity202 : one @entity166 leader who works with an interfaith youth group in @entity248 says he feels the attitude towards @entity166 this year is unlike any other
@entity250 , @entity251 : frankly , i have not felt this fearful
a mother came up to me at my @entity166 house of worship earlier this week and said to me , " @entity256 , when will my 8 and 10 - year - old sons stop being bullied on the playground because of their names , @entity260 and @entity261 ? " and what i said to her is " very soon , very soon , " because the forces of inclusion in @entity52 have always defeated the forces of intolerance , and they will defeat the forces of intolerance again
@entity202 : this 9/11 , this mosque in @entity271 , @entity9 will dedicate a peace garden with other clergy , but it has also asked local police for protection following suspicious incident of broken windows at the mosque
@entity279 says his group has also decided not to hold a counter-protest saturday supporting the @entity170 center near @entity235 after the families of 9/11 victims requested they not hold the rally
@entity286 : we 've been encouraging our people to be calm , to be patient , but be firm and be strong and to reach out , you know
@entity202 : and this @entity170 center , for one , is opening its doors to hold open houses with the aim of promoting understanding
( @entity295 ) @entity296 @entity27 : @entity167 is n't the only religious holiday that 's happening this week
@entity296 , the @entity298 new year , began last night
it marks the start of the @entity301 , which end ten days later with @entity302
in @entity303 , @entity296 means " beginning of the year
" it 's also sometimes referred to as the " day of repentance " or " day of remembrance
" one of the holiday 's most significant rituals is the blowing of the shofar
it 's a ram 's horn that 's used to call people to worship during the @entity301
@entity314 @entity315 , @entity17 : time for the shoutout ! what is the name for small , rocky objects that are found in space ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity326 or @entity327 ) @entity328 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! l those rocky objects are called asteroids , and most of them are found between @entity333 and @entity334
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity338 @entity27 : the space community is buzzing about two asteroids that buzzed by @entity341 yesterday
one passed our planet in the morning
the other went by about 12 hours later
both of them were closer to the @entity341 than the moon is
officials say neither asteroid were any sort of threat to our planet
unless you had a telescope , you would n't even have been able to see them
what 's interesting about this is both asteroids passed so close to @entity341 on the same day , and that @entity361 spotted them so far in advance
the @entity24 teachers ' lounge @entity27 : we ask for your opinions on our blog , and you 're great about giving them to us
now , though , it 's your teachers ' turn ! the @entity373 is up and running
teachers , this is where you can sound off on education issues
this week 's question : when is the best time to start a new school year ? log on to the lounge at @entity381 , and tell us what you think
before we go @entity27 : all right , before we go , water skiing ai n't easy the first time you do it
even kneeboarding requires a bit of balance
this here dog has twice the legs we do , though , combined with a fish 's love for the water
and when it comes to tricks , sit , shake and roll over have nothing on this
chibi the water skiing dog is giving the water skiing squirrel a run for its acorns
how do you top this ? one neighbor says skydiving , maybe parasailing
goodbye @entity27 : we say hot dogging ! we 'll " ski " you tomorrow for our awesome friday edition of @entity0 ! i 'm sorry about the puns , but really i 'm not
talk to you soon !
