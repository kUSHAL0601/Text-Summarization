-- i can pinpoint the exact moment that put me on a path to moderate @entity5 's first anti-bullying panel last weekend
it happened 32 months ago , when i published a blog post about my first - grade daughter @entity8 , who was taunted for carrying a " @entity11 " water bottle and backpack
it was the post that launched a thousand geeks , and then 5,000 tweets
over the next weeks and months , i read a near - constant stream of e-mails , letters and messages from people around the world who wanted to share their own stories of bullying and peer victimization
the story touched the collective nerve of a very motivated and tech - savvy group of people , who took my daughter in as one of their own
my husband and i like to say that we were the first ones to adopt @entity8 , and the self - proclaimed geeks and nerds adopted her six years later
the kindness of strangers to our family served as the catalyst for my transition to full - time work as an anti-bullying advocate
after interviewing hundreds of people , including parents , teachers , kids , bullies , victims , bystanders , researchers , psychologists , lawmakers , celebrities and social workers , i wrote a book about why bullying persists in our culture and how we can end the cycle of fear
but even within geek culture , there is still a vast amount of peer victimization , harassment and bullying
the gaming industry has been plagued by a hotbed of vicious attacks -- male gamers versus female gamers and hardcore gamers versus casual gamers , with issues of misogyny and homophobia and discrimination coming to the forefront of our collective consciousness
within cosplay , people attack each other over myriad issues : is the costume authentic ? does the person have the right body shape or ethnicity for the chosen costume ? the roles of bullies and victims can sometimes be blurry , especially when someone who was bullied as a child grows up to be the aggressor
in a world that likes to simplify goodies versus baddies , bullying dynamics are not always so simple to deconstruct
comic - con is widely revered as the mecca of pop culture conventions , but it had never hosted a conversation directly about bullying
just as parents , kids and communities are talking about social cruelty in schools and online , i wanted to keep the discussion going among geeks and nerds
we need an opportunity to reach the content creators and ask : how can we respond to messages of bullying perpetuated by entertainment media while retaining dynamic narratives in music , movies , video games and comics ? two years ago at the first @entity121 , i met @entity122 , who played @entity123 during the final five seasons of " @entity125 : @entity126
" @entity122 has mentored kids in gangs for many years , and she views bullying prevention as a passion project
" there 's strength in the knowledge that countless bullied kids , who have felt so hopeless , have overcome that pain and have rich , fulfilling lives and relationships
and people who have been bullied have a unique ability to become compassionate voices , leaders and champions over oppression ; the potential for healing to conquer injustice is huge , " she explained
a bite - size tour of @entity5 at @entity5 , @entity122 and i debuted the newly formed @entity151 to lead conversations about a wide range of bullying issues
how can we get society to stop blaming the victim ? how can we create safer spaces for @entity160 kids ? how do we empower kids to speak up for others who are being victimized ? how do we raise children who are neither bullies nor victims ? the questions flew back and forth , bandied about by @entity151 members such as @entity167 , the @entity168 , @entity170 's @entity169 : speak up , the @entity171 and @entity172
at one point i stood back and looked around , equal parts grateful and amazed to be part of the discussion
surrounded by people in elaborate costumes , listening to the noise and excitement , i recalled the moment 32 months ago when i was just another worried mom , wondering how to help my kid
that moment led me here
comic - con is serving as a model for other conventions by addressing the issue of bullying
there is space for fun and games as well as tackling the more serious issues that affect convention - goers
comic conventions provide a common forum for those with passionate -- even obsessive -- interests , and the same people who were once taunted for dressing as @entity200 in school are now celebrated as cosplayers at a con
indeed , some of the strongest voices of support for @entity8 came from the @entity207 , an international charitable organization dedicated to creating exact costume replications of characters from @entity11
when @entity8 mentioned that she would like to be a @entity210 for @entity211 last year , the 501st @entity207 put out a call to action , and members worldwide donated parts for a miniature set of armor
the @entity217 assembled the costume and presented it to @entity8 in a ceremony that ended with her hugging @entity221
after @entity8 outgrows the armor , we 'll donate it back to the 501st so it can be passed to another child , most likely through the @entity226
@entity8 , who is off at sleep - away camp , was unable to attend @entity5
but she was with me every step of the way
late sunday afternoon , in the final hour of the final day of the con , the first - ever anti-bullying panel took place
from the moment i posed the first question to writer @entity237 of " @entity238 " and " @entity239 , " to the very last comments by @entity122 , the room was full
within hours of the panel ending , tweets were already coming in from people asking us to bring anti-bullying panels to other pop culture conventions
leaders in the geek community are spreading the word
i think back to the first moments of the panel , when i said to the room , " raise your hand if you still remember a specific incidence of being taunted from more than a decade ago
" the sheer number of hands in the air served as testimony to the power of hurt feelings to linger
from now on , @entity5 convention - goers will come for cosplay , entertainment , freebies , autographs -- and healing .
