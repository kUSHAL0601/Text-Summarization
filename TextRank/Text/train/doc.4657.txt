citizens have their fingers inked to show that they have voted
even though the day was marked by violence , the @entity35 still lauded the election as a security success
" @entity35 commends the @entity40 , who essentially conducted non-stop security operations following the april 5th elections , " said an @entity35 news release
" the @entity40 led all aspects of security , securing approximately 6,200 polling centers across the country
this is a historic accomplishment

" these elections are a significant step forward on @entity0 's democratic path , and the courage and resolve of the @entity0 people to make their voices heard is a testament to the importance of these elections to securing @entity0 's future , " read a statement from @entity57 press secretary @entity56
" as the president said when he reaffirmed our continuing commitment to @entity0 beyond 2014 , while the future of @entity0 must be decided by @entity0 , the @entity68 will support the @entity0 people as they continue the hard work of building a democracy
" this is the third election since the fall of the @entity51 in 2001 , and it 's set to be the first democratic transfer of power in the fragile , war - torn country
after casting his own ballot , president @entity81 gave a short speech urging other voters to head to polling stations , the presidential palace said
their participation would help lead to " stability and a prosperous life " in the country , he said
" in reality , today is the day that @entity0 is stepping from a transition period to stability , development and peace , " he said
" today is your day to come out and save your soil from being ruined , bring stability to your country , brighten its future , choose your president and found the future of children of this soil by your vote
" @entity81 opponent was top vote getter in first round @entity6 was a vocal critic of the @entity51 during their years in power
although he was once an ally of @entity81 , serving in his government as foreign minister , he has in recent years become an opponent
he challenged @entity81 in the 2009 election but dropped out after the first round to protest what he said was large - scale voting fraud
@entity7 is a former academic and @entity68 citizen who gave up his passport to run for the @entity0 presidency in 2009
he worked as an adviser to @entity81 and as finance minister in his cabinet
in the general election on april 5 , @entity6 secured 45 % of the vote , while @entity7 got 31.6 %
a candidate needs to receive more than 50 % of the votes to win the first round and avoid a runoff
vote counting has already started in some provinces , including northern @entity129 and southern @entity130 , @entity0 election officials said
some 7 million turned out to vote in the april 5 election , but there was no immediate information available about saturday 's turnout
the results will be announced on july 22 , the election commission said .
