-- @entity1 has joined @entity2 as back - up for @entity4 and @entity5 to complete the new team 's line - up for the 2010 @entity9 season
the 32 - year - old , who raced for @entity11 for the past four years and has a decade of experience in motorsport 's elite category , will take on a testing role and also be a reserve driver
" i am very pleased to be joining the @entity20 team , " the @entity17 told official web site www.mercedes-gp.com on thursday
" it 's the team which has attracted the most interest in the close season , not only because of the comeback of @entity4 , but also because this season sees the return of the @entity28 cars as a @entity29 works team for the first time in over 50 years
" while i would of course have preferred a seat as an active driver , i am really proud to be part of the new @entity28 team
i have seen how committed everyone at the team is and i feel the same
i will be doing my very best to support @entity4 and @entity5 this year
" @entity1 has a long association with @entity2 , which took over the world champion @entity30 at the end of last year
he was supported by the @entity17 manufacturer as a junior driver , and then was test driver for @entity2 for the 1998 and 1999 seasons before earning his first race drive with @entity47 in 2000
since then he has competed in 167 grands prix , achieving 12 podium finishes , but was left without a team when @entity11 pulled out of @entity9 last year
he joins a team led by @entity52 , who led the outfit to shock double world titles in 2009 as @entity55 won the drivers ' crown and @entity58 placed third overall to help clinch the manufacturers ' championship
@entity55 has since moved to @entity2 while veteran @entity62 @entity58 joined @entity63 , one of @entity1 's former teams .
