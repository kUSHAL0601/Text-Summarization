@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 , formerly @entity5 's top diplomat , who has been in @entity7 custody in @entity1 , has been transferred to the custody of the @entity1 government , an @entity1 official said wednesday
@entity4 was handed over on monday from @entity11 and is being held at @entity12 in @entity0 , @entity10 , deputy justice minister , told @entity2
this move comes as @entity11 , the last major @entity7 detention facility in @entity1 is being officially handed over to the @entity1 government on thursday
serving a 15 - year sentence , @entity4 was part of a transfer of more than two dozen former @entity5 regime members , 26 on monday and three last month
@entity4 , who has been hospitalized a number of times while in custody , has been in poor health , and his lawyers and family members have voiced their concerns about his handover to the @entity1 government and how we would be treated while in their custody
@entity10 said that the @entity30 detention facilities provide health care for inmates and @entity12 prison has a clinic
he said if needed the detainees could be taken to medical facilities elsewhere
@entity4 was one of the best - known faces of @entity5 's government , serving as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003 and as foreign minister for part of that time
in march 2009 , he was sentenced in connection with the 1992 executions of 42 merchants
he was captured by @entity7 forces in april 2003 , shortly after the @entity7 - led invasion that toppled the @entity5 regime
according to @entity10 , being former regime members will not affect the way @entity4 will be treated by @entity1 authorities .
