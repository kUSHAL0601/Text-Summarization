president @entity0 and his certain @entity2 opponent in november , @entity1 , shifted to full general election mode wednesday , portraying each other as threats to future @entity7 progress as their campaigns engaged in a " war over women " indicative of what to expect for the next seven months
a day after his path to the @entity2 nomination cleared by chief rival @entity15 's withdrawal , @entity1 sought to reverse a gender gap problem by attacking @entity0 's economic policies as bad for women
according to a @entity21 / @entity20 poll released tuesday , @entity1 trails well behind @entity0 among women voters -- a result also seen in recent @entity25 and @entity27 / @entity26 polls
@entity0 had the support of 57 % of women , compared with 38 % who said they backed @entity1 , while @entity1 had the backing of 52 % of men , compared with 44 % who backed @entity0 , the survey found
in a speech in @entity37 at a woman - owned small business , @entity1 referred wednesday to a @entity41 attack line that @entity2 were waging a " war on women " through socially conservative policies involving abortion , health care and other issues by saying : " the real war on women is being waged by the president 's failed economic policies
" " now the president says , ' oh i did n't cause this recession
' that 's true , " @entity1 said
" he just made it worse , and made it last longer
and because it lasted longer , more and more women lost jobs , such that in his three - and - a - half years , 92.3 % of the people who lost jobs have been women
his failures have hurt women
" however , the nonpartisan website @entity66 rated the 92.3 % job loss statement " mostly false , " saying it included figures from the beginning of the @entity0 administration , before his policies could take effect
in addition , @entity66 said the figure failed to reflect a historical pattern of recessions first causing unemployment in traditionally male - dominated industries such as construction , and then later affecting fields with larger percentages of female workers
the @entity1 campaign later provided a copy of a letter it sent to @entity66 that challenged the " mostly false " rating
an analysis of federal labor statistics shows that the @entity1 claim is technically true but lacks important context
the number of nonfarm - employed women from january 2009 , when @entity0 took office , to march 2012 fell far more than the number of employed men in that period
the total job loss for the period for both men and women combined was 740,000
the number of women who lost nonfarm jobs in that time span was 683,000 , according to figures from the @entity108
that amounts to 92.3 % -- the figure @entity1 cited
however , the statistic does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job loss pie in the year leading up to @entity0 's inauguration
in the 2008 calendar year , men lost a total of 2.7 million nonfarm jobs , compared with 895,000 jobs lost for women
men made up 75.4 % of the 3.6 million jobs lost that year
@entity1 's claim also does not reflect that the job losses for women began in march 2008 , almost a full year before @entity0 took office
at that point , women held a total of 67.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs , the highest level of female employment of the @entity135 administration
from that high point , the number of women with nonfarm payroll jobs fell for 23 consecutive months , spanning from the final 10 months of the @entity135 administration and first 13 months of the @entity0 administration
since february 2010 , women have actually gained 863,000 jobs
meanwhile , a @entity1 adviser initially hesitated when asked if @entity1 supported the @entity144 that expands workers ' rights to sue in the event of a pay discrepancy between a man and a woman
" we 'll get back to you on that , " romney campaign policy director @entity151 told reporters
a @entity1 campaign statement afterward said the candidate supported pay equity for women , but it did not specifically say he backed the 2009 @entity161 law
the @entity0 campaign immediately fired back , issuing a statement from @entity161 that criticized @entity1 for failing to " stand up for women and their families
" " anyone who wants to be president of the @entity7 should n't have to think about whether they support pursuing every possible avenue to ensuring women get the same pay for the same work as men , " @entity161 said in the statement
a @entity1 campaign official later said that the candidate had no plans to change the current pay equity laws if elected
@entity178 , the senior adviser to @entity0 's campaign , called it a " tough day " for @entity1 's efforts to repair damage with women voters stemming from the @entity2 primary campaign
@entity178 dubbed the those efforts the " @entity188 with @entity189 " in a @entity187 post
@entity0 , meanwhile , continued his push for @entity191 to pass a tax measure that would ensure that millionaires -- like @entity1 -- pay a higher tax rate than middle - class workers
" it 's just plain wrong that middle - class @entity201 pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some millionaires and billionaires , " @entity0 told a @entity197 event , flanked by millionaires who support the proposed measure
@entity2 want to cut taxes for the wealthy , which would mean cutting spending on programs that spur economic growth and benefit the middle class , senior citizens and the poor , @entity0 argued
" they want to double down on some of the inequities that already exist in the tax code , " he said , adding that such a step means " either you 've got to borrow more money to pay down a deeper deficit , or you 've got to demand deeper sacrifices from the middle class and you 've got to cut investments that help us grow as an economy
" citing " significant " deficits and the need to be competitive in the 21st century 's " technologically integrated economy , " @entity0 said : " we ca n't afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for wealthy @entity201 who do n't need them and were n't even asking for them
" in a swipe at @entity2 economic policy , @entity0 added : " in @entity7 , prosperity has never just trickled down from the wealthy few
" also wednesday , the @entity0 campaign released a video highlighting @entity1 's conservative stances on issues such as abortion rights , health care reform and immigration reform
the video concludes with @entity1 's declaration on the campaign trail that he was " a severely conservative @entity2 governor
" the competing messages were attempts by both sides to frame what is expected to be a close and vicious general election campaign in a favorable perspective
@entity0 portrays @entity1 and @entity2 as protectors of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class , while @entity1 and his party say @entity0 has stifled economic recovery and failed to effectively tackle deficit reduction
@entity1 still needs to win several hundred delegates to clinch the @entity2 nomination , but @entity15 was his top remaining challenger , and tuesday 's announcement that @entity15 suspended his campaign leaves @entity1 's path free of obstacles
however , @entity1 's campaign still struggles to generate enthusiasm among the @entity2 conservative base , which questions his more moderate stances as @entity267 governor
sources said @entity1 wants @entity15 -- who had strong support among social conservatives , including @entity273 evangelicals -- to quickly endorse his campaign
while @entity1 and @entity15 aides said the former @entity7 senator from @entity277 will work to defeat @entity0 , it was unclear when or if @entity15 would offer a full - throated endorsement for @entity1
in his announcement tuesday that he was suspending his campaign , @entity15 never mentioned @entity1
" i expect when i finally become the nominee , and i hope that happens soon , that we 'll be campaigning together , we 'll be working together , " @entity1 said wednesday
" we share very much the same beliefs about the course the nation must take and the fact that under this president , @entity7 is not going in the right direction
" @entity15 has consistently said @entity2 needed a true conservative candidate -- himself -- to defeat @entity0 , and he has relentlessly attacked @entity1 's support for health care reforms in @entity267 that included a mandate for coverage similar to the 2010 federal health care law despised by conservatives
@entity1 said he would try to attract @entity15 's evangelical and socially conservative supporters by leveraging appearances with the former candidate
" we campaign together and make sure we see these people and get a chance to talk to them about issues that all @entity201 care about , " @entity1 said
" i think you see our party , and you will see our party more united than it 's been in a long , long time , in part because president @entity0 has taken @entity7 in such a different course than we have ever gone as a nation before
" former house speaker @entity311 and @entity313 rep. @entity312 , the other @entity2 challengers who trail far back , said they intended to stay in the race to the @entity2 convention in august
the @entity0 campaign immediately took aim at @entity1 after @entity15 's announcement , with campaign manager @entity320 saying it was " no surprise that @entity1 finally was able to grind down his opponents under an avalanche of negative ads. " " the more the @entity7 people see of @entity1 , the less they like him and the less they trust him , " @entity320 said in a statement
" while calling himself the ' ideal candidate ' for the tea party , he has promised to return to the same policies that created the economic crisis and has alienated women , middle - class families and @entity201
" @entity27 's latest estimate of the @entity2 delegate tally shows @entity1 with 659 , @entity15 with 275 , @entity338 with 140 and @entity312 with 71
it takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination
@entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity37 vote on april 24 , in addition to @entity277
in all , 231 delegates are up for grabs in the five states
the goal now for @entity338 and @entity312 is to prevent @entity1 from reaching the 1,144 - delegate threshold before the convention
on wednesday , though , @entity338 spent time explaining how a technical glitch caused his campaign to bounce a $ 500 check for @entity357 primary election fees .
