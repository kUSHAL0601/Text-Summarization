-- the @entity2 countryside -- still green , still rolling , still packed with charming eccentrics -- is more appealing than ever these days , as overwhelmed urbanites are flooding the area in search of a rural idyll
it 's been more than 100 years since @entity11 wrote , " anybody can be good in the country
there are no temptations there
" these days , all irony aside , quite the opposite is true
the shires are far from unsophisticated , even if one still must trade @entity18 for @entity19 when taking those long country walks
the best new additions to the area -- like the ones assembled here -- respect their past , no matter how thoroughly modern they might be
from the dells of @entity28 to the wooded countryside of @entity30 , from charming @entity32 villages to the @entity34 ' wild northern moors , the evidence is manifold
crumbling estates have been restored into plush , contemporary hotels
and more are still to come : the @entity38 - designed @entity37 debuts near @entity39 in may , and a year from now , @entity42 hand @entity40 will open @entity43 in @entity30
such is the mood afoot in @entity45 , with old - fashioned pubs serving inventive cuisine and upscale stores and spas catering to a cosmopolitan crowd
today , @entity11 be damned , the @entity2 countryside is very tempting indeed

before becoming a hotel in 2003 , the house was the longtime residence of garden designer @entity68 , who filled the 11 - acre grounds with purple alliums and weeping cherry trees ; now the hotel 's bold interiors have been redone to better reflect @entity68 's aesthetic
garden - inspired furniture and soft creams and whites play off honeyed stone , and the spa pays further homage to @entity68 with treatments that highlight the rejuvenating power of plants
the nearby @entity85 , from the same owners , consistently delivers a cozy atmosphere and very good seasonal food , such as @entity89 crab , ham hock salad or a bowl of clams and mussels with @entity32 cider , parsley and cream

the real delight , though , is @entity168 , a tiny day spa and yoga studio with an ecoconscious sensibility : wool from @entity152 's sheep insulates the spa 's sustainable wood walls , and therapies feature organic , chemical - free products , many from the @entity180 line
