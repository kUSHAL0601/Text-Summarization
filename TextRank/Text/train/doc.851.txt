@entity0 rep. @entity0 has defeated @entity2 sen. @entity1 in @entity3 , according to a @entity5 projection
the win is one of six seats @entity9 need to pick up to regain control of the @entity11
like other democrats in contentious @entity11 races this cycle , @entity1 has struggled to distance himself from president @entity15 , who is hugely unpopular in the state -- only 34 % of voters in @entity3 approved of @entity15 , according to a @entity5 / @entity19 poll
even @entity3 ' favorite son could n't give @entity1 enough of a boost
president @entity23 had swung through the state more than a half - dozen times this cycle , again stumping with @entity1 in the state this weekend
but @entity1 's struggles seemed to go beyond what any surrogate could fix , with the two - term @entity3 senator stumbling on a softball question on the president 's handling of the @entity36 disease
" um ... i would say that ... it 's hard to know , uh , because i have n't heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details -- i mean , i read the paper and all but , " @entity1 said in an interview last month
and that came just over a month after his campaign ran an ad attacking his opponent for voting " against preparing @entity49 for pandemics like @entity36 , " which was widely panned as misleading
@entity0 faced his most stinging criticism over his opposition to reauthorizing the @entity53
@entity1 slammed @entity0 for voting against the bill in a brutal campaign and that claimed @entity0 does n't want " to protect women and children
" @entity0 defended his vote against the bill , calling the law " too broad " in scope
but while 138 @entity9 also joined @entity0 in voting against the final version of the bill , @entity0 also voted against an earlier @entity66 proposal -- the only @entity3 @entity66 to do so .
