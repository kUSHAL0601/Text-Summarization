-- @entity1 , @entity2 and i kick off this week 's episode of " the @entity6 " podcast by tackling @entity9 ' @entity8 hearings from three distinct perspectives
ever the centrist , my beloved husband @entity12 questions whether the hearings are an earnest search for the truth or a hyperpartisan @entity17 political witch hunt aimed at embarrassing the @entity19 administration while derailing @entity21 's potential 2016 presidential bid
@entity1 and i duke it out from opposite perspectives , and we all agree on a surprising point at the end
then , on to a discussion of the dramatic fractures within the @entity17 on immigration reform -- a split between former sen. @entity32 's @entity31 and his @entity34 © @entity33 © sen. @entity33 -- which give @entity1 cause for celebration
but i 'm not sure he will ultimately like the outcome of these @entity17 growing pains , which i suspect reveal a realignment of @entity17 reformers from old guard thinking
cracks in what had been @entity17 monolithic thinking on issues ranging from immigration to gun control to gay rights -- in a week where @entity50 became the 11th state to pass marriage equality with a genuine bipartisan majority -- could reinvigorate the @entity17 brand and lead to a more competitive party nationally
@entity12 thinks renewal and competition in any party orthodoxy is healthy for @entity61 , but @entity1 is clearly rooting for @entity32 's success , even if it means the end of the @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity64
to be fair , @entity1 's a comedian , so maybe his partisanship is good for laughs , but it will give way to a desire for good policy to win the day -- even if the @entity17 get some credit
we 'll let you decide
finally , was gov. @entity76 's lap band surgery motivated by political ambition or personal health ? one of us thinks @entity61 are too obsessed with weight to elect an obese president
another worries that the act of losing weight will obscure @entity76 's record in @entity85 if he decides to challenge @entity21 in 2016
is it possible for aspiring elected officials to make decisions independent of their political future ? we hope you have as much fun hearing us analyze these issues as we had laughing it out over them
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity98 .
