-- are @entity2 forces using chemical weapons in their years - long fight to hold on to power ? that 's what the head of the @entity10 intelligence research and analysis division said tuesday , becoming the latest to allege that @entity12 was employing weapons banned under international law against its own people
the claim further stoked the debate about the international community 's role in @entity2 , where the @entity20 estimated this month that 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict flared in march 2011
@entity24 president @entity23 , for one , has said the @entity2 government 's use of chemical weapons against its own people would be a " game changer " in how his and other nations address the crisis
on tuesday , his nation 's top diplomat said tuesday that the @entity24 does not know definitively that such chemical weapons had been deployed
in fact , @entity24 secretary of state @entity36 said , @entity35 prime minister @entity34 also did not confirm the use of such weapons when the two spoke by phone earlier in the day
" the information that i have at this point does not confirm it to me ( in a manner ) that i would feel comfortable commenting on it as a fact , " @entity36 said
gen. @entity50 , though not offering any direct evidence , stated firmly on tuesday the belief that @entity2 forces have increasingly used " ground - to - ground missiles , rockets and chemical weapons
" he specified that sarin gas -- an odorless nerve agent that can quickly kill thousands by causing convulsions , paralysis and respiratory failure -- was most likely used , as were " neutralizing and nonlethal chemical weapons
" @entity50 pointed to one episode on march 19 in which , he said , " victims suffered from shrunken pupils , foaming from the mouth and other symptoms which indicate the use of deadly chemical weapons
" " according to our professional assessment , the regime has used deadly chemical weapons against armed rebels on a number of occasions in the past few months , " said @entity50 , according to quotes provided by the @entity10
in a letter to the @entity20 secretary - general in december , @entity2 said the @entity24 had falsely accused it of using chemical weapons
chemical weapons frightful , relatively inexpensive before the @entity35 official 's announcement tuesday , a @entity20 - led investigation was already looking into accusations of chemical weapons use by the @entity2 government
@entity87 foreign minister @entity86 warned tuesday against jumping to conclusions by repeating the " @entity90 scenario " in which claims that @entity92 's government possessed so - called weapons of mass destruction were the basis of the @entity24 - led invasion
@entity86 accused other nations of " politicizing the issue
" further , he criticized how international investigators looking into an alleged use of chemical investigators in @entity102 had demanded access to to all facilities in @entity2 and to have the right to interview any @entity2
" i believe that is too much , " @entity86 said
@entity24 : chemical weapon use ' difficult to confirm ' while he did n't detail a possible @entity24 response , @entity109 spokesman @entity108 on tuesday called the potential use of chemical weapons inside @entity2 " unacceptable
" at the same time , he said , " the use of chemical weapons is difficult to confirm
" in addition to @entity2 's possible use of chemical weapons against rebels , another concern is that parts of the government 's stockpile of chemical weapons -- which analysts believe is one of the world 's largest and includes sarin , mustard and @entity129 gases -- could end up , if they have n't already , in others ' hands
a senior @entity24 official told @entity0 on tuesday that @entity2 government forces have carried out several movements of chemical weapons during the past month
months of warnings , speculation swirl around @entity2 's chemical weapons @entity24 officials said they believe the chemical stockpiles remain under government control , but the movements have complicated the @entity24 effort to keep track of them
asked last week at a hearing whether the @entity24 could guarantee that it could secure @entity2 's chemical weapons stockpile if the government were to fall , the chairman of the @entity148 was noncommittal
" not as i sit here today , simply because they have been moving it , and the number of sites is quite numerous , " said gen. @entity152
@entity158 spokesman @entity157 said tuesday that the @entity24 stresses to @entity2 , " in the strongest possible terms , ( its ) obligations ... to safeguard its chemical weapons stockpiles and not to use or transfer such weapons to terrorist groups like @entity164
" @entity35 minister : it 's clear that chemical weapons were used in @entity2 addressing the press monday , a day before @entity50 's briefing , @entity35 's defense minister did not seem to indicate that his government has absolute proof of chemical weapons use in @entity2
but if there was , @entity35 is prepared to act
" we are ready to operate if any rogue element is going to put his hands or any chemical agents are going to be delivered toward rogue elements in the region , " defense minister @entity175 said
analyst : ' a fantastic weapon of fear ' @entity2 is n't one of the 188 nations that have signed on to the @entity188 that prohibits the production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons
fellow @entity194 nations having taken a similar stance , officially refusing to sign on until @entity35 signs the @entity196
yet @entity2 has denied having such weapons , as well as using them during its ongoing civil war
( @entity12 has accused rebels of using such weapons , though , including in an attack last month in the northern province of @entity102 that state media claimed killed 25 people
) it 's also expressed concerns that its government might be falsely implicated if " terrorists " -- a term it uses to refer to rebel fighters -- employ such weapons
report : @entity2 officials claim chlorine , saline mix used in @entity102 attack " what raises concerns ... is our serious fear that some of the countries backing terrorism and terrorists might provide the armed terrorist groups with chemical weapons and claim that it was the @entity2 government that used the weapons , " the state - run news agency @entity217 reported
unlike nuclear weapons , chemical weapons are inexpensive to develop and stockpile
this lends them a disproportionate importance for @entity2 and the region , analysts say
" in the @entity194 , chemical weapons have been seen as a possible counter to @entity35 's nuclear weapons , " @entity235 of the @entity236 at @entity237 said in march
@entity241 , a research associate at the @entity242 , said last month that @entity2 embraced a chemical weapons program as a way to bolster its strategic strength despite economic weaknesses , especially after @entity35 imposed a series of humiliating military defeats on the @entity250 world
@entity2 's chemical weapon potential " the best way to operate asymmetrically was for @entity2 to have its chemical weapons program , " she said
according to @entity241 , chemical weapons ' utility is " quite limited , " as they are more of a deterrent than a real battlefield or tactical weapon
" if you shoot a missile at a population center , you can be fairly certain that anyone it hits will die , " she said
" chemical weapons use is not as clear - cut as that
it depends on topography , weather , how you deliver the chemical weapons , and you ca n't always be clear it will cause maximum casualty
" their real power is in psychological , she said
" it 's a fantastic weapon of fear
" @entity0 's @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 contributed to this report .
