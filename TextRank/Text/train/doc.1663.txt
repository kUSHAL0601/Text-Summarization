even after the identification of the @entity3 bombing suspects through grainy security - camera images , officials say that blanketing a city in surveillance cameras can create as many problems as it solves
a network of cameras on city streets and other public spaces increases the chances of capturing a criminal on video but can generate an overwhelming amount of evidence to sift through
the cameras make some people feel more secure , knowing that bad guys are being watched
but privacy advocates and other citizens are uneasy with the idea that @entity24 is monitoring their every public move
meanwhile , facial - recognition software and other technologies are making security - camera images more valuable to law enforcement
now , software can automatically mine surveillance footage for information , such as a specific person 's face , and create a giant searchable database
after last week 's bombings at the @entity39 , authorities had to sift through a mountain of footage from government surveillance cameras , private security cameras and imagery shot by bystanders on smartphones
it took the @entity48 only three days to release blurry shots of the two suspects , taken by a department store 's cameras
compare their quick turnaround with the 2005 @entity56 bombings , when it took thousands of investigators weeks to parse the city 's @entity59 ( closed - circuit television ) footage after the attacks
the cameras , software and algorithms have come a long way in eight years
cities under surveillance in major cities , in the age of terrorism , someone is almost always watching
the cameras used in @entity56 are part of the city 's extensive and sophisticated " @entity76 " surveillance system that combines nearly a half million cameras , roadblocks and license plate readers to monitor the heart of the city
set up in 1998 , the system is one of the most advanced in the world and allows authorities to track anyone going into or out of central @entity56
many residents question the effectiveness of @entity56 's system , however
in 2008 , only one crime was solved for every 1,000 cameras , according to the city 's police
@entity59 cameras across @entity97 also cost authorities nearly $ 800 million over the past four years , according to civil liberties group @entity99
modeled after @entity56 's system , @entity101 's @entity100 monitors 4,000 security cameras and license plate readers south of @entity104
the project uses feeds from both private and public security cameras , which are are all monitored 24 hours a day by the @entity108
using face and object - detection technology , the police can track cars and people moving through 1.7 square miles in lower @entity114 and even detect unattended packages
the $ 150 million initiative also includes a number of radiation detectors and automatic roadblocks that can can be used to stop traffic in an emergency
@entity3 's camera network is smaller than those in @entity56 and @entity101 , though that is likely to change soon
in 2007 , @entity3 law enforcement had an estimated 55 cctv cameras set up around the city
since then , the city has expanded its surveillance system , though authorities there are not commenting on the exact scope of the current camera setup
@entity3 's example has shown the power of these systems to help solve crimes , causing many to call for even more cameras
but it 's still not clear whether they are effective at preventing crimes
according to the @entity142 at @entity143 in @entity144 , urban surveillance systems have not been proven to have any effect on deterring criminals
facial recognition as the volume and quality of cameras and sensors are ramped up , cities are turning to more advanced face - and object - recognition software to makes sense of the data
" we describe what 's in the video , and we store that in a database , " said @entity156 , ceo of @entity158 - based @entity157 , one of several companies that makes this type of facial - recognition technology
the company 's first investor was @entity168 , the @entity169 's venture - capital arm , which finds and funds promising security - related technology
now , @entity157 works with federal and local law enforcement agencies , as well as private companies and banks
its software can identify objects by shape , size and color
it can read license plates and recognize cars
when it comes to people , it can detect their gender , approximate age , mood and other demographic information
using multiple cameras , it can track their patterns and some behaviors
it automatically zooms in on any person 's face and identifies them based on things like the distance between their eyes or the shape of their nose
all that information is stored in a database
big clues that would take a traditional investigator untold hours of watching video to uncover can be found with a 15 - second search query
opinion : surveillance state no answer to terror for example , they could do a search for anyone who entered a @entity217 between 8 and 11 p.m. on a specific night , pull up the times that certain cars have entered and left a parking lot , or ask for images of every person who has entered a certain building over the past year
" it instantaneously gives you a picture of everybody who has walked in the door in the past based on the geometries of their face , " @entity156 said
privacy concerns civil - liberties activists are concerned about how this technology could be abused
with cameras in far - flung cities all connecting to the same database , a person 's movements can be tracked across states or continents
for example , it could be used to single out a person attending multiple political protests
" we like to think we have some privacy in our lives , that we can go places that we do n't necessarily want the government to know about , " said said @entity253 , an attorney at the @entity254 , an @entity255 civil - liberties group
" what concerns me is if all of those cameras get linked together at some point , and if we apply facial recognition on the back end , we 'll be able to track people wherever they go
" for now , many of the biometrics databases in the @entity266 are still separated
some are scattered across various federal and local government agencies , and connecting them will take time and big budgets
the @entity48 is in the process of building out its own facial - recognition database and is working with state dmvs to access their photos
it 's less likely the government will be able to tap into private databases anytime soon , but it 's still a cause for concern down the line , privacy advocates say
@entity282 has the largest facial - recognition database in the world , a potentially rich vein of data for any government agency
another worry is the misidentification of suspects
@entity156 acknowledges that these systems can make mistakes but says the computers are n't there to take over for humans but to assist investigators by weeding out useless information
" the cameras themselves are not a panacea
they 're not going to solve the problem
it 's one of the steps , " he said
but at least one prominent tech blogger thinks the benefits of surveillance cameras outweigh our fears about privacy
" the idea of submitting to constant monitoring feels wrong , nearly un-american , to most of us
cameras in the sky are the ultimate manifestation of @entity24 -- way for the government to watch you all the time , everywhere , " @entity314 wrote last week in @entity315
but @entity314 thinks we need to be thinking about ways to make cameras work for us , not reasons to abolish them
" when you weigh cameras against other security measures , they emerge as the least costly and most effective choice
in the aftermath of 9/11 , we 've turned most public spaces into fortresses -- now , it 's impossible for you to get into tall buildings , airports , many museums , concerts , and even public celebrations without being subjected to pat - downs and metal detectors
when combined with competent law enforcement , surveillance cameras are more effective , less intrusive , less psychologically draining , and much more pleasant than these alternatives
