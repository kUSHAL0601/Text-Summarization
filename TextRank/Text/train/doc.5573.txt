the same superbug that contributed to two deaths in @entity3 has been reported in @entity5 , where one person has died , a spokesman told @entity4
eighteen people have contracted carbapenem - resistant @entity8 , or @entity9 , so far this year , said @entity10 , spokesman with the @entity11
of those , 15 had @entity9 upon admission to the hospital in @entity15 ; three acquired it in the hospital , and one died , the spokesman said
the cause of death was not immediately clear
@entity10 declined to provide details on any of the patients
it was also not clear how any of them became infected
in @entity3 , seven patients contracted @entity9 after routine endoscopic procedures
two of them died , the @entity28 said last week
@entity9 was a contributing factor in the deaths , but the exact cause of the deaths was n't immediately disclosed in those cases either
hospital officials there have said the outbreak was caused by two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even though disinfection guidelines were followed
the @entity41 hospital was using a duodenoscope made by @entity43 , but the @entity44 is also reviewing data from the two other @entity47 companies that make the devices , @entity49 and @entity50
the medical center is contacting 179 others who underwent endoscopic procedures between october and january
it 's offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria
in a statement , @entity10 said @entity11 uses standard methods for disinfecting its equipment , saying that all duodenoscopes that have been tested have shown to be negative for @entity9
some @entity9 bacteria can resist most antibiotics , the @entity61 says on its website
@entity4 's @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 contributed to this report .
