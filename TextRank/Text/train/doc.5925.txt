-- a chemist accused of failing to follow protocols at a @entity5 crime lab had been involved in testing some 50,000 drug samples , potentially opening the door to a swath of legal challenges , officials said wednesday the list of samples was turned over to prosecutors and public defenders on tuesday
the samples were tested during @entity17 's nine - year term at the facility , state authorities said
the samples were from an estimated 34,000 cases @entity17 worked on during her career , authorities said
" fifty - thousand drug samples in question could mean numerous wrongful convictions , vacated sentences , dismissed cases , overturned convictions and so on , " said @entity23 , forensic services director committee for @entity25
" whether or not all those samples were affected , we do n't know
" @entity23 said investigators first learned of a breach in protocol in february over a june 2011 incident in which samples were incorrectly catalogued
" this is going to be a huge amount of work for both defense and prosecution attorneys and a huge drain in resources in attempting to figure out the extent of the situation , " @entity23 said
the @entity50 lab certified drug samples for @entity5 law enforcement before gov. @entity52 ordered it closed august 30 in the wake of an investigation into the scandal
" this is deeply troubling information , " @entity52 said in statement last week
" no breach this serious can or will be tolerated
the @entity62 will continue their investigation to determine what happened and who is responsible so that we can hold those accountable
" the state 's @entity67 said it had " placed an additional lab supervisor on leave pending the outcome of our investigation
" " our job now is to continue to work with the attorney general 's office to get to the bottom of what went wrong , assign accountability where it is warranted and prevent this type of breach from happening again
" @entity17 could not be immediately reached comment .
