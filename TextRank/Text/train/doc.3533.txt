-- retired gen. @entity3 , who led allied forces to a routing of @entity6 in the 1991 @entity7 and became one of the nation 's most celebrated military heroes of the era , died thursday , a @entity2 defense official said
the death of the retired four - star army general was confirmed by defense secretary @entity14 , who described @entity3 as " one of the great military giants of the 20th century
" president @entity17 called the death of @entity3 a loss of an " @entity2 original
" " from his decorated service in @entity22 to the historic liberation of @entity24 and his leadership of @entity26 , @entity3 stood tall for the country and @entity28 he loved , " @entity17 said
" our prayers are with the @entity3 family , who tonight can know that his legacy will endure in a nation that is more secure because of his patriotic service
" virtually unknown to the public before the @entity7 , @entity3 became a household name while he oversaw the buildup of 700,000 coalition troops , including more than 540,000 @entity2 forces , after @entity6 invaded @entity24 in 1990
the war began on january 17 , 1991 , with the start of the nearly six - week air campaign against @entity6 that was followed by a 100 - hour ground offensive that pushed @entity6 leader @entity46 's forces out of @entity24
a @entity48 correspondent described the general , as he prepared his troops along the @entity24 border , as a man " with a @entity54 swagger and a growl like a grizzly
" @entity3 , dubbed " @entity3 " by his troops because of his reported temper , captured the public 's imagination with his plain , frank talk about the war 's progress
he once told a room full of reporters : " as far as @entity46 being a great military strategist , he is neither a strategist , nor is he schooled in the operational arts , nor is he a tactician , nor is he a general , nor is he a soldier
other than that , he 's a great military man , i want you to know that
" former secretary of state @entity71 , who served as chairman of the @entity73 and , therefore , @entity3 's commander , said the general 's leadership during the war inspired the nation
" ' @entity3 ' led the coalition forces to victory , ejecting the @entity28 from @entity24 and restoring the rightful government , " @entity71 said in a statement
" his leadership not only inspired his troops , but also inspired the nation
he was a good friend of mine , a close buddy
" @entity3 , a highly decorated @entity85 veteran , ushered in a new era for the @entity2 military , whose exploits were broadcast live around the clock
after the war , he was featured in his desert fatigues on the cover of nearly every major @entity2 magazine , and he joined thousands of troops for a welcome - home ticker tape parade in @entity96
@entity98 's @entity97 made him an honorary knight , and he received a standing ovation from @entity101 upon his return to the @entity2
former president @entity103 , who is hospitalized , said the general " epitomized the ' duty , service , country ' creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great nation through our most trying international crises
" " more than that , he was a good and decent man -- and a dear friend , " @entity103 said in a statement released by his office
while @entity3 's leadership was heralded , critics raised questions about the decision to quickly end the ground war in @entity6 and leave @entity46 in power
@entity3 was heavily criticized in the @entity124 book " the @entity125 : @entity126 from @entity127 to today " for allowing @entity6 to use helicopters in no - fly zones established after the war
@entity6 used the helicopters to put down a @entity133 uprising that had been openly encouraged by the @entity2
@entity3 told @entity0 's @entity134 in a september 1992 interview that the preferred plan with @entity6 was to avoid ever having to invade
" we never wanted a war , " he said
" once the war started , we were hoping that ... they 'd come to their senses and stop right then
... after 38 days , we got to a point where we could launch the ground war and , by that time , they had n't withdrawn
" while his role in the @entity7 made him famous , @entity3 told @entity134 , war itself and the bloodshed that went with it did n't appeal to him
absolutely , i hate war , " he said
" good generalship is a realization that ... you 've got to try and figure out how to accomplish your mission with a minimum loss of human life
" in his autobiography , " it does n't take a hero , " @entity3 outlined the reasons that coalition forces did n't press on to the @entity6 capital during the first @entity7
" had the @entity2 and the @entity160 gone on alone to capture @entity161 , under the provisions of the @entity164 and @entity165 conventions we would have been considered occupying powers and therefore would have been responsible for all the costs of maintaining or restoring government , education and other services for the people of @entity6
" @entity3 wrote that had " we taken all of @entity6 , we would have been like a dinosaur in the tar pit -- we would still be there , and we , not the @entity177 , would be bearing the costs of that occupation
" @entity3 supported the 2003 @entity2 - led invasion of @entity6 , though he later criticized the @entity181 for what he called mistakes that included sending undertrained @entity185 and @entity186 troops into combat
@entity3 retired in august 1991 , hit the lecture circuit and briefly was a military analyst for @entity190
he told @entity134 that he was asked to run for @entity191
" i got off the airplane and they came after me to , you know , run for senator in @entity196 , and i told them , ' no , ' " he said
" i 'm not a politician
i 'd make a lousy politician
" born in @entity200 , @entity201 , in 1934 , he was named @entity3 after his father
his father , major gen. @entity3 , a @entity204 graduate who fought in @entity205 , became head of @entity207 , helping to build the fledgling force and eventually leading the investigation of the infamous lindbergh baby kidnapping
" the day i was born , my father said ... ' that boy is going to @entity204 , ' " @entity3 recalled to @entity134
" and that 's the only thing i ever heard my entire young life
" after @entity127 , according to the book , the younger @entity3 traveled to @entity216 to be with his father , who was helping advise the training of the country 's police force under the shah , @entity221
@entity3 attended a @entity223 boarding school and later returned to the @entity96 region to enroll at @entity204 before heading to @entity22 for the first time in 1966
" i prided myself on being unflappable even in the most chaotic of circumstances , " he wrote
" that guise lasted until @entity22 , where i realized that i was dealing with human lives and if one were lost , it could never be replaced
i quickly learned that there was nothing wrong with being emotional
" he was commissioned a second lieutenant and served two tours of duty in @entity22 , where he received three @entity235
in 1983 , he led troops during the invasion of @entity238
@entity3 , who died in @entity239 , @entity196 , is survived by his wife , @entity241 , two daughters and a son
@entity0 's @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .
