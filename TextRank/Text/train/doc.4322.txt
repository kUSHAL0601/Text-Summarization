-- in march , 9 million viewers tuned in to @entity2 to watch a farm -- which served as a safe haven to survivors of a zombie apocalypse -- burn to the ground on " @entity8
" this sunday , @entity9 ( a @entity11 network , like @entity0 ) commences its second season of " @entity13 , " which sees a group of survivors fight back against alien invaders while their home state of @entity18 lies in ruins
switch over to @entity20 , and you 're likely to see promos for " revolution , " a series about what happens 15 years after the loss of all advanced technology and electronics
post-apocalyptic scenarios are cropping up all over the small screen -- oddly enough , in the year 2012
but is the runaway success of " @entity8 " the main reason for it , or is there something else going on here ? " there 's always a copycat trend in the industry , " tv critic @entity38 said , pointing to last year 's " @entity39 " and " @entity40 , " both of which drew comparisons to " @entity43
" " there 's no way executives are n't looking at the ratings for ' @entity8 ' and are n't salivating
" at the same time , he says , " revolution " has to forge its own creative path to survive
" everyone imitates everything that 's successful , " said fellow critic @entity52 , who does n't see it so much as a trend but as a coincidence
" or simply that ideas go in cycles
" indeed , tv has been down this road before , with the short - lived cult favorite " @entity66 " exploring a scenario of society rebuilding after a nuclear attack
@entity67 , an ethical futurist with a background in television , noted that various aspects of " @entity8 " are being replicated now : " the rule of tv production is to figure out what aspect of a surprisingly success show made it a winner
we 're seeing other comic book - based stories in development , other supernatural stories and other post-apocalypse stories
" actress @entity82 , whose character , @entity84 , was last seen having been " harnessed " by the aliens on " @entity13 , " actually took a look at " @entity8 " as a sort of homework assignment
" it was interesting to watch and take notes , and compare the similarities and differences , " she said , " to compare it to ' @entity13 ' to see what a world taken over by another species would be like
" @entity82 , also known for her recurring role as @entity98 on " @entity105 , " has another upcoming series , @entity104 's " @entity103 , " with something of a twist on the same themes : the crew of a submarine disobeys orders to avoid nuclear war and ends up retreating to an island
" they 're having to start over and form their own living and way of protecting themselves , " she explained
" even though it 's very different ( from ' @entity13 ' ) , it has that same theme of ' who do i trust ? ' " she said she and other actors on " @entity13 " asked themselves what they would do in a post-apocalyptic scenario like this
" what tools would i have to work with ? if i do n't have transportation or a gun or a knife or even a steak dinner , what am i actually feeling ? there 's a lot of desperation in that situation , but there can also be a lot of joy as well
" ' @entity13 ' cast and crew interviews " revolution 's " creator , @entity139 ( " @entity140 " ) , hopes to explore that joy or at least have more fun with it
" the apocalypse kind of bums me out , " he admitted in a meeting with @entity147 ' @entity146 when the series was being developed
@entity139 wanted to do a show based around the elements of @entity154 's " hero 's journey , " which were perhaps best exemplified in " @entity155
" the abrams team was looking at a series that began with the cataclysmic scenario of that loss of electricity and technology
instead of dealing with the immediate consequences of that event , " revolution " flashes forward 15 years later
" that is an interesting world , " @entity139 said
" it transforms into a kingdom with good warriors and bad warriors
that 's a world that 's gone back to swords
it 's about people living in a world that nature has reclaimed
" @entity139 can see the current mood being reflected in series in a post-apocalyptic vein
" there 's something in the collective zeitgeist that people feel we 're headed towards a cliff , " he said
" the population is massive , we 're separated from our food supply , we 're eventually going to run out of oil , and there 's international tensions
people feel like we 're really out of balance and due to be knocked down a peg by war or disease or something
" @entity139 wanted to explore the story on the " other end " of that
" we 're not interested in nihilism or hopelessness
we 'll all survive and be ok if we remember the things that bring us together : family , brotherhood and mercy
" ultimately , though , as @entity212 points out , " what ' revolution ' needs is what every show needs : five characters people care about
why the lights went out turns into a bit of boring trivia without that emotional investment
" the rules of great tv are the same , even when the world seems to be coming to an end .
