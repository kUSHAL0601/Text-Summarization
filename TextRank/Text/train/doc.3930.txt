@entity0 -- it 's a scene straight out of @entity3 : a princess in her royal wedding dress , riding in a horse - drawn carriage through majestic streets
that 's just what @entity9 may look like on her wedding day next month
@entity12 announced tuesday that a century - old gold - trimmed royal carriage will carry the new princess and her prince , @entity16 , from @entity17 through central @entity0 to the palace
the same carriage -- called the @entity20 -- has carried previous royal brides on their wedding days
@entity16 's mother , lady @entity23 , rode in it in 1981 after her marriage to @entity26 , and @entity27 traveled in it five years later after she wed prince @entity29
it was specifically built for @entity31 in 1902 to be used at his coronation , and it remains the most - used carriage in the @entity35 , usually used these days by @entity36 when she meets foreign heads of state
it is an open - top carriage , so if it rains , the new royal couple will instead travel in the enclosed @entity41 , another historic carriage , the palace announced
the glass coach was built in 1881 and purchased for use at @entity46 's coronation in 1911
princess @entity23 and @entity27 used it on their way to their weddings , along with three other brides : @entity52 , who married the future @entity53 in 1923 ; princess @entity54 in 1963 ; and @entity55 in 1973
the wedding procession will take in some of central @entity0 's most famous sights
after leaving the abbey , it will pass the @entity60 of @entity61 and @entity62 , the prime minister 's residence at @entity65 , the @entity66 and the @entity67 : the long avenue that stretches from @entity70 past @entity69 , straight to @entity12
as they make their way to the palace for their wedding reception , @entity9 and @entity16 will be at the head of a five - carriage procession
riding in the two carriages behind them will be the best man , @entity16 's brother , prince @entity80 ; the maid of honor , @entity9 's sister , @entity84 ; and the bridesmaids
the queen and her husband will travel in the next carriage , with prince @entity26 and his wife , @entity89 , and @entity9 's parents riding together in the last
eighteen horses will pull the five carriages , with the white - looking @entity93 , which are usually reserved for the queen , pulling the newlyweds
the carriages are maintained by @entity97 , whose family has been working in the mews for four generations
like everyone working in the palace , @entity101 has his own particular concern : " if the wheels fall off , then obviously i would lose my job , so that is a bit of a worry , " he said
@entity101 's key task on the big day will be " chocking , " which means fixing blocks of wood under the carriage wheels , so they do n't move as the passengers get in
as beautiful as they are , state carriages are n't always an easy way for passengers to travel
as the carriages move along , they swing around in a circular motion , which can make passengers feel queasy
between now and the wedding , however , @entity9 will have a chance to get used to the feeling -- and , crucially , to practice getting in and out
" i think she will wish to practice getting in and out of the carriages , because obviously , on the day , she will be wearing a dress with a large train , " @entity127 @entity126 said
" and it 's a quite difficult event to get into a carriage and get settled so it looks perfect , but i think she 's very excited about it
" @entity9 will take a more modern mode of transport to the abbey before the service , the palace announced
in fact , she plans to travel in the same @entity146 used by @entity26 and @entity89 , the @entity142 , when they were attacked by protesters in @entity0 in december , @entity12 said
" @entity146 1 , " which has glass in the back panels , is currently being repaired in readiness for for the april 29 wedding
" it 's actually designed with visibility in mind , so you actually probably get a better view in the @entity146 that she 's using than a closed carriage , " @entity152 manager @entity151 said
in december , students protesting increases in university costs hit the car with paint and cracked a window , as @entity26 and @entity89 rode through a crowd en route to a show in central @entity0
@entity1 's @entity169 contributed to this report .
