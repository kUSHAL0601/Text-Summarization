@entity2 -- " so gim me a stage where this bull here can rage
and though i can fight , i 'd much rather recite that 's entertainment ! " -- @entity9 , rehearsing his stage routine , from the movie " @entity8 " it sounded like a good way to pass a snowy @entity2 day when the rest of the federal government was shut down because of the weather : watch a potentially entertaining @entity18 oral argument , when the issue was about a @entity21 movie and the colorful life of a professional athlete
the appeal deals with a 1963 book and screenplay on the life of boxer @entity9 , the former middleweight champion who wrote it with his childhood friend and business partner @entity29
@entity9 's story was made into the 1980 movie " @entity8 , " starring actor @entity33
but the underlying issue tuesday was surely more dry : equitable defense and tolling for remedies in civil copyright claims
the dense subject matter was enough to temper the court 's creative , even mischievous streak -- no pop culture references to showbiz or sports ; no clever rhetoric about this being a " knockout " legal fight ; and no justice who would admit ever seeing the @entity51 - winning film
on purely aesthetic grounds , the justices ' public review of the case was a disappointing script , the ending of which wo n't be known for months
at issue is whether @entity29 's daughter waited too long to file a copyright infringement lawsuit over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story
her father died a year after the movie 's release
federal copyright law gave @entity69 the right to renew the copyrights before the term expired , which she did in 1991
but her lawsuit was not filed until 2009
@entity75 and @entity74 -- the movie 's distributor -- say that violates the established legal principle of " laches , " which bars most claims that are unreasonably delayed , on the theory it would unfairly burden the adverse party
both sides also dispute what ownership rights the studio retained after the elder @entity29 's death , and which were subsequently returned to his daughter
@entity69 claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay , and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights
@entity69 seeks damages dating back three years from the filing of the lawsuit , and an injunction on further distribution of the work without compensation
her lawyers claim the yearslong delay was caused by fear of retaliation , lack of money to file the suit and being told by the studio that " @entity8 " was no longer making money
@entity75 and @entity74 say they have invested heavily to convert the film to formats such as @entity111 for home viewing , and for overseas distribution
the companies say having an open - ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions
justice @entity119 posed tough questions for both sides
" you see , counselor , this is my problem
i sort of disagree with you fundamentally , because i do n't know that you 're entitled to injunctive relief , " she told @entity29 's lawyer , @entity125
" the government says you might be entitled to payment for the use of your copyright because it belongs to you and there should n't be some adverse possession right that the other side gets
but in terms of injunctive relief , given their [ studio 's ] reliance on your failure to act for 18 years , they should n't be put out of business and told that they ca n't continue in their business
" later , the studio 's attorney @entity145 called the plaintiff 's claims a " bizarre argument
" he added @entity29 sought to " skim the cream " and pick an opportune time to file her claim , after the studio invested so much in the movie over the years
" what 's so bad about that ? " asked @entity119
" you 've gotten a lot of profits in those 18 years and , in fact , at one point when she did reach out to you , you told her , ' why sue ? you 're not going to get any money
we 're not making any
' " the movie won two @entity51 , including best actor for @entity33 , who portrayed the boxer
@entity9 is 92 and not a party in the appeal
the fighter also known as the " @entity9 " held the middleweight title from 1949 - 51
the case is @entity174 ( 12 - 1315 ) .
