@entity0 -- when thousands of children fled violence and poverty in @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 and surged toward the borders of other nations , it was seen as a humanitarian crisis and they were considered refugees
but a huge influx of young migrants from @entity18 , many telling @entity15 workers they are trying to escape drug cartels , gang violence , murder and rape as they stream across the southern border , have so far not been conveyed the same status
the contrast in what politicians on both sides of the aisle and others have characterized as a humanitarian crisis has introduced new complexity to @entity18 's toxic debate on immigration
the @entity15 high commissioner for refugees is pushing for the @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity18 countries to treat many of the children as " refugees , " which could prompt more from @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 to seek asylum
however , the @entity46 has said most wo n't qualify as refugees to stay in the country
" we do n't want to send people back into harm 's way ... but the more they expand access to asylum , the more people will feel they have a case , " said @entity48 , a senior associate for regional security for @entity50 , a nonprofit humanitarian organization
different approaches president @entity61 wants $ 3.7 billion from @entity62 to help address the problem
the emergency money would go to detention facilities for housing children while they await hearings and for legal aid to help sift through a backlog of immigration cases
there is no appetite for @entity61 's plan among @entity74 in @entity62
one of them , @entity77 sen. @entity76 , said it would perpetuate the crisis
others said it 's too expensive and it would be cheaper to simply fly the kids home
a bipartisan measure by @entity74 sen. @entity85 and @entity87 rep. @entity86 , both of @entity89 , aims to quickly send most young migrants home by changing a 2008 law that now requires all unaccompanied minors who are n't from @entity37 or @entity93 to receive a hearing before deportation
the plan , which may have wider support , troubles some lawmakers , especially those in the @entity100 , who worry that children who could possibly qualify for asylum wo n't have time to properly plead their cases
" you ca n't in 72 hours go ahead and make the case that your father got murdered in front of you
you ca n't make the case that the gang said ' join us or die , ' if you do n't have the time to produce documents , affidavits , certificates and what not
and so it is unacceptable to me to basically have a deal that undermines all those rights , " said sen. @entity118 , a @entity119 @entity74
a word loaded with political implications there is important nuance and distinction in calling the surge a " humanitarian crisis " while steering clear of deeming the migrants " refugees , " international policy and humanitarian aid experts say
the difference determines who gets asylum and who goes back
what 's the difference between immigrant and refugee ? it 's a difference the @entity15 is pressing @entity0 to reconsider
" we recognize the enormous challenges facing the @entity36 and other countries as a result of this large movement of people , " @entity143 , the @entity15 refugees commission regional representative in the @entity36 , said in a statement advocating broader refugee status
" we 're witnessing a complex situation in which children are leaving home for a variety of reasons , including poverty , the desire to join family , and the growing influence of trafficking networks
within this movement , there are also children who are fleeing situations of violence at the hands of transnational organized criminal groups and powerful local gangs , " @entity143 said
@entity171 , an international migration professor at @entity172 and the author of several books on humanitarian crises , said @entity36 law is ambiguous as to whether the children in this case " meet the definition of a refugee
" humanitarian crisis ... in @entity18 ? they would have to prove they fear persecution on the basis of their race , religion , nationality , political perspectives or membership in a particular social group , @entity182 said
violent threats , the type many have apparently told @entity15 workers they face from drug cartels and gangs at home , are n't always enough to qualify for asylum , immigration legal scholars and humanitarian aid workers said
humanitarian aid groups argue the level of violence by organized crime syndicates in @entity42 , @entity44 and @entity43 is so high that the children are basically fleeing warfare
however , some anti-immigration groups have argued that by helping the minors , the @entity36 government is actually aiding cartels profiting from smuggling
the @entity61 administration has said it is approaching the situation as a humanitarian crisis and there is no need , beyond a monitoring role , for the @entity15 to get involved
the @entity220 will conduct interviews with the kids and their legal representatives to determine who might be deemed " refugees
" unintended consequences : 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis " obviously , we 're -- we have a far different circumstance than , say , @entity7 , " @entity232 spokeswoman @entity231 told reporters earlier this month the situation was " far different " than similar migrant outflows in @entity7 and other conflict zones
typically , she said , the @entity15 refugee agency " conducts these interviews in countries where the host government is not capable or willing to conduct these interviews
and obviously , the @entity36 -- that 's a process that we undergo ourselves
" the witch 's brew : desperation , hope and children on the border but the problem is a hydra and will be difficult for federal officials to stem the tide , @entity249 , a @entity1 contributor , wrote recently
most wo n't be allowed to stay @entity46 spokesman @entity255 has said the children who have been detained " will go through the immigration court process " and it 's unlikely that most who do so " will qualify " for asylum to stay in the country
" in the view of this @entity46 , an immigration judge should make the determination about whether someone qualified for refugee status , " @entity255 told reporters on wednesday
there 's the matter of perception , @entity182 said , adding that terms such as " refugee " engender sympathy in a way " immigrant " might not
for some people , the image of " kids being queue - jumpers " raises hackles , she added
" as to why @entity36 are more favorably inclined to aid those who are in need of protection elsewhere than those in their back yard , i think that ambivalence about immigration begins to override the humanitarian instinct when people are seeking to enter the country , " @entity182 said
those feelings are reflected in the emotionally - charged protests that have sprung up in such places as @entity294 , @entity295 , and @entity296 , @entity77 , and polls
one released this week by the @entity298 found that 53 % of @entity36 surveyed supports expediting the legal process for the @entity18 immigrant children even if it results in kids who could have received asylum being deported
a @entity304 poll also released this week showed 58 % of @entity36 surveyed disapprove of @entity61 's handling of the situation
@entity89 governor lashes out at @entity61 over immigration crisis still , some political analysts and humanitarian groups have been stunned by the level of political vitriol and lack of broader public outcry
" there 's no big outcry , " demanding these kids stay in the @entity36 , @entity48 said , adding that this is surprising since this is " the worst humanitarian crisis in the @entity321
" @entity1 senior political analyst @entity322 likened the calls for mass deportation to a boat of @entity327 refugees who sought safety in @entity18 as @entity329 loomed
they too , @entity322 said , faced political backlash in an anti-immigration climate and were sent back to @entity333 where one - third of them were killed by @entity335
" seventy - five years later , we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from @entity18 escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom , " @entity322 wrote in an op - ed for @entity1
" while certainly no @entity348 , the growing humanitarian crisis in their home countries is glaring as rising murder rates for youths are a driving force behind the mass exodus
how will we respond this time ? " @entity322 asked
