-- @entity1 defended itself sunday from criticism from a family after a dolphin bit their 8 - year - old daughter at the @entity8 attraction
a video posted online shows the girl standing along the edge of a pool , one of several people feeding dolphins
after she picks up a paper plate that once held the marine mammal 's food , a dolphin lunges at her and bites her hand
the dolphin let go after a few seconds , but not before leaving three puncture wounds on the girl 's hand
in a statement , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity24 said on - site " educators and animal care staff ... immediately connected with the family
in addition , a member of our health services team was in the area at @entity34 and quickly responded and treated the young girl
" yet in an interview with @entity0 @entity41 affiliate @entity40 , the family at the center of the november 21 incident faulted the central @entity44 attraction 's staff for not warning them the dolphins might bite and for their response after the girl was injured
" we felt powerless , " the girl 's father , @entity49 , said in explaining their decision to post a video on @entity54
" we thought , look , we 've got this video , let 's make it public , and let 's try to put some pressure on @entity1 to make some changes
" the 8 - year - old , @entity62 , said she " accidentally held " up the paper plate , after which the dolphin " jumped up and ate the carton and bit my hand
" " i was thinking it was going to haul me into the water , " she said
" and this is a little crazy , but i thought it was ... going to eat my hand off
" @entity49 said those feeding the dolphins were told the paper plate should stay on the wall , " but we really did n't know why
" no one signed a disclaimer , and there were no signs indicating any risk , the father said
the girl 's mother , @entity84 , said she was upset about @entity1 staffers ' response
" they did not tell us to look out for any signs of infection , " the mother said
" we had to ask for @entity93
" the @entity49 family never contacted @entity1 after leaving the park , @entity24 said
she defended the attraction and its protocol , including " specific instructions to not pick up the paper trays at any time
" " our guests are given clear instructions on how to feed the dolphins in an appropriate and safe way , " @entity24 said
" ... unfortunately , there are times when instructions are not followed
" race is on to find @entity110 dolphin killers video : @entity112 is reunited with its rescuers
