-- @entity1 and her @entity2 Â© were supposed to be married in july on a pavilion in @entity4 , @entity5 , against the backdrop of the @entity7
but @entity8 had other plans
today , that same pavilion is under several feet of water , in a surge of flooding that has swept through several @entity5 towns
at the height of wedding season , @entity1 must now find a different venue
" i never would have thought , never would have imagined this would happen , " @entity18 told @entity0 affiliate @entity19
in several cities across the state , communities are moving fast to protect their neighborhoods from rising floodwaters
in @entity4 , residents are using pumps to remove water from their properties , said meteorologist @entity30 at the @entity31
and along the @entity34 -- a tributary of the @entity7 -- the community of @entity37 has only one road to get around town , @entity30 said
residents of @entity39 are continuing to pile sandbags up to 5 feet high to protect their homes and businesses
people , wading through the high floodwaters , are building dikes to prepare for the rain forecasted for saturday and sunday
" the summers is pretty much over , " said @entity47 to @entity0 affiliate @entity48
" nobody wants to swim in this now
" a particularly wet year is likely to blame for the floods
with just over 25 inches of rain since the beginning of 2014 , the @entity53 are on track to have the wettest year on record , @entity30 said
and heavy rain continued to fall in several cities -- prior @entity60 included -- through the start of the weekend
but there could be an end in sight
though the torrential rains continue , they 'll likely have little to no effect on water levels because the @entity5 rivers are starting to recede , @entity30 said
" it 's a very slow process , but the water levels are indeed going out
