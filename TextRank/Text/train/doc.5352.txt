@entity0 always had the teaching bug in him
after graduating from @entity2 in 2002 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science , he turned down industry jobs to teach in the @entity6
a few years later he got a masters degree in education from @entity9 and then went to @entity10 to work as a software developer
but he could n't stop teaching
before he arrived at the office every morning , @entity0 drove to a nearby high school and taught first - period computer science
he told colleagues and friends about his experience and recruited them to teach in local schools
in 2009 @entity0 launched @entity20 in @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , an initiative that places high - tech professionals as part - time teachers in high schools
@entity0 's goal was to see to it that every high school in the country has a computer - science course
he thought he might need to quit his job to manage the growing effort
but he did n't have to
@entity10 offered to support @entity0 , asking him to devote all his workday time to it
the company 's decision to incubate the @entity22 program stems partly from founder @entity40 's longstanding interest in promoting education , @entity10 's broader philanthropic focus and a pressing , industry - wide need for more engineers
" @entity45 produces the best computer engineers in the world , " said @entity0 , " but we just do n't have enough
" which is why @entity22 has over 100 volunteers covering 35 schools in seven states , and is now mounting a big push in @entity53
falling behind ? in february of this year , @entity40 joined @entity55 's @entity54 and other tech titans in a video by nonprofit @entity58 to encourage interest among young people in programming
demand for top tech talent also has prompted the industry to lobby the @entity65 to give out more @entity67 visas to highly skilled foreign - born immigrants
in april , @entity54 penned an op - ed in the @entity69 calling for revised immigration policies so that @entity45 companies can better attract the most talented foreign - born computer scientists
computer science is the third highest - paying bachelor degree , right behind computer engineering and chemical engineering
while the average starting salary for computer science college graduates is $ 64,400 , industry insiders frequently cite higher figures
in large or competitive companies like @entity82 or @entity55 , starting salary for the cream of the crop college graduates is nearly $ 100,000 , not counting bonuses or stock options
despite the financial appeal , there are n't enough computer programmers entering the @entity45 workforce to fill the estimated 150,000 new computing jobs that will be produced every year for the next decade
this adds to anxiety among industry professionals and policy leaders that the @entity45 could fall behind other countries in innovation if it does n't foster education in @entity100 ( science , technology , engineering and math )
part of the problem is that the @entity45 lacks enough computer science teachers , said @entity0
recent graduates with a computer science degree are far more likely to go into the tech industry , where offers are more lucrative
early exposure to computer science can lead students to develop an aptitude or liking for the subject , apply for opportunities like tech internships , and pursue it as a career path
but even as technology becomes an integral part of most people 's lives , fewer computer - science courses are being offered in high schools
perhaps as a result , computer - science tests account for just 0.69 % of all high school @entity131 tests taken
and yet knowledge of computer programming is becoming more critical in the workplace
" computer science is permeating every industry and every field , and its importance will only grow , " said @entity0
" whether it 's biology , finance , architecture , or a host of other disciplines , a basic computer literacy is critical
" @entity22 in @entity53 that the @entity45 produces so few graduates in a field that will grow in importance makes the demand - supply problem only more urgent
@entity53 mayor @entity148 , never one to shy away from national issues , tried in 2011 to jumpstart the city 's tech scene with the proposal to build a world - class engineering campus
when the mayor 's office heard about @entity22 after the @entity157 ran an article about it in fall 2012 , officials reached out to @entity0 and asked him to bring the program to @entity53
with help from the mayor 's @entity161 , @entity22 began setting up and recruiting volunteers
in march , @entity0 appeared at a @entity53 tech meetup to invite the city 's tech community to get involved
a plug from venture capitalist and blogger @entity169 also helped generate interest
interviews with applicants , conducted jointly with nine participating high schools , started this month
@entity0 is curious to see how the composite of the volunteer force shapes up since few major technology companies are headquartered in @entity53
selected volunteers will go through an intensive training program in the summer so that they can use a standardized curriculum and learn how to manage classrooms by the fall
since tech professionals often have flexible working hours , the program places them in first - period classes , which usually ends shortly after 9 a.m. volunteers are paid a small stipend to cover transportation costs
but as @entity0 put it , " no one is doing this for the money
" @entity193 , a @entity10 employee , began teaching at a @entity195 school last september and tries to appeal to students ' creativity
" if there is one thing we try to avoid in our class , it is ( being ) boring
we often try to show how deeply computer science has altered our world , " he said
" we even have some students who plan to code artistic projects
i think @entity208 was spot on when he called computer science a liberal art. " bad numbers , big gains about 80 % of @entity22 ' volunteers are @entity10 employees , part of a push by the company to address the dearth of engineering talent in the @entity45 the program is also part of the @entity224 initiative , which seeks to provide better access to education for young people worldwide
for @entity228 , ceo and founder of the @entity21 in the @entity231 , area , @entity22 was a boon
" we were excited that it could help us identify extremely qualified teachers to staff a very difficult field , " he said
" we specifically pushed for @entity100 courses in our schools
kids are judged on ability , and the ability to code is going to help them a long way in tomorrow 's world
" the numbers suggest @entity0 has an uphill battle
in 2012 , only 61 students took advanced - placement computer science in the entire state of @entity249 , for example
in the nation 's capital , it 's the same number
but @entity0 is taking an optimistic view
" the numbers are so bad that anything we can do is a huge , huge gain , " he told @entity255
@entity0 needs more students like @entity261 , a senior taking a @entity22 @entity131 course at @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity231 , who said , " it is a dream of mine to someday work as a software engineer or programmer graphic artist in video games
" what would really help , @entity0 said , is if states recognized computer science as a core requirement rather than an elective
" it really should be the fourth science course in high school , right beside biology , physics and chemistry , " he said
" if the next generation in this country is going to compete successfully for 21st - century jobs , they 're going to need to know computer science
