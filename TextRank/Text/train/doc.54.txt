-- @entity1 on tuesday defended @entity2 against " a noisy minority " in @entity4 and described some @entity6 ' legislative tactics to defund the landmark program as " deeply distressing " and " bad politics
" " this president is not going to agree to defund health care , " @entity9 said at a health panel just before president @entity11 was to make an appearance
" if they want to vote to shut the government down , that 's on their head and their responsibility and if they go even further , which is deeply distressing , and for the first time lead our country into default on our obligations that is not just partisan politics , " @entity9 said at the @entity15 established by her husband , who was also in attendance
8 answers on @entity2 and the shutdown a default would go to " the heart of our credibility around the world -- not just our economic leadership but our political and strategic leadership , " @entity9 said
" so i hope our friends on the other side of the aisle -- and it 's a minority , but it 's a noisy minority -- understands this is not right to do , and this is bad politics to do
" later in the panel , @entity11 and former president @entity9 -- both @entity49 -- defended the health care reform
@entity11 said some @entity6 ' effort to resist the reform -- making it no. 1 on their agenda -- " is wrong
" opponents of the health care law are trying to " scare " @entity57 about the program , @entity11 said
" so what you have had is an unprecedented effort , that you have seen ramp up over the last month or so , in which those who have opposed the idea of universal health care in the first place , and have fought this thing tooth and nail through @entity4 and through the courts and so forth , are -- have been trying to scare and discourage people from getting a good deal , " @entity11 said
" and so some of you may have seen some of the commercials out there that are a little wacky
" @entity9 praised the health initiative , saying it will make @entity57 " healthier " in the next decade
how long can @entity1 wait ?
