-- scientists at @entity3 's @entity2 are touting a new prototype vaccine to prevent breast cancer as " promising
" this follows tests performed on mice by the researchers
the scientists said a single vaccination was shown to prevent breast cancer tumors from forming in mice , and also stymied the growth of existing tumors
the vaccine contains a protein found in most breast cancers , but not found in healthy women , except during lactation , according to dr. @entity19 , the study 's principal investigator and an immunologist at the @entity2 's @entity22
@entity19 says this allows the vaccine to direct a woman 's immune system to target this protein without damaging healthy breast tissue
" we can protect women from breast cancer , but if it destroyed their normal breast , it 's an unacceptable side - effect , so we had to avoid that , " @entity19 said
@entity19 now wants to move forward in testing the vaccine in human patients
enrollment could begin next year according to the @entity2
@entity19 acknowledges cancers have been cured in mice before without that success transitioning to humans , but thinks this vaccine 's chances of success are " promising
" " it 's kind of like an application of immunologic judo , using the natural changes that occur in a woman 's needs , " said @entity19
" a decrease in the use of the breast for breastfeeding , and an increase in the breast 's risk of developing tumors
we 're taking advantage of that
that has n't been done before
" the inspiration for the research comes from the childhood vaccination program that has been successful in preventing diseases like polio and measles , according to @entity19
" it just struck me as a giant hole in our health care that we do n't have preventive vaccines that mimic the childhood vaccination program for adult diseases like breast cancer , " said @entity19
the tests have been restricted to mice so far
@entity19 said the @entity78 will guide researchers through what type of toxicity studies they want done , and usually they require other species -- rats , for example
@entity19 says he does n't anticipate any difference in results between mice and rats , but he would not second - guess the @entity78 on their request for tests on different species
the @entity78 has granted approval to two cancer - prevention vaccines : cervical and liver cancer
however , these vaccines target viruses , while the one tested by the @entity2 targets cancer formation
if any human testing proves successful , the strategy would be to vaccinate women 40 and over as well as younger women with a heightened risk of breast cancer
@entity19 says there is no funding for human trials at this point , but it has been applied for
however , he speculates it will take at least 10 years to get the vaccine to normal , healthy women at risk of developing the cancer
" we have to try it
it looks to me to be extremely promising , and until i see a better idea i 'd like to try this
