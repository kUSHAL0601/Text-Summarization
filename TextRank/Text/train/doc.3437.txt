-- the old adage has it that you wait ages for one bus then two come along at once -- but @entity6 is n't complaining
three months ago he won his first @entity9 title at the @entity10 on his eighth year on the tour , but he did n't have to wait long for his second
after a round of 63 at @entity14 in @entity15 he finished one shot ahead of the field to take the @entity19 title and secure an early birthday present ahead of turning 35 on thursday
a run of four birdies in the final six holes saw @entity6 finish on 17 - under par , one shot ahead of fellow @entity27 @entity26 , and two clear of @entity28
" i think @entity31 taught me a lot , " @entity6 told the @entity30 's official website
" it was stay patient , stay focused , do n't get bent out of shape when you make a bogey or any of that kind of stuff
" it took me a long time to do it and i feel like i did learn a lot that week
i felt very calm and under control , that 's what you 've got to do when it 's time want to win
" today was awesome , i felt in control all day , of my emotions mentally and physically , and it was really cool golf
" i stayed patient , i did n't make any bogeys , i made a really key par putt on 14 and then the string of birdies there was pretty awesome
" @entity6 was one of only two players to stay bogey - free on sunday and after going 188 starts without a @entity30 win , it has taken him just five more to lock down a second
he credits the work he 's done with famed coach @entity62 in the past year , who has also worked with @entity64 and @entity65 , for transforming his game
" when i went and saw him , he said i believe in you and i believe you 've got a lot of talent , and i think you 're under utilizing what you 've got , " @entity6 said
" he 's a very confident person
when he tells you something , you believe it
