@entity0 , @entity1 -- deaths in @entity1 related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000 , the @entity3 said tuesday , and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water - borne disease
two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the @entity11 - @entity1 border in december
statistics released by the @entity14 , @entity12 - based organization @entity3 on tuesday show 1,937 people have died in the raging epidemic from the 38,334 who contracted the disease since its outbreak in august
cholera has spread to neighboring countries @entity11 and @entity23
the epidemic comes at a time when president @entity27 's government is facing its worst economic crisis , manifested in shortages of all essentials from food , fuel , cash , foreign currency and electricity and a hyperinflationary economy
health experts have said @entity0 's failure to import adequate stocks of water - treating chemicals is the main driver of the disease
most residents have resorted to rivers and shallow wells for drinking water , because taps are usually dry
on top of that problem , the waste - disposing system has collapsed
children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in @entity1
last month , @entity27 's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency
since then , international governments and organizations such as @entity3 , @entity63 , @entity59 , @entity60 and other @entity62 groups have moved in to combat the disease that has engulfed all of @entity1 's provinces
but the situation has not immediately improved
@entity1 health minister @entity70 warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops
@entity0 issued a warning monday that some parts of the country are going to experience floods during rainy season , further compounding the fight against the disease
the season peaks in january or february and ends in late march
@entity27 and rival @entity82 signed a power - sharing deal in september to run the government after a hotly contested presidential election
it was widely hoped that the deal would be the panacea to the humanitarian and economic problems bewildering the once - prosperous @entity1 , but the pact is yet to take effect
the sides continue to debate the sharing of key @entity97 ministries such as information , local government , finance , defense and home affairs .
