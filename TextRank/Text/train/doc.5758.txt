@entity0 -- @entity3 chairman @entity2 , @entity4 , will unveil a highly anticipated 2012 @entity6 budget next week that proposes dramatic changes to political lightning rods : entitlements
the plan , to be released tuesday , calls for a controversial overhaul of @entity12 , the health care program for seniors , and imposes deep cuts in @entity16 , which provides health benefits to low - income @entity18 , according to @entity3 @entity6 sources with knowledge of the proposal
starting 10 years from now , in 2021 , @entity18 would no longer enroll in the @entity12 program , but instead receive vouchers for private insurance , according to the @entity6 sources , who stressed anyone 55 or older now would not be affected by the change
the plan is modeled after one @entity2 proposed last year with @entity30 , budget director under president @entity31
details of how @entity12 voucher program would work are still unclear , but the @entity35 plan said the amount of the voucher -- a lump sum payment from the government -- would be calculated in part by taking the average federal cost per @entity12 enrollee
the @entity6 aims to save billions of dollars in revamping @entity12 , a large contributor to the massive federal deficit and debt
sources said they did not yet know how much savings @entity2 would project by drastically changing the @entity12 program
on @entity16 , @entity2 's plan calls for deep cuts , as much as $ 1 trillion
the program would also fundamentally change -- the federal share of the @entity16 system would become block grants to the states
@entity1 has been told that the @entity3 @entity6 budget plan does not call for significant change to the @entity58 program
@entity6 argue that while @entity58 is a factor in the nation 's fiscal crisis , it does n't contribute as much to the soaring debt as @entity12
two @entity3 @entity6 lawmakers briefed on the proposal told @entity1 they and others on the @entity67 believe it 's a mistake not to tackle @entity58
as for so - called discretionary spending , one of the sources -- who would not speak on the record before the plan is publicly announced -- said @entity2 's proposal promises to roll back spending to 2006 levels
it 's unclear how much that would slash , but it is expected to be far more than the roughly $ 61 billion in spending cuts @entity82 passed in february
@entity2 is expected to give specifics on how much savings the plan would create when it is unveiled tuesday
a @entity6 source said even with the major cuts and changes in @entity2 's proposal -- essentially a blueprint that guides spending decisions and does not go to the president for his signature -- it would not bring the budget into balance for many years
still , @entity6 sources briefed on the plan said it would save hundreds of billions of dollars more than the president 's proposed 2012 budget , and trillions over the next 10 years
the budget would also cut the corporate tax rate , but at the same time do away with tax loopholes for corporations
@entity2 's plan also provides for a permanent extension of all the @entity107 - era tax cuts , which under a compromise with president @entity109 were extended last year through 2012
@entity3 @entity6 leaders have been signaling for some time that they plan dramatic and controversial changes to entitlement programs in order to rein in the budget deficit and debt
knowing that the proposed changes will be politically risky and elicit an onslaught of criticism , @entity2 and @entity6 whip @entity116 have been holding sessions two or three times a week with @entity3 @entity6 to try to arm them with information about the gravity of the debt problem and why it needs to be fixed
@entity1 was allowed into one of these meetings last month , and heard @entity2 lay out for his @entity6 colleagues in stark terms what he calls the " tidal wave " of debt the country is facing
" the @entity134 has this economic model where they measure the economy going forward , and they are telling us that the entire economy crashes in the year 2037 because their computer simulation ca n't conceive of any way in which the @entity18 economy can continue , " @entity2 told the @entity6 group
" by the time my kids are my age , just those three programs -- @entity58 , @entity16 and @entity12 -- will consume all federal revenues
there will be no room for anything else in the federal budget , " @entity2 said
when @entity2 proposed a version of his @entity12 overhaul idea last year , known as his " road map , " @entity150 skewered it and tried to use it as a campaign weapon against republicans across the country
@entity109 has often said it is important for @entity0 to address entitlement spending
but the president has not offered any specific proposals , and @entity6 suggest he wants them to take the first risky steps
multiple @entity6 sources admit the timing of @entity2 's 2012 budget proposal is tricky
it will be released in the middle of down - to - the - wire , contentious negotiations with @entity150 about a spending measure to keep the government running for the rest of this 2011 fiscal year
@entity1 has been told that @entity6 leaders considered delaying the release of @entity2 's budget until this year 's spending differences are resolved
however , they decided to go ahead with it in hopes showing major cuts and reforms planned for next year will calm rank - and - file conservatives who feel the leadership is too compromising on spending cuts .
