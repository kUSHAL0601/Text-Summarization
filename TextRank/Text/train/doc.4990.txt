-- no checks ? no worries
or for some veterans , at least not as many worries , for a while
nearly 40,000 @entity7 veterans wounded on or after september 11 , 2001 , will each get a $ 500 check to help their families even if deadlocked @entity10 can not not find a deal to resolve the partial government shutdown , one of the nation 's largest veterans service groups promised tuesday
@entity17 , executive director of @entity19 - based @entity18 , announced on @entity0 's " @entity20 " the organization will spend $ 20 million providing wounded veterans with stipend checks should their disability benefits not be issued by the federal government , which is still deeply entrenched in a bitter partisan standoff 15 days after the shutdown began
he did not specify when the checks would be sent
7 crazy side effects from the shutdown testifying before the @entity33 last week , secretary of veterans affairs @entity31 warned that if the shutdown continues , on november 1 , the agency will not be able to pay all of its 3.8 million beneficiaries , far outnumbering @entity18 's 40,000 , who are counting on their checks
the payments would amount to $ 6.25 billion in compensation and pensions , survivor benefits , educational vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits , @entity31 said
" i need the authorization , appropriations and a budget to be able to do that , " he told committee members
" let us get back to work
the sooner we do it the faster i get back up to full speed
" also at risk are some 435,000 veterans in the @entity57 's disability claims backlog who will now have to wait longer for their applications to be handled because the agency has stopped paying overtime to processors who were trying to cut the backlog
if there 's a deal , what next ? @entity18 's announcement came as nearly 100 veterans from a coalition of the nation 's leading veterans and uniformed services organizations made their angry push tuesday at @entity10 's @entity74 to end the shutdown
former army capt. @entity76 , chief policy officer for @entity77 and @entity78 , pointed his frustration at what he considered a politically insolvent @entity81
" @entity84 , this is a game to them -- they 're scoring points , they 're poll testing what they 're saying
outside of the @entity92 , these are people 's lives , " he said
