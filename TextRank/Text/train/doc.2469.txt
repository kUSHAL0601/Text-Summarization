-- @entity1 hated the stares
whenever his family went out to eat , strangers ' eyes would follow -- gawking at the sizes of father and son , judging the food on their plates
at 5 feet 7 inches , @entity1 weighed 321 pounds
his son , @entity11 , was 5 feet 3 inches and weighed 333 pounds
" it 's like they 'd never seen a fat person before , " @entity1 recalls
for @entity1 , the decision to go through with weight loss surgery was about stopping those stares , getting in shape and , most importantly , saving his son 's life
in denial when his dad first approached him about going to a weight loss clinic , 17 - year - old @entity22 was hesitant
unlike many children who are bullied because of their weight , @entity11 had a lot of friends and did n't really see his size as an issue
@entity11 was more concerned about his dad 's health
@entity1 was on medication for acid reflux disease , hypertension and high cholesterol
" to think that , that young , i might lose him before i was 20 -- it 's not something you want , " @entity11 says
" and i always thought if i kept going down the same path , i would be like him or worse
" still , @entity11 was nervous
maybe , he thought , i 'll just try dieting again
@entity45 stops many people from getting weight loss procedures done , says dr. @entity48 , the @entity1 's doctor and a bariatric surgeon in @entity50
but often the biggest obstacle is denial -- they do n't want to admit they ca n't do it on their own
" the hardest thing for patients to do is pick up the phone and go see a doctor , " @entity48 says
" they see it as a kind of defeat
" bariatric surgery does n't help obese live longer , study finds there are several types of bariatric surgery
most cost between $ 18,000 and $ 30,000
gastric bypass has been the " gold standard , " @entity48 says , since the 1990s
with gastric bypass , a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created laparoscopically by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines
@entity1 knew about gastric bypass but did n't like how invasive it was ; he did n't know if he wanted to restructure his internal organs that way
then he started seeing commercials for @entity84
the @entity85 approved @entity87 's @entity86 in february 2011
( @entity48 sits on @entity87 's doctor approval board
) the first adjustable gastric band , @entity91 's realize , was approved in 2007
both bands are placed laparoscopically around the upper portion of the stomach in an outpatient procedure that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour
the devices can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor 's visits , helping patients " feel full faster , eat less and lose weight
" and unlike gastric bypass , adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed
the @entity85 has approved the @entity84 for patients over 18 with a @entity103 over 40 , or patients with a @entity103 over 30 who also have a serious obesity - related condition like high - blood pressure or sleep apnea
surgery no quick fix for obese teens @entity1 had a @entity103 of 50
his son 's was 59
" with all the excess weight on him , it was putting so much stress on his heart , " @entity1 says
" for me this would be a good thing
" two years , 200 pounds shortly after @entity121 2009 , @entity1 and @entity11 were ready for surgery
@entity1 was ready to give up the @entity124 food he loved as a child ; @entity11 was determined to no longer constantly eat just because he was bored
they had completed all the prerequisites
@entity48 asks patients to lose 5 to 10 pounds before undergoing anesthesia , to ensure they 're willing to make the serious commitment that 's forthcoming
he stresses that the @entity84 is just a tool to help patients lose weight
" the main thing we talk about is motivation , " @entity48 says
" if they ca n't change their lifestyle , they are n't going to lose more than 30 to 40 pounds
" that might seem like a lot to some , but most who undergo the surgery have 80 to 100 pounds to lose
and if they do n't eat right and exercise , they 'll most likely gain it all back
the @entity148 also knew about the risks
the @entity85 lists possible complications from the @entity84 procedure : vomiting , difficulty swallowing , gastroesophageal reflux disease , abdominal pain , pulmonary embolism or leaking that could lead to death
weight - loss surgery may raise risk of alcohol abuse fortunately , their dual procedures went smoothly
@entity1 and @entity11 were on a liquid diet for two weeks after surgery , and then ate only soft foods for another two weeks
it would be several more weeks before they learned what they could eat and how much
" you have to chew your food really well , 20 to 25 times before you swallow , " @entity1 says
" the more fibrous vegetables , they do n't digest as well
the skin of peaches , apples , do n't digest well
" carbohydrates are pretty much off - limits as well , @entity11 says
before the surgery , he would usually have a sandwich , chips and soda or a few pieces of pizza for lunch
now he eats maybe half a chicken breast and half a cucumber
dinners used to be double servings
now he orders off the kids ' menu at restaurants and can barely eat half
" when food gets stuck , it 's painful
it feels like you 're having a heart attack or something , " @entity11 says
the results , though , have been phenomenal
@entity11 has dropped 160 pounds ; his dad has lost more than 100
" it 's been fun and exciting to watch them , " says his mom , @entity203
@entity11 is always out now , compared to what he used to be
and my husband ... he likes to share his story with everybody
even with people he does n't even know
" @entity11 was named @entity48 's patient of the month
" he was so shy and introverted , never looked people in the eye , " @entity48 says
" when he lost 100 pounds he opened up and came out of his shell
plus the guy ate chicken all day long
" @entity48 likes when family members tackle weight loss together
they motivate each other to stick with the diet , keep junk food out of the house and keep moving
@entity11 and @entity1 had a sense of competition -- when his dad was losing weight more quickly , @entity11 took up basketball to catch up
at 170 pounds , @entity11 is almost to his goal weight of 150
he plans to swim more and try other activities that he could n't do when he was bigger
he also hopes to help other obese teens by sharing his story
@entity1 is working on reaching his goal weight as well
he knows as an adult it 's more difficult to lose the weight , but he keeps pushing forward
" i really want to be as healthy as possible for my family
