@entity1 it 's a tiger 's tail
that 's what @entity6 citizens say they saw thursday in woods and other areas not far from @entity1 , according to a local official
while authorities have n't managed to corner the animal , all witnesses identified it as a tiger , according to @entity15 , mayoral cabinet director in @entity17
the town 's @entity19 page indicates the animal is young
@entity17 mayor @entity22 told @entity2 affiliate @entity23 that authorities believe the tiger was domesticated , though an investigation is ongoing
as the hunt for the cat continues , local residents were told to stay inside and , if they have to go out , to drive rather than walk
both @entity30 and @entity31 are adjacent to the @entity33 amusement park , which is about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of @entity1
yet there was no mention of the feline on the @entity37 , and park spokeswoman @entity38 said the park 's security team -- while it was working closely with local authorities -- was never asked to reinforce their security
@entity38 said operations were n't being affected at the park , which she described as closed and well guarded
dear or alive , hunt for man - eating tiger wo n't end well for conservationist @entity2 's @entity49 contributed to this report .
