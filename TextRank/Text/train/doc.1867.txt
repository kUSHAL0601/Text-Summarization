-- i had an experience recently that reinvigorated my faith in humanity -- and bureaucracy
i 'd left my suitcase in the trunk of a yellow cab in @entity9 and did n't realize it till 20 minutes later
i did not have a receipt or any way to identify the cab or the driver
i was at the start of a four - day , three - city trip
for almost three hours , various people tried to help me -- two folks at my bank , whose credit card held the only record of the cab ride ; three people at two yellow cab companies based in @entity25 ; a service rep at the @entity27 ; people in my office back in @entity29
as the workday ended , i finally went to the drugstore for some toiletries
my fiancee shipped me some clothes , and i retreated glumly to my hotel room
then , at 9:48 p.m. , @entity37 from the @entity38 called me
she 'd been working overtime on my case , used gps records to identify the cab and located and called the cabbie -- and he still had my bag ! he was an @entity45 immigrant named @entity46 , and he remembered me ( or , rather , my crew - cut hair )
he had n't seen my name card under a flap on the backside of the bag and was planning in the morning to ask the @entity38 to help track me down
i called him -- he was working at his second job
we arranged for him to drop the bag off the next morning
when i thanked @entity37 for navigating the system so relentlessly , she insisted she was just doing her job
when i thanked @entity46 for his help , he cheerfully said , " it 's the @entity59 way ! " my happy - ending story offers a few lessons
one is obvious : always , always get a receipt
another is that @entity9 , contrary to popular belief and their own callous pose , are essentially nice
but the third , even more deeply contrary to popular belief , is that government is not the enemy
government is not inherently inept
it 's simply us -- and as defective or capable of goodness as we are
today , several weeks into the botched launch of @entity76 's exchanges and several more since the shutdown , the faith of the people in government is weak and weakening further
this trend long predates @entity76 , and its sources are bipartisan
@entity83 who favor more active government have tolerated an ever - more complex and impersonal state , while @entity87 who want to shrink government love to showcase the breakdowns that complexity -- and @entity87 - led underfunding -- can bring
what 's striking , though , is that both sides have learned to see and speak of government the same way -- as a disembodied thing , a mechanism separate from citizens
@entity83 tend to forget and @entity87 like to deny the simple reality that government is nothing more than our best attempt to do certain things together that we ca n't do alone
like ensure that we are all insured against health catastrophes
or keep toxic foods out of our babies ' mouths
or send humans to the moon
or design smart transportation systems on @entity113
when government fails , the proper response is n't fatalism ; it 's activism
the question to ask in the wake of something such as the failure of the healthcare.gov launch is n't why was n't i better served but rather , what could i do to make it better ? to be sure , there are reasons why " government bureaucracy " is n't a phrase usually said in gratitude
three times in my luggage adventure , i was abruptly disconnected from the @entity38 hotline after being on hold a cumulative 45 minutes
after the third time , i felt disillusioned
sitting there in the midst of a vast uncaring city , imagining that my bag had been stolen and its contents dispersed , i felt awakened to the hard cold world
but when i got the call from @entity37 , that cynicism receded -- and so did the victim - story i 'd started to tell myself
though @entity37 was an exceptionally dedicated public employee , she was only part of a web of people -- everyday citizens and workers in government and business -- who 'd come together to solve this particular problem
in the scheme of things , that problem and its resolution were utterly insignificant
but they reminded me that we @entity59 carry an often unspoken privilege -- the privilege of expecting that things should function as promised and that civic institutions should be trustworthy and responsive
this expectation of a working public sphere does n't prevail in other less healthy societies
my immigrant cabbie @entity46 described this willingness to trust , to look out for one another -- to do our part to make complex systems work -- as the @entity59 way
but it 's only the @entity59 way if we make it so
the cardinal rule of citizenship is that society becomes how we behave
if we behave as if the state is there to serve us perfectly or else be eviscerated , we 'll get a society where citizens forget how to serve , help , forgive or collaborate
everyone has some say over whether government does well
finding that voice and claiming that responsibility feels good -- almost as good as finding a lost suitcase
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .
