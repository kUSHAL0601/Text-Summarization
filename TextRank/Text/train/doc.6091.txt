put your dog in a bow tie : weird but cute
dress your cat in a bear costume : odd , but let the kitty dream
push your overweight dog in a stroller : ridiculous , but sweet
give your dog a tattoo covering its entire stomach and pierce its ears with mini barbells : wait ! the @entity12 believes some pet obsessions have gone too far
a bill banning the piercing and tattooing of companion animals , the most common of which are cats and dogs , was unanimously passed in both chambers on wednesday
the bill awaits signing by gov. @entity23
if @entity23 signs the bill , violators face possible fines or imprisonment
the legislation was initially introduced in 2011 when a groomer , @entity30 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , began marketing " gothic kittens " on @entity33
@entity37 assemblywoman @entity36 , who represents @entity38 , introduced the legislation immediately after reading an article about the kittens , said @entity42 , her chief of staff
the kittens were pierced down their entire back , according to @entity42
that practice was brought to the attention of law enforcement by the animal rights group @entity48
the groomer was prosecuted and convicted in @entity32
court documents showed she was sentenced to six months of electronic home monitoring and a period of probation
@entity55 did not return a @entity57 call seeking comment
under the @entity37 bill , tattooing is acceptable as a form of identification for animals or to indicate that a medical procedure has been done , but " not for design purposes
" animal advocates hope people will move to having pets " microchipped " instead
last year , a @entity69 man came under fire for putting tattoos on his two dogs
@entity74 , a tattoo artist , said he put the intricate tattoos on the bellies of his dogs so they could be easily identified if they were lost , @entity57 affiliate @entity73 reported
@entity37 's bill gained momentum in early march , when a @entity81 resident tattooed his pitbull while it was having surgery to have its spleen removed
this was the " catalyst for [ the bill ] to move again , " said @entity42
response from the public and animal rights groups was immediate , said @entity42
" i think people have a natural knee jerk for something like this , " she said
people began to ask the question , " this really happens ? " said @entity42
under the bill , piercing and tattooing of companion animals would only be allowed for medical or identification purposes and must be performed by a licensed veterinarian
while tattooing in the past has been used as a form of identification , @entity48 says it prefers the microchip because it is the most effective
" under no circumstance should an animal be pierced , " said @entity108 , senior vice president of cruelty investigation for @entity48
@entity108 calls the bill a " wonderful thing " even though this " should be common sense , " she says
while many states have animal cruelty statues , this is the only ban she has heard of to legally ban the tattooing and piercing of companion animals
