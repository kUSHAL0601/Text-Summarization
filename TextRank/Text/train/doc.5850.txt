@entity0 -- a team of experts will conduct a 60 - day safety assessment of the @entity6 in the wake of the derailment that killed four people and injured dozens of others , the @entity2 said thursday
known as @entity11 , the action beginning on monday is designed to " exhaustively review @entity6 's compliance with federal regulations , its procedures and practices , and its safety culture , " the @entity2 said in a statement
a " strike force " of technical and human factor experts will examine everything from track , signal and " rolling stock " maintenance , inspection and repair practices to communication between mechanical and transportation departments at maintenance facilities to compliance with federal hours of service regulations , including fatigue management programs , according to the statement
the @entity36 line train was hurtling along at 82 miles an hour , over the speed limit of 30 mph for that section of track , as it approached a sharp bend in the @entity41
the cars tumbled off the track , killing four passengers and leaving dozens more hospitalized
the lead car came to rest inches from water at the intersection of the @entity36 and @entity50 rivers
@entity51 , lawyer for engineer @entity53 , and the engineer 's s union representatives said the train 's hypnotic motion may have caused @entity53 to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed " highway hypnosis
" the engineer told investigators that moments before the derailment he was " going along and i 'm in a daze
i do n't know what happened , " one law enforcement official said
man vs. machine : who should be at the wheel ? @entity73 officials have said that the train had no mechanical problems and that the tracks and signals were in proper working order
" safety is our top priority , and this in - depth investigation will help ensure that @entity6 is doing everything possible to improve its safety record , " @entity80 transportation secretary @entity79 said in a statement
@entity87 , a spokesman for the @entity88 , which operates the railroad , said in a statement : " we have robust safety effort underway , including a @entity92 that is already studying areas that the strike force is curious about
nevertheless , since safety is our number one priority , we 're always happy to work with anyone who has constructive ideas about how to keep @entity6 's customers and employees safe
" the december 1 derailment was the fourth serious accident on the railroad since may
in june , a @entity6 train was sent down a track closed off for construction and fatally struck a foreman
in another incident , a @entity6 train derailed and was struck by a train on an adjacent track
a rail safety expert told @entity1 thursday that the sweeping federal review was routine after a string of serious accidents
after the @entity11 assessment , the @entity2 will issue a report with findings and recommendations , the statement said
the agency will also evaluate the railroad 's compliance with recent emergency order requiring " immediate steps to ensure its train crews do not exceed speed limitations
" the order requires the railroad to " modify its existing signal system to ensure speed limits are obeyed and to provide two qualified railroad employees to operate trains where major speed restrictions are in place until the signal system is updated
