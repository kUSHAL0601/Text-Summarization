-- on sunday , @entity1 will go to the polls to elect a new president three months after the ouster of corrupt former president @entity5
we will be there in @entity1 to observe the elections as members of an @entity11 delegation , witnessing a vote that is an important step not only for the @entity1 people 's struggle for democracy , but for the entire region 's hopes for long - term stability and democratic development
in the lead - up to this critical vote , pro-russian separatists , taking their cues from an increasingly aggressive @entity24 , have attempted to undermine the elections in parts of eastern and southern @entity1 through threats and violence
in @entity30 and @entity31 , separatist leaders announced they will not participate in the presidential elections , while heavily armed militia fighters seize control of election offices and government buildings
@entity38 president @entity39 has publicly called the election " a step in the right direction , " but tens of thousands of @entity38 troops remain near the @entity1 border , @entity38 intelligence forces continue operating in eastern @entity1 and @entity39 has been noncommittal about whether his government will recognize the outcome of the presidential vote
as other countries in the region can attest , @entity38 interference in territorial sovereignty is nothing new
since 1992 , long before @entity39 came to power , @entity38 has occupied parts of @entity55 , and for many years @entity24 fostered a breakaway rebellion on @entity58 soil , which eventually led to war in 2008
shortly before this year 's @entity61 , @entity38 forces used the pretext of security for the games to advance miles farther into @entity58 , pledging to return to the ceasefire lines once the @entity66 had ended
instead , @entity38 's military has fortified its gains in @entity58 and shows no indication of withdrawal
@entity39 understands that successful elections and a new government committed to democratic ideals and anti-corruption will have a ripple effect throughout the region , including @entity38
in a recent interview , @entity58 defense minister @entity77 said , " if they [ @entity1 ] survive this crisis there will be a future for all the countries in the region that border @entity38
" that is why @entity39 has undertaken extraordinary measures to undermine @entity88 's effort to solidify its status as a sovereign , independent , and democratic nation
to deter @entity39 's aggression , the @entity91 must inflict immediate and serious economic consequences on @entity38 's financial , energy , and defense sectors
we must also expand and strengthen sanctions on @entity38 officials who were involved in the illegal annexation of @entity101
and @entity39 must know that additional acts of aggression will be met with even greater costs
the vast majority of @entity1 -- like the citizens of so many countries in the region -- envision their future as a united democracy , free from foreign intervention and intimidation , and integrated with the rest of @entity114
it is critical that @entity117 nations support these aspirations through democratic assistance and economic development programs that support the new @entity1 government as it enacts political and economic reforms to root out corruption , restore the rule of law and promote growth and prosperity for the @entity1 people
the @entity91 and our @entity129 allies must not allow @entity39 to continue to meddle in @entity1 affairs and use the specter of military aggression to undermine the safety and liberty of millions of people seeking democracy in the region
it is our responsibility to stand with the @entity1 people and their aspiration to live in a free and democratic society without fear of repression
join us on @entity146 / @entity145 .
