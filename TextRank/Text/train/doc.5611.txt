@entity0 -- @entity2 announced tuesday the new retirement homes for the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program 's test vehicle
the space shuttle @entity8 will be displayed at the @entity9 in @entity10 ; the @entity11 , at the @entity12 in @entity0 ; the @entity13 , at the @entity14 's @entity16 @entity15 in @entity17 ; and the test shuttle , @entity20 , at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity2 administrator @entity18 said during a ceremony at the @entity24
the announcement was made on the 30th anniversary of the space shuttle program 's first flight , made by the subsequently ill - fated @entity30 orbiter , and the 50th anniversary of @entity33 cosmonaut @entity32 becoming the first human in space
more than 20 locations around the country sought one of the orbiters because of the potential tourist draw
the drama mirrored the bidding to host an @entity43
supporters of sites that were rejected expressed disappointment
@entity49 sen. @entity48 , @entity50 , said the @entity51 in @entity52 should have been one of the retirement homes for an orbiter , " but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet , " he said in a statement
he noted that @entity52 " played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle
" " like many @entity67 , i am disappointed with @entity2 's decision to slight the @entity51 as a permanent home for one of the space shuttle orbiters , " @entity48 said
" there is no question @entity52 should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters -- even administrator @entity77 stated as much
today 's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at @entity51 , the greater @entity52 community and the state of @entity83 , and i 'm deeply disappointed with the administration 's misguided decision , " @entity48 said
in @entity0 , shortly after @entity2 's announcement , @entity12 president @entity86 told reporters that the @entity11 would boost the center 's annual 1.4 million visitors to about 2 million people a year
the center plans to use the orbiter as the centerpiece to a new air and space gallery , which would cost $ 200 million and is part of the center 's 25 - year master plan , @entity86 said
that price tag includes the $ 28.8 million that the center must pay @entity2 to prepare and relocate the orbiter to @entity0 , he said
the center has n't hired an architect yet to design the new facility and is now planning a fundraiser , he said
" obviously , we were thrilled
we got the word this morning , shortly before the announcement , " @entity86 said of his reaction to winning one of the shuttles
" the fact that the shuttle was created here in @entity115 had a lot to do with giving us a leg up " over the competition , @entity86 said
" it 's a fitting place for this national treasure
" the center , which also features a @entity0 charter school , is the most attended museum in southern @entity115 and one of the most attended in the country , @entity86 said
the @entity0 center 's existing air and space gallery is now home to the @entity132 capsule that carried @entity133 , a chimpanzee , on a suborbital flight , and the @entity137 capsule flown by astronauts @entity138 and @entity140 on an orbital flight
@entity49 sen. @entity142 said she and sen. @entity143 -- both @entity115 @entity144 -- wrote to @entity2 's @entity77 last year asking that @entity115 become home to one of the shuttles because the state has a long history with the shuttle program
beginning in 1972 , all five space shuttle orbiters were fabricated in @entity152 , @entity115 , and assembled in @entity153 , @entity115 , @entity142 said in a statement
all of the space shuttles were tested at @entity156 just outside of @entity153 , where 53 of @entity2 's 133 shuttle missions landed , she said
the @entity11 will take its final flight on april 29 , and prior to this launch , it will have been used on 24 missions , orbited the earth 4,429 times and traveled 103,149,636 miles , @entity142 said
" @entity115 has a long history of supporting the shuttle program and we are proud to welcome this inspiring symbol of @entity49 scientific achievement and ingenuity to the @entity171 , " @entity142 said in a statement
audience members at the @entity9 cheered when @entity77 announced the @entity8 would be assigned to that launch facility
many people in the gallery were center workers , some of whom are likely to lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends
because the announcement was being made at @entity182 , expectations were high that the visitor center would be awarded one of the shuttles
the @entity8 will fly the last planned shuttle mission in june , @entity2 said
the @entity187 in @entity188 also wanted one
in fact , one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed was already erected in anticipation
prior to tuesday 's announcement , the museum 's president , @entity195 , said museum officials did n't have any inside information
" i think that confident may be too strong a word
i think that hopeful is probably a better one , " he said
but on tuesday , @entity204 gov. @entity203 also said she was disappointed that the @entity2 did n't select the @entity188 museum for one of the retired shuttles
" @entity187 put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the @entity212
as the home of modern day air travel and the 747 , which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years , @entity188 would have been a perfect fit , " @entity203 said in a statement
" however , the full fuselage trainer , that every astronaut including @entity220 has been trained on , will soon call the @entity187 home , " the governor said
" the largest of the trainers , this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands - on training that astronauts get
visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum
" @entity237 in @entity238 , @entity22 , @entity239 , @entity240 , and @entity241 , @entity242 , also put in requests for an orbiter , with hopes that such a historic artifact would inspire countless children in those areas to explore careers in science and engineering
becoming home to an orbiter promises to be a boon for a community
the @entity9 estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year
the economic impact to the area is estimated at about $ 15 million
at @entity22 's @entity21 , executive director @entity260 told @entity1 , " figure over 300,000 people additional ( due ) to the @entity21 , to @entity22
couple that with $ 106 million in economic benefit
we think that 's a pretty good deal
" each winning location has to fork over $ 28.8 million to @entity2 for delivery of the vehicles
they also must guarantee a climate - controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle
that 's still a bargain , officials at the bidding locations said , because of the return on investment they expect
one of the orbiters -- @entity13 , the oldest -- was largely regarded as being @entity14 - bound
that was confirmed by tuesday 's announcement
the @entity20 , a test shuttle that never flew in space , is there now
it was be reassigned , at a discounted price , to one of the locations that did n't get either @entity11 or @entity8
that location turned out to be the @entity21 in @entity22
only two more shuttle flights are scheduled : @entity11 on april 29 and @entity8 on june 28 , wrapping up a program in which the vehicles launched satellites , built a space station , and launched and repaired an orbiting telescope
after that , they become museum pieces
two other shuttles were destroyed in flight accidents
the @entity301 exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on january 28 , 1986 , and the @entity30 disintegrated during re-entry on february 1 , 2003
@entity1 's @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .
