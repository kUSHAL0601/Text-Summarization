-- a controversial policy that limits the amount of time @entity6 troops can hold @entity8 detainees is under review by @entity11 officials , a spokesman for the department told @entity0
the review of what 's known as the " 96 - hour rule " is under way as @entity0 questioned whether the policy was putting soldiers in danger
under the rule , @entity6 troops have 96 hours to either turn over detainees to @entity8 authorities or release them -- a rule put in effect to avoid @entity25 - like offenses
" we are currently reviewing the 96 - hour rule , but have yet to make decisions about how we wish to proceed in light of some of the obvious problems associated with it , " @entity26 , deputy assistant secretary of defense , told @entity0 in a statement
" as soon as we have something concrete to say about our way ahead with respect to this aspect of detainee operations , we will of course share it with the @entity8 government , our allies in the fight and , of course , the public at large
" @entity6 forces fighting in @entity8 have operated under the 96 - hour rule since december 2005
but soldiers interviewed by @entity0 said it could put them in danger because it forces them to release detainees in a short time span
the rule , contained in a directive outlining @entity54 detention policies , resulted from consultations with @entity58 military and @entity8 commanders , said @entity59 , spokesman for @entity6
@entity0 's @entity60 's blog : at the 96th hour " we have to balance the requirement for protecting our soldiers with the reality that @entity8 is a sovereign country , that there must be limits on the time we can detain @entity8 before handing them over to @entity8 authorities , " @entity59 said
" the @entity8 authorities can also talk with detainees to extract information
it is not as though the interrogation needs to end when we hand them over to the @entity8 authorities
" gen. @entity74 , the commander of @entity75 , however , said he was not convinced that 96 hours was enough time -- particularly for high - value targets
" ninety - six hours is not enough if you are going to ensure that they stay behind bars , obviously , " he told @entity0 after a question and answer session in @entity80
" again , there has to be a process by which the individuals that need to be detained are detained , or that if they 're handed off to @entity8 officials that there 's confidence in the system working
" @entity92 announced the rule in december 2005
at @entity0 's request , @entity6 compiled statistics on what has happened to detainees since the agency began keeping such records in 2006
under the 96 - hour rule , about one in four detainees has been released
@entity58 sen. @entity102 , @entity104 - @entity103 , who was in @entity8 last year and who is a colonel in the @entity106 , said the rule puts soldiers in danger
" the one story i hear told over and over and over again [ is ] ' senator @entity102 , this policy makes no sense
it is putting our folks at risk for no higher purpose
it needs to change , ' " @entity102 said
" so the level of frustration is now turning to anger , and quite frankly , here 's what 's going to start happening -- we 're going to take less prisoners
they 're going to start shooting these folks
" @entity102 said he is not satisfied about how the rule was first implemented
" i 've been asking for months now , ' who the hell made this rule up ? why did you pick 96 hours versus 80 hours or a hundred hours ? what 's the source document ? what analysis went into whether or not this is an effective tool to deal with problems that we have in @entity8 ? ' " he said
" i ca n't get anyone to tell me how this thing was formed , whose idea it was and how it became policy
" the case of @entity143 , a former @entity144 captain who received a general discharge for his role in the questioning of 12 detainees , prompted @entity0 's investigation of the 96 - hour rule
those 12 men had worked on his base in @entity8 , including one who was his trusted interpreter
@entity143 was the commander in charge of the @entity155 in eastern @entity8 for much of 2008
he said he feared the enemy was tracking his every move and suspected an inside threat
" out of a 90 - man company , we had 30 wounded , to include two killed in action , " he said
he told @entity0 that his headquarters sent a team to the base to detect possible spies
the team screened cell phone activity to find out which @entity8 civilians working on the base might be working for the @entity170
" it turned out that it was n't just one or two or three , but we actually had a full dozen , " @entity143 said
@entity143 's trusted interpreter was one of them
angry and frustrated that the interpreter might be sabotaging missions , @entity143 detained all 12 men in a small building on the base
when he took the men in the building , the 96 - hour countdown began
the rule is designed to give the @entity8 government control over detainees and avoid abuses like what happened at the @entity190 prison @entity25 in @entity191
but @entity143 said the rule does not work , and many times dangerous suspects are released because there 's not enough time to gather evidence
the other problem , he said , was that the evidence against the 12 men was too sensitive to hand over to the @entity8
@entity143 was ordered not to share classified intelligence with the @entity8 for fear it could be used against @entity58 soldiers in future battles
" so we 're in this @entity205 , where they 're saying , ' hey we 'll take these guys off your hands , but give us the evidence , ' " @entity143 said
" and i 'm saying , ' i ca n't do that because there are technologies and techniques utilized that i ca n't sacrifice for this one particular case that will be used again in a fight later on
' ' well , if you ca n't give us the evidence , then we ca n't take these guys off your hands
' so , the clock continues to tick
" as the clock ticked toward the 96 - hour @entity6 deadline , @entity143 made a decision that would cost him his military career
" i decided that i needed to break protocol and interrogate them myself , " he said
" i took three gentlemen outside , sat them down , walked away , and fired my weapon into the ground three times , hoping that the men inside , left to their own imagination , would think that they really needed to talk
" @entity143 walked back inside
" and sure enough , some of the detainees started to talk , " @entity143 said
what the detainees told him was enough to convince the @entity8 to take all 12 men into custody , including @entity143 's interpreter
@entity143 said he felt he had made the correct decision to protect his soldiers , but the @entity144 charged him with detainee abuse , leading to his discharge from the military
and the 12 men ended up being released , despite the confessions , according to @entity144 investigators
no one knows where they are now and what they 're doing .
