@entity0 -- the @entity2 has granted asylum to an @entity5 immigrant , his wife and teenage son after a years - long deportation battle
according to a letter from the @entity2 , @entity10 and @entity11 and their teenage son , @entity12 , were all granted asylum " for an indefinite period
" the letter also said that asylum status for each person may be terminated if the family " no longer has a well founded fear of persecution because of a fundamental change in circumstances
" @entity1 first reported on the @entity11 case last fall
the @entity23 was then threatening to deport the family to @entity25 even after @entity26 promised to testify in a human trafficking case
attorneys for the @entity23 based in @entity29 wanted @entity11 's testimony in a prosecution against fellow @entity5 immigrant @entity32
in exchange for his willingness to testify , @entity11 told @entity1 that prosecutors promised protection for him and his family
they also promised them @entity40 , he said
that offer , @entity11 said , was verbal and never committed to writing
the trial never took place because @entity32 fled to @entity25 after entering a plea of not guilty , according to the @entity47 's office in @entity29
when prosecutors did n't need @entity11 's testimony , they handed him over to immigration officials , who promptly deported him
within a few weeks back in his native @entity25 , @entity11 says , @entity32 tried to kill him
@entity11 says only luck saved him
he was wounded in the attack and eventually returned to the @entity54 , entering illegally through @entity55
he spent seven months in an immigration jail before being allowed to remain in the @entity54 on temporary status
in the intervening years , lawyers for the @entity23 told a succession of courts that @entity11 and his family should be deported , even though they said they feared for their lives
at one point , @entity63 , an attorney for @entity11 , told @entity1 that the deportation proceedings were a " shameful display of how the @entity54 government will use people who they need to keep us safe and then cavalierly discard them when they are no longer of use to them
" " we are extremely happy for the @entity11 family , " @entity63 said in a statement
" all along , they have wanted to live the @entity54 dream legally and safely
" when asked about the case , a @entity23 spokesman told @entity1 that it was not responsible for asylum decisions although the @entity23 later pointed out that its @entity79 administers the courts that deal with asylum claims from international residents who are in the country illegally , like the @entity84 .
