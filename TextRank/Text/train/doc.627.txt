@entity0 -- it looked like two two - by - fours nailed together
but it had nails sticking out of it , and @entity7 , standing in the parking lot of his @entity11 computer company , thought he should move it
when he picked it up , it exploded
it was february 20 , 1987 , when @entity7 , then 25 , became a member of a dubious club : victims of the so - called " @entity19
" @entity7 's secretary helped police put together a composite sketch of the suspect -- a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator sunglasses -- that was distributed nationwide
but it was nine more years before the @entity19 's 18 - year reign of terror came to an end
@entity19 , now 68 , killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995
he was arrested in 1996 , pleaded guilty in 1998 and is now serving a life term in the federal " supermax " prison in @entity36 , @entity37
on wednesday , a hooded sweatshirt very like the one pictured in the composite drawing , along with several pairs of sunglasses , were among some 60 items belonging to @entity19 offered for online auction by the federal government , with proceeds to benefit some of @entity19 's victims
" his whole life is basically here , " said @entity47 , @entity48 for the @entity49
items offered on the website , gsaauctions.gov , include @entity19 's birth certificate ; school records ; his diplomas from @entity58 -- where he was accepted at 16 -- along with his diplomas for his master 's and doctorate degrees from the @entity62 ; letters to and from him ; and original handwritten and typewritten copies of @entity19 's manifesto , which ultimately led to his capture
the manifesto is among about 20,000 pages of documents up for sale
the auction runs through june 2
in the first few hours after bidding began wednesday , the top bid for a handwritten copy of the manifesto was up to more than $ 6,000
@entity7 retains almost crystalline recall of the bombing
" the only thing i do n't remember is flying through the air , " he said
he suffered some 200 shrapnel wounds , including nails through his chin and lips
an ulnar nerve in his left arm was severed , leaving him permanently without feeling in some of his fingers
he recalled spending " a lot of time getting put back together
" his insurance did not cover his medical costs , since they resulted from an act of terrorism
although he received some discounted rates from doctors and hospitals and some help from @entity98 's crime victim reparations law , he estimates he has spent more than $ 100,000 on medical care and counseling
@entity7 is one of four victims seeking restitution ; the others opted not to
the four were awarded $ 15 million
" it was very , very difficult to have some of the conversations that needed to be had over this auction , " he said wednesday
but he plans to take the money and " do something good with it ... if you 're assigned restitution , pay it
" not everyone agrees , however
@entity113 , who co-authored a book on the @entity19 with an @entity116 profiler , said he thinks the auction is a " misguided idea
" " all it can do is help create this cult of notoriety around somebody like @entity19 , who really does n't deserve it , " he said
@entity113 compared the items to @entity126 memorabilia , and said the auction " can only help but glorify ( @entity19 ) and takes the emphasis away from the victims , which is where it belongs
" @entity47 disagreed , saying the auction is a way to provide @entity19 's victims with " more justice " in a world where victims rarely receive support from the justice system
" the glory , if you will , is already there , " he said
" ... that 's part of our societal fabric
everybody wants to watch the train crash
" " i can see where people claim that it 's going to revictimize and stuff , but i do n't believe that , " said @entity7 , now 50 , who lives in @entity148 , @entity149
" the thing that is funny to me , you 're always going to have a piece of the population who has a very strong opinion and they 've never been affected by it
" the auction is the culmination of a court battle
the 9th @entity165 approved the auction plan in 2009 , @entity167 , a @entity168 attorney who represented the four victims in the court proceedings regarding the auctions , said last week
the nearly two - year delay is due to two factors , @entity167 said
first , " the auction plan tries to protect the privacy of not only the named victims , but the other victims , " and @entity19 's writings had to be redacted to delete the victims ' names and the details of their injuries , he said
in addition , @entity19 was furnished with copies of the writings , and filed motions in both the @entity187 and a lower court about them with objections including that he did n't have time to " quality check " the copies , @entity167 said
" we pretty much designed the auction around his objections , " to prevent him from raising any potential @entity197 claims in court , he said
@entity19 has been " cycling through lawyers " throughout the court fight , he said , sometimes firing his appointed attorneys and opting to represent himself
overseeing the items wednesday , retired @entity116 agent @entity202 said , " it does bring back a lot of memories
" @entity202 led the @entity116 task force that arrested @entity19
he vividly recalls approaching the 10 - by - 12 cabin , which lacked running water or indoor plumbing , with a search warrant
it took agents two weeks to remove all of @entity19 's possessions -- a search interrupted when a live bomb , ready for mailing , was found under his bed
the cabin has since been rebuilt and is in the @entity220 in @entity221
@entity202 remembered how the cabin smelled -- a mixture of dirt and smoke
" he was n't exactly the greatest housekeeper , " he said of @entity19
and he recalled the emotional moment when he and other agents realized that after a search spanning nearly two decades , the hunt for the @entity19 might be over
" we just literally walked in on the mind of a serial bomber , " he said
the @entity116 gave the suspect the moniker " @entity19 " because of his early targets -- universities and airlines
by all accounts brilliant , @entity19 used creative techniques to avoid detection , @entity202 said , even picking up hair samples from the floor of a bus station bathroom to place in his bombs , so dna testing would lead authorities elsewhere
he began his bombing campaign , authorities said , because he was angered that the wilderness surrounding his cabin was being destroyed by development
but items offered in the auction also show another side of @entity19
" thank you for your letter offering condolences , " says one letter to him , dated november 1990
" i was very touched by it
it was easy to be nice to you as you were a delightful , lovable little boy
" personal photographs are also for sale , along with other items of clothing , books with titles like " @entity270 " and " @entity271 " -- and even a record of @entity19 's attempt to seek help
" i am writing you in regard to your request for services , " says a may 1988 letter from a @entity277 mental health center
" at this point in time we do not have any female therapists available
" if @entity19 wanted a male therapist , the letter says , the next available appointment would be " some time in july " -- more than a month away
the 35,000 - word manifesto itself led to a break in the investigation , according to the @entity116
the essay claimed to explain the bomber 's motives and railed against modern society
the task force recommended it be published , in hopes it would lead to the bomber 's identity
after it appeared in the @entity301 and the @entity302 , authorities were contacted by @entity303 , the @entity116 said , who provided letters and documents written by his brother
" our linguistic analysis determined that the author of those papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same , " authorities said
the documents provided the basis for the search warrant for @entity19 's cabin
the irony of using the very technology @entity19 railed against to sell his possessions is not lost on authorities
" my first thought was , ' mr. @entity19 's going to be livid , ' " @entity47 said
the only items not included in the auction are bomb - making materials and any diagrams of bombs , officials said
@entity7 said he does n't agree with the sale of letters to and from relatives , believing they should be returned to @entity19 's family
" to me , that 's crossing a line , " he said
" the family member was not involved in the crime at all
" one of @entity19 's victims , medical geneticist dr. @entity340 , died in february
@entity341 was injured in 1993 when a bomb exploded in a piece of mail he opened at his home
the blast destroyed his eardrums and he lost parts of three fingers
@entity341 told @entity1 in 2009 he regarded @entity303 as " the essence of evil
" @entity7 does n't share that view
he struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder , he said , and spent years wondering who could have done such a thing
eventually , he said , he decided " i 've got to forgive this guy
he may never be caught
i 'm dealing with a ghost
" " there 's no such thing as closure , " he said
" there 's just a different way of living life
" @entity1 's @entity365 and @entity366 contributed to this report .
