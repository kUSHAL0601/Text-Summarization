-- a @entity2 woman was killed in the state 's flash flooding thursday as inclement weather hammers several states in what forecasters predict will be a particularly nasty storm season
as rescue teams were performing 18 " swift water rescues " in @entity15 , @entity2 , thursday morning , the woman -- thought to be in her 60s -- was driving over a bridge when she was caught up in " rapidly rising waters , " said @entity18 , the county 's emergency management director
it was the second weather - related death in the state this week
@entity24 , 4 , died monday after 6 inches of rain fell on @entity26 , about 140 miles southwest of @entity27
the boy was found in a vehicle swept up in the floodwaters that caught the community along @entity32 off guard , said @entity35 spokesman sgt. @entity34
his mother , @entity36 , 23 , of @entity37 is missing , and authorities and volunteers are using canine units in their search for her
back in @entity15 , @entity18 said he was hopeful the @entity42 , which runs through this county located on the @entity45 state line , about 80 miles southwest of @entity46 , @entity2 , would crest late thursday night
south of the capital , @entity49 , @entity50 was shut down because of high water
it 's since been reopened
forecasters warn that areas along the @entity55 could see record water levels , and widespread flooding is expected to continue in @entity2 and @entity58 into the weekend
@entity2 has witnessed widespread flash flooding as parts of 12 @entity62 and eastern states experienced some sort of flood watch or warning thursday
@entity65 , @entity66 , was one of the hardest hit , as parts of the city saw as many as 8 inches of rain overnight and in the morning
another 1 to 3 inches were expected thursday afternoon and evening , according to forecasters
a flash flood emergency had been issued for much of the city earlier thursday , and a flash flood warning remains in place until the afternoon
@entity77 also is under a flash flood warning until thursday evening , and flooding is possible across much of @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82
the weather struck as the @entity84 revised its preseason hurricane forecast to say there is a 70 % chance of an " above - normal " @entity89 hurricane season
where a normal season might bring six hurricanes , three of them above @entity95 or higher , this season could bring as many nine hurricanes , and five of them could be major , the @entity84 says
the @entity84 says the season , which runs through november , could yield as many as 19 named storms
@entity0 's @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .
