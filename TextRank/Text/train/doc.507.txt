-- @entity1 will take a 1 - 0 lead over @entity3 into the second leg of their @entity5 last 16 tie after a late winner from substitute @entity8 earned victory on wednesday , when 2010 title winners @entity11 also conceded a last - gasp goal to lose in @entity13
@entity3 , the runners - up two seasons ago and four - time @entity17 champions , will still be hoping to make the final of the continent 's top club competition , which will be held at the @entity23 side 's home @entity24 on may 19
but with only three wins in seven games since @entity29 , and a run of 240 minutes without a goal , @entity26 ' team will need to improve in the home leg on march 13
" we only seem to win when we take the lead in the first half
if we do n't , it turns out like tonight
it 's just not happening for us at the moment , " said goalkeeper @entity37
@entity8 struck in the 86th minute to stun the @entity41 giants , giving the @entity43 side a precious advantage
@entity3 might have been on the score sheet early at the @entity46 , but home goalkeeper @entity47 twice denied @entity48 in a frantic opening
but @entity1 , who had accounted for @entity52 powerhouses @entity51 in the group stages , also went close to a breakthrough

@entity64 continued his excellent night as he kept out a curling shot from @entity66 on the half - hour mark
@entity1 captain @entity68 wasted a good chance just after the break when he headed straight at @entity71 , but it was @entity3 who gained the upper hand and appeared to be headed for at least a draw
then with four minutes left , @entity77 striker @entity76 picked out @entity8 , who had been left clear by poor @entity3 defending , and he shot underneath @entity37
@entity78 giants @entity11 must have also thought they were heading for a goalless draw at the @entity80 until @entity82 's @entity81 popped up to head home for @entity13 in the 93rd minute
it was the seventh game without a win for the @entity86 under @entity87 , who was left to rue his side 's luck
" we played a good match , in which we created more chances than them , and we did n't deserve to leave beaten , " the @entity11 manager told the match broadcaster .
