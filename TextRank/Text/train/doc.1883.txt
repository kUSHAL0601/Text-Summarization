-- @entity2 manager @entity1 has defended his side 's decision to wear t - shirts in support of teammate @entity7 , despite the striker being found guilty of using racist language by the @entity10
@entity7 was banned for eight matches this week after the @entity10 deemed he had used insulting words to @entity14 defender @entity13 , which referenced the color of the @entity18 's skin
however , @entity7 denies any wrongdoing and , prior to wednesday 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity22 , his @entity2 teammates backed the @entity24 international by wearing t - shirts bearing his name
footballers are tv stars , and should act like it ... this action has prompted criticism on some social media sites , with @entity1 using friday 's press conference for monday 's match against his former club @entity34 to defend his players ' actions
" i do n't think the players have caused any trouble with the @entity10 by their t - shirts
if we are not in any trouble we will leave it at that before we do get in any trouble
" @entity1 added : " @entity7 has been quite emotional and very grateful for the support
" i do n't think it is ever a disappointment when the people you work for give you their undivided support and i think that is the least he deserves
" the club are still to decide on a possible appeal against @entity7 's ban , with @entity1 continuing : " most of the people have had their say , we 've had our say but we will wait for the judgment and take it from there
" meanwhile , former @entity14 and @entity63 defender @entity62 has criticized @entity64 for wearing the t - shirt
@entity64 is the only black player in @entity2 's first team squad and @entity62 , speaking on radio station @entity67 , said : " if i was in @entity64 's situation , i 'd have thrown the shirt to the floor
" if that had been someone in my era , and i 'd heard the comments , then i would not wear a t - shirt with his name on it , saying all is well and good here
" however , @entity79 full - back @entity64 hit back at @entity62 on his @entity81 site , saying : " i will support who i want when i want ! ! ! there are a lot of reasons why i 'm standing by @entity7 ! ! ! "
