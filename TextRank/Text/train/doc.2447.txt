-- cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the leading cause of death among @entity5 in the @entity6 , according to an @entity8 report released monday
every three years since 2000 , scientists at the cancer society have published @entity8 for @entity5 / @entity11
such studies provide data that help develop an efficient science - based cancer control plan
@entity5 are the fastest growing demographic group in the @entity6
approximately 16.3 % of @entity6 's population ( 50.5 million out of 310 million people ) is @entity18
it is estimated that 112,800 people of @entity18 ethnicity will be diagnosed with cancer and 33,200 will die of the disease in 2012
the finding is due in part to the younger age distribution of @entity5
approximately one in 10 hispanics is age 55 or over , compared to one in three non-hispanics
among non-hispanic whites and african - americans , heart disease remains the leading cause of death , according to monday 's @entity8 report , the fifth
while cancer is the most common cause of death for all three populations under the age of 85 , there are fewer hispanics in the @entity6 over the age of 85 , where heart disease is predominant
overall cancer incidence and mortality rates are lower in @entity5 than in the @entity50 @entity6 population , meaning @entity5 have a lower risk of cancer diagnosis and death
@entity5 do have higher diagnosis and death rates from cancers of the stomach , liver , cervix and gallbladder
there are a number of @entity18 subpopulations , each with a different ethnicity and culture
a weakness in the study of @entity18 cancer rates is the fact that much of the available @entity6 data is an aggregate , masking important differences between @entity18 subpopulations according to country of origin
as better data for subpopulations are available , more efficient targeted prevention efforts might be possible
for example , it is known that @entity79 in the @entity6 tend to have lower cancer rates than @entity81
on the other hand , @entity82 in @entity6 tend to have higher cancer rates than @entity81
this is heavily driven by the fact that @entity82 and @entity81 have higher smoking rates than @entity79
' @entity89 ' co-star @entity88 dies at 69 intensive culturally sensitive anti-smoking efforts in @entity93 and @entity92 communities could have a substantial impact
it is estimated that 63 % of @entity5 in the @entity6 are @entity79 , 9.2 % are @entity92 , 3.5 % are @entity93 and 2.8 % are @entity96
the cancer death rate in @entity5 has been declining since 2000 , one of the first years in which accurate @entity18 numbers were available
cancer death rates for all @entity6 have been decreasing since 1991
since 2000 , the cancer incidence rate ( risk of cancer diagnosis ) declined by 1.75 % per year among men and 0.3 % per year among women
this compares with declines of 1 % and .02 % among @entity50 men and women , respectively
the cancer mortality rate ( risk of cancer death ) among @entity5 has also declined by 2.3 % per year in men and 1.4 % per year in women
this compares with declines of 1.5 % and 1.3 % among @entity50 men and women , respectively
the research indicates that cancer deaths can be prevented and lives saved among @entity5 if we increase use of proven cancer screening tests ; make the hepatitis b and human papilloma virus ( @entity127 ) vaccine more widely available ; and reduce tobacco use , alcohol consumption and obesity rates
indeed , this message could be life - saving for all @entity6
the triad of poor nutrition , lack of physical activity and obesity is the second leading cause of cancer in the @entity6 , surpassed only by tobacco use
this triad is an especially significant problem among @entity18 women
current data indicate that among @entity5 , 43 % of women and 34 % of men are obese
this compares with 33 % of all women in the @entity6 and 32 % of all men
stress , depression may affect cancer survival
