-- these days , people do n't want to take a vacation from gaming
and it 's changing the way companies like @entity7 are building their $ 900 million floating cities
@entity7 launches its newest ship , the @entity10 , out of @entity11 , @entity12 , this week
on the sister ship to the @entity15 , @entity13 have created interactive experiences that ca n't be played anywhere else -- including @entity7 theme parks
" because technology has become more progressive in the home , it challenges us as @entity20 to design experiences for guests that they ca n't do at home , " said @entity19 , a senior show producer for @entity20
" with the @entity30 , you take a piece of video wall technology , put it on the floor , and you make it an interactive experience that 's very physical in nature
" the @entity30 , which is available on both the @entity38 , is made up of 32 high - definition displays that push 14 million pixels , which is n't something that 's going to be replicated on an @entity42 or @entity43
this massive floor puts arcade games like " @entity46 " to shame and allows up to 32 kids ( 16 adults ) to gather around the edges and interact with the video games that unfold on the screens by using their feet or hands
around the border of these displays are light pad controllers
there are 48 sensors in each controller that detect the location , the motion and the proximity of each player
of course , these games are based on hit @entity7 movies like " tron : @entity67 , " " @entity68 " and " @entity69
" each ship has two of these interactive floors on board in the @entity74 and @entity75 for kids and tweens
" we have magical appearances through our living character program , where stitch from ' @entity68 ' and crush from ' @entity84 ' appear in the spaces on screen and interact and talk live with the kids , " said @entity78 , creative director for @entity79 and @entity80
" it really is an amazing experience for the little ones to see them make a pizza with the @entity30 while stitch talks to them in real - time
" in those same play areas , kids can also interact with @entity98 , which are roughly the size of a foosball table
what separates this video game machine from anything else is that it offers full touch - screen interaction and exclusive games developed by @entity13 based on films like " @entity108 " and " cars
" all of the games have been designed for up to four players
" we 've designed these experiences to empower kids to go in and just do fun stuff , " @entity19 said
with more passengers now accustomed to playing games on @entity118 , including the new " @entity119 , " @entity13 are creating experiences that blend motion sensor technology and storytelling
the @entity10 introduces a @entity124 game as part of the @entity127 catalog of experiences
@entity128 , interactive show producer at @entity20 , headed the team that developed the new @entity124 game , which features original video of @entity133 , @entity134 and the rest of the gang
she said that many members of her team have a game design and software development background and they keep abreast of new technology like @entity142
the @entity127 , which also includes two additional games ( also available on the dream ) featuring @entity145 and his pals , was developed using facial capture technology and motion capture technology similar to @entity142
" a key part of the interactive experience is the detective badge , which has a specific agent number and a special bar code , " explained @entity149
" each person has a unique bar code , so when you go up to a piece of art , it senses the bar code and will know what scene you 're on and what game you 're playing on
depending on what piece of art you 're going to , you 'll see a different scene customized to where you are in the game
" the game , which sends players to all areas of the ship , is actually an additional level of interactivity that enhances @entity175 pieces
guests who stand in front of this art will see animation come to life
there are video games built into the different stations , which require players to turn the badge to manipulate on - screen items like lighting fireworks and tightening pipes with a wrench
the @entity124 game adds a lie detector to the equation , which offers additional interactivity with characters
( the @entity10 is also showing he @entity124 ' new movie in its @entity195
) the @entity10 adds a golf simulator to the mix on @entity199 's @entity198
designed for avid golfers , this video game features 80 authentic courses that are displayed on a giant screen inside an air - conditioned room on one of the upper decks
players choose from real @entity209 golf clubs and swing an actual ball into the screen
" the system uses motion sensors and infrared lines that intertwine with each other , " explained @entity212 , assistant port of interest manager on the @entity10
" the ball goes though this system , and the angles are calculated as it passes from one line to the next , and then the ball enters the video game screen and proceeds into the course
it 's designed so you can do everything from play a full game to just practice putting or go to the driving range
" for younger passengers , the room houses an adjacent simulator
utilizing the same motion sensor and infrared technology , passengers can pick from hockey , football , soccer and baseball and use actual balls to interact with @entity199 and the gang
interactivity is spread throughout the ship , including a new dinner show at @entity246 that allows guests to draw an animated figure and then watch it come to life with classic @entity7 characters
@entity19 said that just as there 's been an influx of passengers who game , there are more imagineers that have grown up playing games
that 's influencing the types of experiences that are being designed for vacationers .
