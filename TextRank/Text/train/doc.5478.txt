a wise man once said , " i 'm not wearing pants today
" mind you , this wise man was me
and he was n't particularly wise
nevertheless , if you 're a long - time reader of this column -- or if you just heard about my recent " produce aisle incident " in the local news -- you know that i do n't particularly care for wearing pants
but , alas , life often requires such things
unless , of course , you enjoy filling your outlook calendar with frequent visits to @entity15 ( i can draw you a map of the ninth floor from memory
) fortunately , however , a couple weeks ago , while wasting time on the @entity19 and avoiding any actual career accomplishments , i stumbled upon a possible compromise : @entity22
they 're just what they sound like
dress pants ... that are actually sweatpants
" betabrand , you had my curiosity
but now you have my attention
" when they finally arrived in the mail , upon first glance , my @entity22 seemed to be the real deal
they looked good and they felt good -- pretty much as advertised
they 're kind of pricy at $ 100 , but i was amazed
@entity37 , founder and ceo of @entity22 , explained to me that these are n't your everyday sweatpants
" we found a @entity43 terry fabric that looks like classic charcoal wool , " he says
" a designer suggested that we make classic dress pants -- but a whole lot more comfortable
" thus , on monday , i literally walked into the office wearing sweatpants
" look at you in your slacks
" that 's what my startled co-worker @entity52 said when he strolled past my cubicle , likely assuming that i either had a job interview or another " workplace decency meeting " on the 9th floor
a little while later , @entity58 stopped by
" you 're all dressed up today
" again with the praise
now , i 'm not sure if this says more about me and the fact that i normally look like a homeless man , or more about the pants , but the fact remains that i was basically wearing what i slept in , yet somehow getting mega compliments
guys do n't normally notice each other 's pants , so clearly we had breached some sort of man dam
and when i started soliciting opinions from ladies in the office , it was the same thing
everyone thought i looked really clean
and less woke - up - in - a - gutter - y. so , the pants work
from both near and far , they look just like regular trousers , what with pockets and belt loops and that second , inside waist button that lets you know you 're bein ' all fancy - like
my only real complaint was that they were a bit warm
i 'm told a lighter pair is being developed for the spring and summer
but i was fine , and at one point in the day , i sat down with a female co-worker to further explore the @entity22 website
you know , a little clothes shopping
what could possibly go wrong ? aaaaaand that 's when we stumbled upon this word : @entity103
apparently , this company also sells something called @entity106 , and this was the adjective used to describe their unique level of fluffiness
" we invented a quantum world of softness , " @entity37 explained
" where a soft - o - meter can measure and compare the suppleness of things like freshly laundered bunnies and the cotton fields of heaven
we simply abide by what the @entity120 tells us
" i have no idea what this means , but on their website there really is a soft - o - meter image to confirm that , yes , these unisex @entity132 pajama pants are softer than " the anus of a silkworm , " yet not quite as soft as " the womb of a marshmallow mermaid
" so , just what kind of retailer is this ? launched in the fall of 2010 , @entity22 is actually a crowdfunding clothing company where all designs start in their online public " @entity142
" " this is where we post sketches and get feedback from customers , " @entity37 says
" the most popular products are turned into prototypes , which our customers then crowdfund into existence
" it takes about two to three months for a new design to go from the funding stage to actually being in stock
" if people fund ' em , we make ' em. " ultimately , their goal is to release new products every day , from ultra-practical bike - to - work attire to reversible smoking jackets to shiny disco outfits
if the people want it , the people get it
so , now i have @entity22 , which are pretty much the next best thing to going sans pants altogether
and they 're safe for the produce aisle
follow @ @entity170 on @entity171 .
