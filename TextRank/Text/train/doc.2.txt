-- the @entity1 operates an air base in @entity3
the keystone of the @entity7 's @entity6 , it keeps essential mat√©riel moving into @entity9 for @entity11 troops , notwithstanding steady disruption on the roads out of @entity14
@entity15 , which insists that @entity3 is in its " sphere of influence " and claims a special right to protect ethnic @entity15 living there , has its own air base only a few miles away from the one used by the @entity1
in theory , both of these installations serve the mutual security interests of @entity3 and its great power allies
in theory , the bases demonstrate shared security interests between @entity15 , the @entity1 and @entity3
today @entity3 faces the most severe crisis of its history -- and the @entity1 and @entity15 should act together to help alleviate it
perhaps as many as 2,000 of @entity3 's citizens have perished in acts of unspeakable terrorist depravity and violence
perhaps a half million have suddenly lost their homes and possessions
@entity3 's government lit an urgent beacon calling on its allies for help
it had fair expectations of getting it
@entity44 , after all , reminded @entity1 that a good neighbor comes rushing when the house next door is on fire -- so how would a neighbor respond if he actually occupies a room in that burning house ? but so far @entity1 and @entity15 have offered little beyond token gestures
when president @entity54 and @entity15 president @entity55 hold their summit this week in @entity58 , the situation in @entity3 will certainly figure on their agenda
will they offer the world leadership in resolving it ? over the last week , acts of horrendous violence occurred in and around the 2,000 - year - old city of @entity66 in southern @entity3
the acts were methodical and clearly well planned
they involved waves of assault by attackers wearing military and police uniforms , operating armored personnel carriers and other military equipment , followed by gangs of young toughs armed with clubs , rifles and knives
video : refugees say @entity3 troops shot at civilians the attackers killed without hesitation or remorse , looted entire neighborhoods , and torched what could not be carted off
because in many cases the attackers appeared to be ethnic @entity3 and the victims ethnic @entity93 , many observers were quick to characterize these events as acts of ethnic violence between groups with a long history of mutual animosity
but scholars with depth in the region warned against these characterizations
" i do n't believe in a narrative of long - simmering ethnic tension , " said @entity105 's @entity104
in an appearance on @entity112 's " @entity111 , " the @entity109 's @entity108 made a similar point , cautioning against the " ethnic tension " narrative and noting that " there 's a really strong political component to this
" @entity118 and @entity108 are correct
there were interethnic clashes in 1990 , in the waning days of the @entity121 , but even then the circumstances were suspicious
the pogroms that began in @entity66 a week ago reflect careful coordination and organization
the major question is : who is behind this ? the interim government in @entity130 lays a charge at the feet of the deposed dictator , @entity133 , who hails from the @entity134 and still has support there
moreover , many of the police and military leaders in this region were appointed by @entity133 and do not appear to be particularly loyal to the new government
the government 's charges are credible , but it 's likely that the initial waves of violence also provided cover for score - settling , and it seems that criminal elements , particularly narcotics traffickers , have exploited the situation with zeal
here are some points on which @entity55 and @entity54 should be able to agree : restraint : at present both @entity93 and @entity3 armed groups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted
rape and crimes involving sexual violence have been a particularly worrying aspect of the troubles
a strong appeal for restraint and respect for the security measures imposed by the @entity3 government should be issued
protecting civilians at risk : at least 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes , according to the @entity173 high commissioner for refugees
in many cases the homes have been incinerated with all their possessions , leaving them nothing to return to
protecting those who have lost their homes and loved ones from further acts of violence must be a top priority
security must be established at their camps ; bedding , sanitary facilities , food and medical care must be arranged urgently
humanitarian security / policing operation : because thousands of people have been traumatized after being attacked by people they greeted as policemen or soldiers , heightening anxiety along an ethnic fault line , outsiders can provide an important measure of confidence
international monitors can patrol with the local police and army , and international security can protect those delivering humanitarian assistance
but further steps may be necessary if the local security arrangements collapse and another plea for foreign troops is issued
an investigation : the best way to avoid a repetition of the events of last week is to make clear that those who committed acts of murder , looting , rape and arson will be identified and punished for what they did
a broad , credible , independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and their origin , led by a person of international prominence with prosecutorial experience and a mandate to establish the facts and lay the foundation for criminal prosecutions of the perpetrators
reconstruction : the devastation in central @entity66 and in numerous villages is reported to be near total
the international community , under @entity1 and @entity15 leadership , should provide generous support to jumpstart the reconstruction process , prioritizing its assistance to those most directly injured by the violence
elections : @entity3 's dictator was toppled by a violent uprising in april
the country still has no democratically elected government
establishing a legitimate elected government is therefore essential to restoring stability
the international community should mobilize observers to help assure that the elections are fair and free
special efforts need to be made to insure that those who lost their homes and property in the violence are able to fully participate in these elections
@entity54 and @entity55 have taken laudable steps to reshape the @entity15 - @entity1 relationship , systematically eliminating points of conflict and developing new points of cooperation
but the crisis in @entity66 invites them to show joint leadership , providing examples for the entire world community about how to address a humanitarian crisis on the territory of an allied state
the lives of hundreds of thousands depend upon it
