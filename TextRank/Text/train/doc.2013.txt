the sometimes violent protests in @entity1 , @entity2 , and the law enforcement response has sparked a debate about what some call the " militarization of police , " after armored vehicles , stun grenades and high - tech weaponry were brought in to calm the violence
some of the equipment may be military surplus that came from the federal government through a program from the @entity18 's @entity17 , which provides military equipment to local police departments across the country
the @entity17 's law enforcement support program was created in 1999
" this is a program legislated by @entity25 which allows the secretary to transfer some excess military property to local law enforcements , " said @entity18 spokesman rear adm. @entity23 on tuesday
@entity23 said since 2007 the @entity29 has received two humvees , one generator , and one cargo trailer
over the same time period , the @entity33 received six pistols , 12 rifles , 15 weapon sites , an explosives disposal robot , three helicopters , seven @entity30 ( two used by @entity29 ) , and two night - vision devices
" it 's still up to local law enforcement to determine how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment , " said @entity23 , but defense secretary @entity53 " has been mindful of the public debate and discussion about this issue and asked his staff this morning about some additional information about this program
" according to @entity23 , @entity54 has received an information paper with more details on the program , but has yet to order a formal review
@entity54 wants a better understanding of the law and regulations governing the transfer program and what parts of that program are the responsibility of the @entity18
the program has been in place for several years with little controversy and attention , but has grabbed the national spotlight with the unrest in @entity1 , where police have used what looks like tactical military gear and vehicles , although it 's not clear what equipment may have actually come from @entity18 inventories
complete coverage on @entity1 shooting and protests @entity18 officials say a key issue for the department is the fact that once the equipment is transferred , the military has no control over how a local agency uses it
many police departments also get funding for military - style equipment from @entity92 and the @entity93 , which operate programs aimed at beefing up police capability in the event of a terrorist attack
president @entity98 called for a review of the program on monday
" i think it 's probably useful for to us review how the funding has gone , how local law enforcement has used grant dollars to make sure that what they are purchasing is stuff that they actually need
because there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we do n't want those lines blurred , that would be contrary to our traditions and i think that there will be some bipartisan interest in reexamining some of those programs
" sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , chairman of the @entity121 , said his committee would " review this program to determine if equipment provided by the @entity18 is being used as intended
