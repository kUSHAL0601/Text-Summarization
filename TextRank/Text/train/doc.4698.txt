" he never asked nor accepted any reward , because he was good and simple and did not think that one did good for a reward
" ( @entity4 , if this is a man ) @entity7 wanted to keep it to himself
how could a man , so famous and so revered , keep it a secret for so long ? " good is something you do , not something you talk about , " @entity7 once explained
" some medals are pinned to your soul , not to your jacket
" he was @entity20 's very own version of @entity21 -- a man whose personality , character and success transcended sport
in the 1930s , @entity7 , a son of @entity27 , was one of the leading cyclists in the world , a man admired by all
he had won three @entity33 titles -- one of the three major @entity36 cycling events -- in addition to his triumph at the @entity39 and was very much the country 's poster boy
and yet for a man who lived in his life in the full glare of the public , a new film , my @entity20 @entity42 reveals a very different side to @entity7 's remarkable life
directed by @entity52 , the film shows how @entity7 was part of a secret @entity20 resistance movement which helped hide the country 's @entity55 during the @entity58 invasion of 1943
using the handlebars on his bike to hide counterfeit identity papers , @entity7 would ride to @entity55 in hiding and deliver their exit visas which allowed them to escape transportation to the death camps -- he is credited with saving the lives of 800 people
" he never talked about what he did during @entity68 , " said @entity52
people loved him , they adored him
@entity20 was so proud of him
" he risked his life to save others and it 's a story which @entity20 is now embracing
" wheels of fortune born in @entity73 in 1914 , @entity7 was a devout @entity74 whose parents were married by the local cardinal , @entity77
it was @entity77 who recruited @entity7 into his secret network at a time where much of @entity20 had been ceded to the @entity81
in 1938 , @entity20 's fascist regime , led by @entity83 , enacted a series of @entity86 laws which prevented @entity55 from working within government or education , banned intermarriage and removed them from positions in the media
while some of the country 's @entity55 fled the country before the outbreak of @entity68 , those who stayed behind remained largely unscathed until the @entity97 began deportations in 1943
it was at this time that @entity77 , working with rabbi @entity100 , created a system which involved convents , monasteries and members of the general public hiding @entity55 in all kinds of ingenious ways
even after @entity100 was arrested by the @entity97 , deported and sent to his death , the secret network continued to operate
using the guise of long - distance training , @entity7 would ride for hundreds of miles delivering documents while the @entity115 secret police simply let him pass given their admiration for the cyclist
whenever he was stopped , he would simply ask that his bike not be touched since the technical set up was arranged to achieve maximum speed
eventually , @entity7 was forced to go into hiding in the town of @entity123 in @entity124 , where he hid the @entity126 family
in the book , @entity130 to valour written by siblings @entity128 and @entity129 , @entity126 recalls how @entity7 's actions helped save his life and the lives of his family
" there is no doubt whatsoever for me that he saved our lives , " said @entity126 , who hid in @entity7 's cellar until the liberation of @entity73 in 1944
" he not only saved our lives but he helped save the lives of hundreds of people
he put his own life and his family 's in danger in order to do so
" in my opinion , he was a hero and he is entitled to be called a hero of the @entity20 people during @entity68 " it was not just the rescued who were grateful to @entity7 , those who were involved in creating the counterfeit papers in @entity155 also took courage from the cyclist 's fearlessness
worked in the counterfeiting business , @entity159 explained how @entity7 's influence gave him courage at a time where the @entity81 began to get suspicious
in the book , road to @entity164 , @entity159 said : " the idea of taking part in an organization that could boast of a champion like @entity7 among its ranks , filled me with such pride that my fear took a back seat
" according to @entity175 , the @entity177 museum in @entity178 , 7,680 out of 44,500 @entity20 @entity55 were killed by the @entity81
while many @entity20 helped defy @entity181 's attempts to cleanse @entity36 of @entity55 , @entity7 's high - profile meant he risked playing a dangerous game
and yet , according to @entity183 , he refused to take any credit for his role in saving @entity55 lives
" he was very modest about it , " she told @entity188
" he held a profound sense that so many had suffered in a much greater capacity than he had
he did n't want to be in the spotlight or diminish the contributions of others
" as a cyclist and competitor , he could be a real loudmouth
he was very proud and very competitive
" but what made him so fascinating , was his other side -- the modesty which he possessed
" " @entity201 " in september 2013 , @entity7 's wartime heroism was honored in @entity203 when he was named as a " @entity204 " by @entity175 -- @entity203 's official memorial to @entity177 victims
while @entity7 rarely spoke of his actions before he passed away in 2000 , his son , @entity207 , attended the ceremony and met survivors , including @entity126 , who had been helped by his father 's actions
it was @entity207 who helped push his father 's war time contribution into the public consciousness following years in secrecy
" when people were telling him ' @entity7 , you 're a hero , ' " he would reply , ' no , no. i want to be remembered for my sporting achievements , ' " @entity220 told reporters upon his visit to @entity203 in 2013
" real heroes are others , those who have suffered in their soul , in their heart , in their spirit , in their mind , for their loved ones
those are the real heroes
i 'm just a cyclist
" my @entity20 @entity42 has already had a profound affect on @entity20 society
its showing at the @entity237 was widely lauded by critics and has helped @entity20 begin to acknowledge its past , according to @entity52
" we were overwhelmed by the response the film got in @entity20 , " added the film 's director , whose @entity55 heritage comes through his father 's side
" i think this topic had not been touched on or thought about since the war
it was a chance for @entity20 to come to terms to get to grips with chapter of history it had n't addressed
" having spent a summer in @entity255 as a 19 - year - old , the story of @entity20 's @entity55 and how ordinary @entity20 managed to defy the @entity81 had always been at the back of @entity52 's mind
while he spent time learning from some of the great @entity20 directors such as @entity263 ( @entity264 ) , @entity265 ( @entity266 ) , and @entity267 ( @entity268 ) , it was a meeting with a @entity270 filmmaker which left a lasting impression
" one day , the professor who ran the course , a @entity270 filmmaker named @entity275 , took me to lunch in a caf√© in the @entity255 ghetto , meters away from a plaque memorializing the roundup of @entity255 's @entity55 in 1943 , " recalled @entity52
" he told me how he had survived the @entity281 as a hidden child , protected first by ordinary people and later , by priests in a monastery , who all risked their lives to help him escape
" i never thought , back in 1975 , that almost 40 years later i would be given the opportunity to tell the story of @entity20 children who were hidden and saved , along with the story of @entity7 and some of the other heroes who risked their lives to do it
" ' @entity294 di k ' while @entity7 's heroics have caught much of the attention , the story of physician @entity296 is equally remarkable
it was by chance that @entity52 , filming in @entity255 during an early shoot , came into contact with @entity296 's son , @entity303
" we heard that a guy wanted to get in touch with us about the film , " recalled @entity52
" so he came and met us for lunch and what he told us was incredible -- absolutely incredible
" dr @entity296 was a @entity310 surgeon who worked in the @entity311 on @entity312 in @entity255
there he hid hundreds of @entity55 after concocting a tale of a " deadly " disease which had engulfed the hospital
" dr @entity296 invented a fake disease to scare the @entity81 off and prevent them from searching the hospital , " said @entity52
" he called it ' @entity320 ' and used it to protect the @entity55 people who he was hiding
" he would say to the @entity81 , ' hey , you guys can come in but you 'll get this disease and it could kill you '
" he saved many people -- but it did n't really hit home until some of those he saved turned up at our screening
" @entity7 remained intent on being remembered for his cycling success -- his second @entity335 in 1948 was remarkable given it came a decade after his first victory
it was only later on in life after meeting @entity100 's daughter that he agreed to speak about his experiences , though he insisted that he would not be recorded
while @entity7 's cycling achievements are remembered each year in an event dedicated to him and fierce rival , @entity344 -- the annual @entity346 race -- his legacy in the wider world lives on
" he hid us in spite of knowing that the @entity97 were killing everybody who was hiding @entity55 , " @entity126 's son , @entity349 , says in @entity52 's film
" he was risking not only his life but also his family
@entity7 saved my life and the life of my family
that 's clear because if he had n't hidden us , we had nowhere to go
