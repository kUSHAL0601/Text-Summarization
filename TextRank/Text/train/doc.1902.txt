-- a high school senior who filed suit against her mother and father for financial support and college tuition has returned to her home in @entity8 , @entity9 , the attorneys for her parents said wednesday
" @entity12 has returned home and reunited with her parents and siblings
her return home is not contingent on any financial and / or other considerations , " said the statement from the law firm @entity17
the lawsuit has not officially been dropped , but @entity22 , who is representing @entity12 's parents , @entity24 and @entity25 , said the family conflict has been resolved
" the bottom line is it 's over , " @entity22 said at a news conference
" it 's ancient history , it 's done
they 've welcomed her back into the house
" @entity35 , 18 , alleged in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their home and that she was unable to support herself financially
the lawsuit asked that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school , pay her current living and transportation expenses , commit to paying her college tuition and reimburse her friend 's parents for legal fees
her parents said she left home because she did n't want to obey their rules
a judge last week denied the teenager 's request for high school tuition and current living expenses from her parents
a date had been set for april on the other issues in the lawsuit
@entity35 , an honor student and cheerleader at @entity58 in @entity59 , said in court documents that she had to leave her parents ' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment
she alleged , among other things , that her mother called her " fat " and " porky " and that her father threatened to beat her
@entity35 was suspended from school for truancy in october , according to court documents filed by her parents ' former attorney , @entity70
her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend , who was also suspended from school
car and phone privileges were also taken away
once she learned of the punishment , @entity35 cut school again and then decided to run away , her father said in court documents
after receiving allegations that @entity12 was being abused , @entity9 's @entity78 and @entity79 interviewed the teen , her parents and her two younger sisters , but they ultimately " determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded , " a letter from @entity87 states
neither @entity12 nor her parents were present at wednesday 's news conference
@entity22 would not comment on what brought the reconciliation or whether @entity12 was still in a relationship with her boyfriend
he asked that the public respect the family 's privacy
" this is a matter that should have been brought into some counselor 's office , not into a courtroom , " @entity22 said
" we just ask that you respect their wishes and give them some chance to resolve it
" @entity0 's requests for comment from @entity109 , the attorney representing the younger @entity35 , were not returned
a request for comment from @entity112 , whose family had been paying @entity12 's legal fees and housing her for the past four months , also was unanswered
in court documents filed in @entity116 wednesday , @entity109 wrote that only a few days ago , @entity12 indicated that she could not go back home
but after speaking with her mother tuesday , she decided to waive the complaint
if @entity12 wishes to dismiss the lawsuit , it should " be done of her own free will and not due to the extreme pressure of her parents and the media , " @entity109 wrote in court documents
@entity35 's case attracted national attention , which @entity22 noted would likely continue to affect @entity12
he said the family is not expected to make a public statement , despite the amicable resolution
" nothing good could have come from this case
this kid is going to be affected long term from the attention , " @entity22 said
fair or outrageous ? teen sues her parents to pay for college @entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .
