sen. @entity1 is now a citizen of the @entity2 -- and the @entity2 only
if you remember , the @entity4 @entity3 was born in @entity6 to an @entity2 mother and a @entity9 father
as such , he was a dual citizen -- an @entity2 because of his mother , and @entity6 because the country , like @entity2 , grants automatic citizenship to anyone born there
no harm in that , except @entity1 is considered a potential candidate for the 2016 @entity3 presidential nomination
and when the news of his dual citizenship surfaced last year , thanks to a @entity25 piece , some began to question his eligibility to become president
( in truth , that was never in jeopardy
most legal experts said @entity1 qualifies as a " natural born citizen , " a requirement for the @entity35 job , as stated in the @entity36
) the newspaper piece came as a revelation to @entity1 as well
" because i was a @entity2 citizen at birth , because i left @entity40 when i was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the @entity2 , and because i have never taken affirmative steps to claim @entity6 citizenship , i assumed that was the end of the matter , " @entity1 said at the time
then he took immediate steps to renounce his @entity6 citizenship
well , that process was formally completed last month , and he received a letter in the mail this week telling him so , the newspaper reported tuesday
" this is to certify that the person named above has formally renounced @entity6 citizenshp and pursuant to the @entity54 will cease to be a citizen on " may 14 , 2014 , the letter read
" it 's official y'all , " tweeted his spokeswoman @entity56
@entity1 wins presidential straw poll at @entity60
