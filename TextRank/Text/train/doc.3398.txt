-- from @entity2 to @entity3 , @entity1 is embracing its charming -- and sometimes cheeky -- past
every era , from the roaring ' 20s to the swinging ' 60s , is represented , with new takes on old - fashioned locales : chip and sweets shops , hidden @entity12 - style hangouts , even ballrooms
the shelves at @entity15 , in @entity3 , are filled with glass jars brimming with @entity18 sweets
but rather than flaunt themselves as fusty @entity22 relics , these new spots are drawing stylish @entity23 who ca n't get enough of the city 's collective nostalgia trip
they 're celebrating inspired design , tastes and bygone lifestyles with zeal
at the forefront of @entity1 's retro renaissance : sugar
behind a shiny strawberry - red façade in @entity3 , @entity18 confectionary is experiencing a resurgence at @entity15 , a sweet 1950s - style candy store named after its sugar - loving owners
glass jars and cut - crystal candy dishes that grandma would love brim with classic and all - but - disappeared " pick and mix " @entity45 candies -- @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48
it 's the kind of place that will even inspire adults on a strict diet to indulge in sweets ( and sweet thoughts ) of yesteryear
@entity0 : see @entity1 's best retro spots over in the trendy , up - and - coming neighborhood of @entity59 , @entity57 is attracting followers with its jewel - like handcrafted chocolates tantalizingly displayed under glass domes on marble counter tops and antique mirrors
and places such as @entity68 's @entity67 are delighting locals and visitors alike with a return to the no - nonsense proper @entity18 teahouse , serving up comforting classics like @entity74 and buttercream cupcakes
@entity76 ( named after the department store that once existed on its site ) is decidedly more adult ; the quirky basement bar in @entity2 is tricked out to feel like grandma 's -- complete with signature floral wallpaper and consciously stodgy décor
still , zany accents , like a fireplace full of discarded @entity87 bottles , reflect the underground boîte 's joie de vivre spirit of excess
on @entity12 themed nights , vintage gin cocktails arrive hidden in teapots , as @entity94 sets the mood
@entity97 , in @entity96 , is the ideal spot to start -- or end -- an evening on the town , @entity1 - style
now a shadow of its former 1939 no - frills self , the newly renovated fish and chips shop is giving a lighter gourmet twist to an old @entity1 standby ; golden , delicately fried cod and haddock is the restaurant 's main event , supported by more elegant briny treats like raw oysters and classic shrimp cocktail
no matter where you go in @entity1 these days , vintage style is everywhere
what 's old is new -- again ! -- in @entity45 's retro - mad city
