for more than four decades it has ranked among the largest , most useful planes in the @entity3 's arsenal , but a @entity4 has never been retired to any museum
that 's about to change
the behemoth nicknamed @entity8 arrived at @entity9 in @entity10 wednesday , where it soon will be handed over to the @entity12
the giant jet with 90014 painted on its tail made history in 1974 when it became the only aircraft ever to drop and ignite a live , @entity18 intercontinental ballistic missile
yep , that 's correct -- it launched the @entity22 weapon that was designed to wreak unspeakable nuclear annihilation
of course , this particular missile was unarmed
if it seems odd that a plane would unleash a gigantic hammer like a @entity18 -- well , it is
these missiles were n't supposed to launch from airplanes
they were supposed to blast off from underground silos
" it was radical , " said nuclear weapons expert @entity32 of the @entity34
" it broke with anything that had been done with ballistic missiles before -- or since
" the idea of launching @entity40 via airplanes was an attempt to protect @entity44 missiles from being destroyed by enemy missiles , @entity32 said , because the @entity46 would have had a hard time targeting @entity40 traveling aboard airplanes like the @entity4
with three stages , the @entity18 measured 56 feet and weighed 86,000 pounds
never before had the @entity4 -- one of the biggest planes in the world -- ever dropped such a heavy load
related : stalking the world 's biggest planes on october 24 , 1974 , at @entity57 's @entity56 , airmen and crew from manufacturers @entity60 and @entity61 , boarded @entity8
among them , chief master sgt. @entity63 , who watched the whole thing from the @entity4 's cargo hold -- the best seat in the house
" there was inherent danger in it , " said @entity63 , describing the mission
the @entity18 was attached to a special cradle designed to be released on a track leading out the plane 's rear cargo exit
parachutes would drag the missile out of the plane and then point it upward
a timer , @entity63 said , would spark the rocket 's fiery engines
if the @entity18 exited the plane incorrectly it could dangerously push the @entity4 's nose upward , making it difficult to control
another risk : the missile could accidentally become wedged in the aircraft 's infrastructure , shifting the plane 's center of gravity and -- in a worst - case scenario -- trigger a crash
as the @entity4 reached its test range off @entity98 about 20,000 feet over the @entity99 , its four powerful jet engines were singing their signature whine
with the drop zone only eight minutes away , the huge rear cargo door opened , exposing @entity63 and his crew mate , technical sgt. @entity103 , to the roaring wind
soon it was go time
the missile and its cradle were released
parachutes dragged the 43 - ton payload along its track down the 121 - foot cargo hold until it toppled off into oblivion
@entity103 felt the giant plane begin to tip. " you did come off the floor a bit , " he told the @entity115 's " @entity116 " magazine
" it was like dumping a wheelbarrow full of water
" the chutes tilted the missile vertical as it fell thousands of feet and disappeared into the clouds underneath
for a minute @entity63 thought something was wrong
suddenly from below , @entity63 saw plumes of smoke and flame
" it came blasting through the clouds and you got a good view of it , " @entity63 said
it rocketed to 30,000 feet -- 10,000 feet above the @entity4 , as @entity63 remembers it
" it looked like a missile launch from @entity141 , " he said
it burned for about 25 seconds , he recalled , and then " cascaded into the @entity99
" " everything worked as advertised , " he said
" @entity145 has @entity147 film of the test although the mid-air missile launch worked , the @entity3 never adopted the concept
skeptics likely would have seen the project as " a little crazy , " @entity32 said , because it was technically very risky and would have been operationally very expensive to implement on a wider , more permanent scale
it was a " wild card dream , " he said
at the time , the idea was n't really outside the box , said @entity157 , a nuclear strategy expert , @entity160 analyst and former adviser to president @entity162
pulling a missile out of an aircraft " on a sled with parachutes was far from rocket science , " @entity157 said
but war planners of the era were expected to invent new options to protect the nation 's nuclear weapons arsenal
@entity32 credited the project to a " sort of @entity22 euphoria in those days that spurred people to come up with these sort of ideas
" many wonder if the @entity18 demonstration was simply a stunt intended to show strength at a time when the @entity46 were negotiating with @entity185 over a proposed nuclear arms treaty
it was n't ever officially announced , said @entity188 , an engineer on the project , " but we felt they were trying to use this as a bargaining tool for the @entity194 ( @entity195 ) talks
" retired @entity147 crew chief @entity197 , who helped maintain @entity198 during its @entity9 heyday , wanted to go on that mission
he asked to take part , but was turned down
" i was disappointed , " he recalls
even all these years later , @entity197 says he still wishes he had pressed harder for permission
" i loved that airplane , " said @entity197
as its primary crew chief , @entity197 inspected the aircraft before each flight
he marshaled it to @entity9 's runways and then watched it take off
" for a very short period of time , i was a part of that airplane 's career , " @entity197 says
" and it was a major part of my life
" @entity197 , who has n't seen @entity198 in 30 years , looks forward to the jet 's dedication ceremony , set for this fall
" i 'm going to have some emotions about it , " @entity197 admits
" i know i 'm gon na feel pride
" " it 's going to be like a reunion with an old friend
