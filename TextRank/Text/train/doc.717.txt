@entity0 , @entity1 -- the commander of the @entity5 militia in a @entity1 town that has seen two days of violent clashes shows us a horrifying graphic video that he keeps on his phone
a man colonel @entity12 claims is @entity5 is being burned to death by the @entity15 militia
" this is targeting of @entity5 , " @entity12 tells @entity2
" they want the current ( @entity5 ) president to step down or else they will keep slaughtering our people
" @entity12 spoke to @entity2 in a rare interview as a ceasefire negotiated between rival @entity5 and @entity25 militias brought a brief respite to one town after two days of violent clashes
@entity0 , a six - hour drive north of the capital @entity30 , is important to the situation in the @entity1 because the camps for internally displaced persons ( @entity34 ) here host about 40,000 people , 10 % of the 400,000 @entity36 across the country , according to the @entity38
the @entity38 also says there are about 2.2 million people -- about half the country 's population -- who are under threat
when we are ushered in to meet @entity12 , he is listening to the radio , probably for updates on the intense fighting that has kicked off that day in @entity30
he is friendly and chats at length to @entity2 's @entity51 in @entity52
for the interview he dons his military cap and dark glasses and also lights a cigarette that he occasionally smokes during the interview
around us are about 30 of his men -- carrying guns , grenades and some rpgs
their " uniform " is anything but -- varying in color and design
after the interview we go with the commander and his troops on what they call a patrol of the town -- they go round the town in a pick - up truck filled with some of their heavily armed men
the colonel denies targeting @entity78 and ordering burning of villages
asked about the arrival of @entity83 peacekeepingtroops , he is nonchalant , adding that people need to know the @entity5 rebel militia @entity86 is going nowhere
" we are this country 's government
leave power ? maybe if we are dead , " he says defiantly
on the drive from @entity30 one sees many people walking on the road and lounging outside their homes -- men , women and children
as you continue though , it 's mostly men sitting and standing outside their homes
we are told this is because the women go to fetch food and firewood while the men remain on guard against any possible attack on their homes
about 100 kilometres from @entity0 , the @entity38 convoy in which we are traveling stops and we are told to wear our protective gear
back in the car , we travel past village after village of deserted homes and burnt - out huts
the only sign of life we see are goats and occasionally some pigs
before we start filming in @entity0 , a @entity38 official takes us to the headquarters of the @entity122 militia -- everyone who comes into the town on official business has to first report to them
the @entity86 sees itself as the local administration in the area
after two days of intense fighting between @entity86 and the @entity15 militias , the regional multinational force for @entity134 ( @entity135 ) has been able to negotiate a ceasefire to allow aid agencies to get there and assess the needs of those caught in the crossfire
we manage to film at the only hospital in the area , which is run by @entity144 Â© decins @entity146 we arrive we find a young man receiving first aid for a deep cut on his head -- it is from a machete
beds in the in - patient section are full -- most of the patients there have received surgical treatment for bullet wounds
aid agencies believe the number of sick and wounded could be higher in the surrounding villages but that they are afraid to venture out to seek help
similar stories of hardship can be seen in the @entity34 camps -- the one at the @entity167 hospital hosts about 35,000 people
the people , mostly @entity25 , arrived en masse when the conflict began weeks ago
nearby at the @entity174 school , the @entity34 makeshift camp mushroomed in two days from 2,500 people to about 10,000 people
both camps are running out of everything you can think of -- food , water and medicine
and there is little shelter from the elements
@entity186 , emergency director for the @entity1 at @entity187 , says that both sides need to lay down their weapons now
" the rights of child , women need to be respected and they 're not being respected , " he tells @entity2
" and we ca n't do our work and frankly , little prospect of moving out of this situation unless people especially leaders , people who are armed , people who are responsible for armed men recognize that and begin to take those responsibilities seriously
" forced to choose children @entity204 , an @entity205 aid worker , describes the scale of the tragedy : " any situation really of hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances , i would hope that the international community would be mobilized to provide assistance and the fact that we have n't seen it happen yet , is a tragedy
" basically the entire population is displaced
their health condition is extremely grave
we find 100 % malaria positivity , extra-ordinarily high levels of malnutrition and the key thing is the fear of violence , " @entity204 said
" there was this little three - year - old boy who 'd been abandoned by his mother in front of the house because she 'd picked up the other two children and run into the bush
so try and imagine yourself in that situation -- being so afraid for your life that you had to choose which children to carry with you when you started running
" up to 500 people have been killed in @entity30 already , according to @entity240 , and on december 5 , the @entity241 voted unanimously to grant @entity83 troops chapter 7 powers to directly engage militia to protect civilians against the threat of what the @entity38 fears could become genocide in the car
a day after the @entity83 troops arrived , the hundreds of people who had sought safety in the @entity135 base camp , felt safe enough to return to their homes
outside one @entity257 , people scatter screaming as the unfamiliar boom of a low - flying jet sweeps over them
the horror soon turns to jubilation and shouts of -- the @entity83 ! the @entity83 ! the sonic boom is a sign , they feel that international help has finally come
this mission for @entity83 was always going to be about speed and it took them 14 hours straight driving from the capital @entity30 to make it out into the regions , and to @entity0
@entity2 went out with the @entity83 troops on their first patrol since their arrival in @entity0
initially they were on a reconnaissance mission to get a sense of the situation -- they want to get the scope of the crisis here
there is also a show of force -- they want to show the actors in this conflict that they are now here
all morning , fighter jets scream overhead , to hammer home the reality of the @entity83 presence
heavy tanks and weaponry are also on show
the 100 or so @entity83 troops ( with reinforcements on the way ) hope to both make @entity0 safe and push out to the even more insecure bush past the city limits where 100,000 people have been hiding for the past six months in fear for their lives
there has been a respite in the killings but the challenge will be to build on the slow progress
an official from the multi-national force for @entity134 ( @entity135 ) says @entity86 will no longer be allowed to run the country as local administrators , and instead the police will begin to do that
also the militia group will be restricted to their camps and when they venture out , they will be forced to leave their weapons behind
this rule also applies to the @entity15 militia , which include vigilante groups
if any of the groups defy this order , said the official , they will be forcefully disarmed
eventually , according to the @entity135 official , the plan is to absorb @entity86 into the army
the country 's future stability may depend on how successful that effort is .
