@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 , a singer and guitarist with rock band @entity6 , was forced to pull out of a show in @entity1 on friday after his heart started beating at more than twice the normal level , he said on his web site
@entity4 , pictured here in april , co-founded @entity6 with @entity12 in @entity13 in 1973
the apparent tachycardia happened while the band was rehearsing for a performance at a casino in @entity18 , @entity1 , about 90 miles ( 145 km ) east of @entity0
" my heart spontaneously jumped to 190 plus beats per minute , where it stayed for over an hour necessitating paramedics to start an iv and give me a shot to momentarily stop my heart and get it into a normal pattern , " @entity4 , 55 , wrote on his site www.paulstanley.com
a normal heart rate at rest is about 60 to 80 beats a minute , according to the @entity32
tachycardia , or rapid heart rate , can cause palpitations , shortness of breath , chest pain , dizziness , lightheadedness , fainting or near fainting , the group said on its web site www.americanheart.org
@entity4 said he was advised performing would be risky , and the show went on without him
fellow principal @entity12 told fans the group would play as a trio , and turned the show into a tribute to his ailing bandmate
a call to @entity6 manager @entity54 for an update on @entity4 's condition was not immediately returned late on saturday
@entity4 , born @entity57 , and @entity12 co-founded @entity6 in @entity13 in 1973
adored by fans , despised by critics , the group made a name for itself performing in white face make - up and ghoulish costumes
hits during its heyday included such anthems of teen rebellion as " @entity69 " and " @entity70
" @entity4 released a solo album last year
