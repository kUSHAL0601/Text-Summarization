-- a mixed season for @entity2 is at least ending on a high
@entity2 , the world no. 1 , clinched that position in the year - end rankings for the third time when he crushed @entity7 6 - 2 6 - 2 in yet another lopsided encounter at the @entity9 in @entity10
in doing so friday , the @entity11 became the seventh men 's player to achieve at least a treble , joining @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20
" it 's a great deal of happiness knowing what i 've been through the entire season in order to get to where i am and finish the year as no. 1 , " said @entity2 , who became a dad and got married in 2014 but also lost his first coach , @entity22 , and suffered a wrist injury
" it 's one of the ultimate challenges in this sport
" @entity15 leads the way with six year - end no. 1 men 's finishes and with @entity2 going a perfect 3 - 0 in the round - robin stage this year , he ended @entity16 's slim hopes of tying the @entity39
@entity2 celebrated by taking part in a group hug with his entourage -- which included coaches @entity43 and @entity45 -- at the side of the court
" because @entity20 and @entity16 are so good for so many years , they always make you win at least one or two grand slams if you eventually want to be no. 1 , and of course with consistency , because they 've been so consistent with their results
" i know how difficult it is
it 's why i 'm proud of this achievement
" @entity2 , the two - time defending champion at the year - end championships , was almost assured a spot in the semifinals even before he faced the 2010 @entity64 runner - up -- but he made sure of progressing with an emphatic display
it 's almost as if @entity2 was trying to better the second - ranked @entity16 , who on thursday evening thumped @entity67 6 - 0 6 - 1 in a score no one could have anticipated
friday 's drubbing in @entity70 was a little more predictable , given that @entity2 owned a 16 - 2 record against @entity7 and pummeled his opponent 6 - 0 6 - 2 in the final of the @entity74 in @entity75 in october
his best shot could have been a piercing backhand down the line at 5 - 1 in the second set that brought a smile to the face of @entity43 , his lone coach prior to the arrival of @entity45
in three matches this week , @entity2 has dropped a paltry nine games
and when he forced a forehand error from @entity7 on match point , @entity2 saw his winning streak indoors rise to 30 matches
" he just secured his spot for the no. 1 player in the world -- i think it shows how great he is , " said @entity7
@entity2 will face @entity94 's @entity93 on saturday in a rematch of their @entity96 semifinal
that day marked one of @entity2 's low points in 2014 , as the 27 - year - old fell in four sets to @entity93 when he was the substantial favorite at @entity102
but playing in @entity10 might help @entity2
it was in @entity10 in july that @entity2 earned his lone @entity105 title of 2014 on the grass at @entity64
@entity16 , who finished at 3 - 0 in @entity107 , will meet his fellow @entity108 and @entity110 teammate @entity109 in the last four
@entity109 simply needed to win just three games against the player who beat @entity93 in the @entity96 final , @entity114 , on friday evening to book his place in the semifinals for the second straight year
@entity114 missed the last regular season event , the @entity118 , with an arm injury and says he 's fatigued
his results in @entity10 would back up that claim , but he did salvage pride in the final group match
@entity109 eventually prevailed 6 - 3 4 - 6 6 - 3 over @entity114 , only the second match in 12 group games to go the distance
it was the @entity129 champion 's second victory in @entity70 , but he was soundly beaten in straight sets by @entity2 in his other encounter .
