-- the end of august saw the kickoff of the @entity3 , which overlaps both @entity4 and @entity5
the three kick off the annual film industry frenzy known as awards season
see ? @entity9 does have seasons
like many of my colleagues , i have seen only some of this year 's " @entity16 - worthy " films , so the opinions expressed here are based on a mixture of those i have seen with some early buzz and educated guesses
it 's early in the process , and things will inevitably shake out over the next few months as more films are screened , so there 's no doubt that some of the predictions will change
not only that , but some actors are submitted to the @entity31 for supporting roles when the role appears to be a lead and vice versa , so some might switch categories
you 'll also notice that the headings for various sections within the categories are n't uniform , and that 's because each category has its own sets of rules with accompanying probabilities and politics
complicating things this year are the reworked @entity31 rules on voting for best picture , which , while far too convoluted to repeat here , mean there will be anywhere from five to 10 best picture nominees
not to mention the expense of running campaigns
the cost of holding screenings , making screeners and placing ads in the trades makes it harder for the smaller companies to compete with the big boys
in other words , this is not an exact science
films i have seen are in listed in bold
all names and titles are in alphabetical order within categories
@entity74 " @entity75 " @entity76 is about as genius of an @entity16 marketer as there is
whatever you might say about him ( and some have said plenty ) , the man knows how to get @entity16
if anyone can take a black and white , mostly silent film and turn it into a multiple nominee , it 's @entity76
" @entity75 " is absolutely stunning , a beautiful and magnificent creation on every level
if voters see it , they 'll love it
" @entity93 " @entity94 ( " election , " " @entity96 " ) has created ( along with co-screenwriters @entity97 and @entity99 ) an almost flawless film that showcases both @entity101 and @entity102 ( see below ) as you 've never seen them before
from what i have seen ( and it 's very early days yet ) this is the one to beat
serious contenders include : " the help , " which sort of came out of nowhere and now looks to be a serious candidate , even though it has its detractors , and " the @entity116 , " a very well - acted political thriller that is getting good reviews
it could provide @entity102 's second , third and fourth nominations ( director , supporting actor and screenwriter with @entity123 )
also on that list are " midnight in @entity125 , " " @entity126 " and " @entity127 " ( advance word is that this is a fantastic adaptation of a classic spy novel )
there are also a few high - profile films that have n't been screened for anyone , including " @entity133 , " which has @entity134 , @entity135 and 9/11 , so do n't bet against it ; @entity137 's @entity138 " @entity136 " ; " @entity139 " starring @entity140 ; " @entity141 " from @entity142 ; " @entity143 " starring @entity144 and @entity145 ; and " @entity146 , " in which @entity148 and @entity149 team up again ( " @entity151 " ) with some buzz on @entity153 for best actress
best actor some mortal locks for this category probably include : @entity102 , " @entity93 " : the best he 's ever been
@entity158 , " @entity126 " : ditto , although he was magnificent in " @entity159 , " as well
@entity160 , " @entity75 " : a forgotten craft showcased by an excellent performance
@entity140 in " @entity139 " : likely , but i have n't seen it
@entity165 , " @entity133 " : could be the " out of the blue " nominee
in the " they could be contenders " category , we have @entity144 with " @entity143 " ; @entity170 with " @entity171 " and " @entity172 " ; @entity173 in " 50/50 " ; @entity174 in " @entity116 " ; @entity175 in " @entity127 " ; and @entity176 in " like @entity177
" best actress in the " strong possibility " category , we have : @entity182 , " melancholia " : one of the most amazing performances i have ever seen
read my writeup from @entity5 here
a lot will depend on how much @entity187 is willing to spend on its campaign for her and how much director @entity192 's comments in @entity193 hurt the film
@entity195 , " @entity196 " @entity197 , " @entity198 " : wow
@entity199 , " @entity200 " @entity201 , " @entity202 " a list of " mmmmm , could be " potential nominees includes @entity205 in " @entity172 , " @entity153 in " @entity146 " and @entity206 in " like @entity177
" in the " no one 's seen it , but ... duh " category , we must place @entity210 for her performance as former @entity213 prime minister @entity212 in " @entity214
" best director those leading the pack include : @entity218 , " midnight in @entity125 " @entity219 , " @entity75 " @entity220 , " @entity126 " @entity94 , " @entity93 " @entity221 , " @entity133 " " coming up strong on the outside " is a group that includes @entity223 for " @entity127 " ; @entity102 for " @entity116 " ; @entity225 for " @entity226 " ; and @entity148 for " @entity146
" the ones i would term " masters with unseen films " include @entity228 's " @entity139 " ; @entity231 and " @entity232 " ; @entity137 with " @entity136 " ; and @entity142 with " @entity141
" best supporting actor these next two are really tough to predict right now , with almost everyone holding front - runner status
also , i have n't seen many of the films in the supporting categories , so my guesses are likely to be less educated than usual ! likeliest based on current buzz / past nods : @entity243 , " drive " @entity244 , " @entity200 " @entity245 , " @entity214 " @entity246 , " @entity247 " @entity248 , " @entity133 " the rest of this excellent pack : @entity102 , " the @entity116 " @entity134 , " @entity133 " @entity251 , " @entity127 " @entity252 , " the @entity116 " @entity253 , " @entity172 " @entity254 , " @entity146 " best supporting actress advance buzz favors this quartet : @entity258 , " @entity196 " ( also in " @entity226 " and " @entity259 " ) @entity260 , " @entity261 " @entity262 , " @entity196 " @entity263 , " @entity93 " other contenders include @entity135 in " @entity133 , " @entity265 in " @entity171 " and @entity266 in " carnage
" @entity268 there 's only one that i would place in my " pretty much a guarantee " slot , and that would be @entity218 for " @entity276
" serious contenders include : @entity225 , " @entity226 " @entity278 , " @entity139 " @entity280 and @entity281 , " @entity279 " @entity282 i 'd bet my lunch on nominations for : @entity94 and @entity97 & @entity99 , " @entity93 " @entity286 and @entity287 , " moneyball " @entity288 and @entity289 , " @entity127 " other front - runners include @entity102 , @entity123 and @entity291 for " @entity116 , " @entity292 for " @entity172 " and @entity293 for " @entity133
" i know , i did n't touch on the categories of animation , documentaries , cinematography and many other categories
there 's plenty of time between now and the awards on february 26 , not to mention the @entity305 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity299 , etc. , etc.
