@entity0 -- @entity3 prosecutors are asking a state court to set a november 9 execution date for @entity6 , convicted in a series of sniper - style shootings that terrorized the @entity0 area in 2002
@entity6 was sentenced to death for the slaying of @entity13
in a letter dated wednesday , senior assistant attorney general @entity14 said the november date " has been carefully coordinated with the governor 's office to insure his availability for any clemency petition @entity6 may wish to pursue
" @entity14 enclosed a copy of a proposed execution order " for the court 's convenience
" @entity6 's attorney said he will file an appeal with the @entity27 @entity26 , and will ask the governor for clemency
during a three - week period in october 2002 , police say , @entity6 and his young protege , @entity31 , shot 13 people , killing 10
the two also are suspected in other shootings and murders in @entity35 , @entity0 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and the @entity0 , area
@entity6 , now 48 , was convicted of murder in the death of @entity13 at a @entity42 , @entity3 , filling station
@entity13 was killed by a single bullet , which became the signature of the two - person sniper team
ultimately , @entity6 was convicted of the @entity47 ' killing and of one @entity49 murder , which prosecutors there said was " insurance " in case the @entity3 conviction was overturned
@entity31 was convicted of one @entity3 shooting and was sentenced to life imprisonment
@entity6 's attorney , @entity57 , released the prosecutor 's letter friday
the letter , addressed to the chief judge of the @entity62 , says the court must hold a hearing within 10 days of receiving the letter , and must set an execution date no later than 60 days after the hearing
since @entity6 is not required to be at the hearing , @entity14 asks that the court conduct the hearing by means of a conference call .
