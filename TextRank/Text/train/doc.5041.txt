-- on newspaper racks tuesday , 9/11 was markedly absent from the front pages of the @entity3 and the @entity4
" the pain , the outrage , the loss -- these never fade , " wrote the @entity3 public editor @entity5
" the amount of journalism , however , must
" on the 11th anniversary of a tragedy , some @entity12 arose not remembering
it was another day of making coffee , packing sandwiches for kids ' lunches , dropping off the dry cleaning before work
memorial ceremonies , too , were fewer and simpler than in the past
it is natural for time to heal
natural , too , for people to want to move on
but there was one place where the tragedy was hard to miss -- on social media
honoring a son 's memory after 9/11 @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 did not exist 11 years ago
@entity38 did not transpire in social media real time as many news events today do
but memories of that horrific day were kept alive tuesday via smartphone , tablets and computers
social media was a way for people to express their emotions when there were fewer physical ways to do so , said @entity51 , ceo of @entity52
maybe you were n't going to the local remembrance and hear the bells toll at 8:46 a.m. , the time @entity57 slammed into the @entity58
but you could get out your phone and tweet what you remembered about that moment
" there 's a lot of trending now on @entity34 which shows it 's a lot more durable than the media would believe at this point , " @entity51 said
stars remember 9/11 on social media among trending topics tuesday were @entity70 , @entity38 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75
" if the public comments did not exist , then you would not have the same attention on 9/11 , " said @entity76 , a social media technology expert
" there are so many moments we have let go because in the mental consciousness of our society , sometimes we forget things , " he said
" social media provides the opportunity to find those issues you are concerned about
" the @entity91 memorialized fallen officers through a @entity34 campaign with the hashtag # neverforget
each tweet linked to a poignant @entity35 page about an officer
it was the social media version of a reading of names
some people tweeted about where they were when they first got news about the attacks
@ mikestuchbery : " this time 11 years ago i was working on a presentation for a uni @entity108 course
" @entity35 users posted photos of how @entity112 looked with the @entity70 and how it looked tuesday morning
others posted sayings such as " @entity115 , " and still others , their remembrances of people who perished that day
even politicians took a break from the campaign to offer their remembrances on @entity34
president @entity128 ( @entity129 ) tweeted : " as painful as this day is and always will be , it leaves us with the lesson that no act of terrorism can ever change what we stand for
" his rival , @entity130 ( @ @entity131 ) , posted : " in remembrance , let us recall what the flag symbolizes & the many who have sacrificed so that we may fly it proudly
" politics muted on 9/11 anniversary there were @entity34 and @entity35 gasps at realizing it has already been 11 years and that some young soldiers fighting in @entity143 were in second grade when the @entity70 came crashing down
@entity149 's @entity37 photo was a collage of three images -- a @entity73 skyline with the burning @entity70 , an @entity12 flag tacked to the inside of a transport aircraft in @entity143 and of himself with an @entity143 soldier in front of an @entity143 flag
" it shows we are here to better their country , even when our lives are on the line , " he said
" that job was one of the worst jobs in the world , but we loved every second of it
" @entity170 , who was born two months after the two planes flew into the @entity70 towers , designed a t - shirt commemorating 9/11
his older brother posted a photo of @entity170 's work on @entity37
" throughout his elementary school years he was always informed and educated about 9/11 , " said the older brother , @entity177 @entity170 , he said , wanted to go beyond wearing the red , white and blue colors the school suggested
son 's name missing from 9/11 memorial @entity184 snaps poignant photo at memorial wall @entity187 , a sociology professor at @entity189 's @entity188 , said social media helps @entity12 remember 9/11 in an anniversary year that is not a milestone 10th , 20th or 25th
it also provides ways to remember events other than the structured process of scheduled memorials , said @entity187 , who has studied coverage of 9/11
there was a proscribed way before of how to be solemn
the symbolism went through official channels
" it was an informal process but it was structured , " he said
social media takes all the barriers away
the conversation about 9/11 is also different now on @entity34 and @entity35 , especially after the killing of @entity210 , @entity187 said
" there was only one way to talk about 9/11 and that was tragedy , ' @entity187 said
" but now it 's about core @entity12 values
" @entity219 reporter @entity218 's tweet may have reflected a chunk of how @entity12 were feeling tuesday
but 9/11 was 11 years ago and life does go on
@entity223 : media 's balancing act with terrorism " this day will always serve as a reminder that life can be taken from you at any moment
cherish every minute , " @entity218 tweeted
the next tweet , an hour later , was about tennis sensation @entity234 's @entity233 victory
@entity0 's @entity235 contributed to this report .
