@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity5 intends to meet the @entity6 even though @entity1 has warned that such a meeting would harm bilateral ties , a @entity4 spokesman said tuesday
" the president told @entity1 's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the @entity6 , and he intends to do so , " @entity9 told reporters covering @entity5 's planned town hall meeting in @entity12 later tuesday
no date for @entity5 's meeting with the @entity18 spiritual leader has been announced
the @entity6 has speaking engagements scheduled in the @entity20 in late february and in may
earlier tuesday , @entity1 warned that ties between two of the world 's superpowers would be strained if @entity5 met with the @entity6
" it will seriously undermine the foundation of @entity33 political relations , " said @entity25 , a @entity26 official who is in charge of talks with representatives of the @entity6
" we will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes
" @entity25 issued his warning during a news conference to discuss the lack of progress made during five days of talks between @entity1 and the @entity6 's representatives
@entity0 accuses the @entity6 of advocating for @entity18 independence from @entity1
" the two sides had sharply divided views , " @entity25 said
" we have been accustomed to such clash of viewpoints
it 's been the norm rather than the exception
" in explaining @entity5 's intention to hold the meeting , @entity9 said the @entity6 " is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader , and the president will meet with him in that capacity
" as the president has expressed , we expect that our relationship with @entity1 is mature enough where we can work out issues of mutual concerns -- such as climate , the global economy and nonproliferation -- and discuss frankly and candidly those issues where we disagree , " @entity9 said
" the president is committed to building a positive , comprehensive and cooperative relationship with @entity1
" @entity67 is technically autonomous from the central @entity1 government , but the @entity6 and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of @entity75 , the most numerous ethnic group in @entity1
@entity25 said there would be no compromise on @entity1 's control of @entity67
representatives from the two sides have met eight other times , but have reached no consensus on the issue of autonomy
the @entity6 fled @entity1 in 1959 after a failed uprising against @entity1 rule
he lives in exile in the north @entity89 hill town of @entity90
@entity9 said the @entity20 " considers @entity67 to be a part of @entity1 , and we have human rights concerns about the treatment of @entity18
" " we urge the government of @entity1 to protect the unique cultural and religious traditions of @entity67 , " he said
@entity2 's @entity97 and @entity98 contributed to this report .
