@entity2 debris from a previous crash was to blame for a prison transport bus leaving the interstate and crashing into a moving train earlier this month near @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity0 said thursday
eight inmates and two correctional officers were killed in the crash
according to the @entity0 , the 225 - foot - long metal guardrail leading up to an overpass was damaged in a vehicle collision the day before the prison bus accident
subsequent crashes caused by icy conditions moved portions of the guardrail onto traffic lanes
the bus , westbound in the left lane , apparently struck the guardrail pieces , veered to the left and hit an embankment before becoming airborne
at the base of the embankment , the bus continued toward the railroad tracks below the overpass , striking the 54 - car train
five more people -- four inmates and one staff member -- were injured in the incident and hospitalized
the bus was traveling from a prison facility in @entity35 , @entity9 , to one in @entity36 , @entity9 .
