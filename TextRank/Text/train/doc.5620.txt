@entity0 is widely thought to be one of the most famous panel paintings in the world
stolen several times ( most notoriously during @entity13 by the @entity14 , who hid it in a salt mine ) , the altarpiece , currently housed in @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , depicts among other things a ' @entity19 ' bleeding into a chalice
it has been admired and coveted for centuries
now an ambitious digital documentation project is allowing scholars and art - lovers alike to pore over the minute details of @entity27 and @entity29 's multi-part painting in a specially - designed , open source website entitled ' closer to @entity31 : rediscovering the @entity2
' consisting of 12 panels ( one of which is a copy , the original having been stolen in 1934 ) and depicting numerous complex theological scenes , the documentation project has rendered the already composite work into 100 billion pixels using the highest resolution photography
a collaboration between the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity11 , and the @entity44 , and funded with support from the @entity46 in @entity47 and the @entity48 , the venture to digitally document the work took 9 months , initially to assess it for conservation
" and then it grew into ' these results are interesting , how can we share this information with the widest possible audience on a website ? ' " said @entity53 , director of the @entity46
the documentation process -- which made use of macrophotography in visible light , macrophotography in infrared light , infrared reflectography and @entity66 -- probed beneath the painted surface to reveal the under - drawings
" one of the big open questions surrounding the polyptych is the involvement of @entity29 , the older brother of @entity31 , in the production of the painting , " said @entity69 , professor of @entity70 at @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , who led the project
" we ought to look for @entity29 's hand in the under drawings of the panels , which were revealed with infrared macrophotography , and with infrared reflectography , " he explained
entirely open - source , the website that came out of the documentation process is now live and accessible to art - lovers as well as scholars , allowing users not only to zoom in on tiny details of the work , but also to go beneath the surface of the paint and see how the composition evolved over time
" at the @entity46 , we 've always supported the less sexy things that go on behind the scenes of great public projects -- conservation , research , planning -- things that are really crucial but less visible , " said @entity53
" but recently we 've made a greater effort to take the results of those behind - the - scenes activities and make them more immediately available to a wider public , " she continued
" it 's technically an amazing feat that they were able to do this so precisely and present the images in such a way that you can juxtapose the regular image , as you would normally see it , with the under - drawings , " said @entity110 of the @entity46
while the website has a wide appeal , he said , it will also be an invaluable tool for the next generation of scholars
" the last conservation on the altarpiece took place in the 1950s with a little bit of work done in the ' 80s , and the technology was not as advanced as it was today , " he said
the @entity133 is to undergo a full , five - year - long restoration treatment beginning in september 2012
the panel will be disassembled in three stages , and the parts being restored will be taken to the @entity138 in @entity10 , where the public will be able to view the treatments taking place from behind a pane of glass
@entity69 , who lived with the altarpiece for six months while documenting it , told @entity1 : " the @entity2 has kept many scholars -- and very different types of scholars for that matter -- busy for centuries , and will doubtless continue to do so
" he believes the website will open up a " whole new world " for scholars who have toiled for years either working from color reproductions or from the work itself
still , @entity69 concedes that it is no substitute for seeing the work in person
" what you ca n't show on a website is the sheer monumentality of the altarpiece , the incredible realism of the painting , " he said
" when you are looking eye to eye with the @entity169 ... it 's hard to explain , but i can see why the polyptych still grips so many people , " he said
see the @entity2 up close on the closer to @entity31 website , or visit it in person at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 .
