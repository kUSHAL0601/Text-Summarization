@entity0 , @entity1 -- the return to school after the summer break is an annual milestone in every child 's life
but as the school buses pulled up to take more than 5,000 children back to class in @entity0 , @entity1 , tuesday , it was far from an ordinary day
the returning students were greeted not only by their teachers but also the presence of more armed guards -- and with them a solemn reminder of the tragedy that struck their town last year
@entity21 and @entity22 are among those for whom the back - to - school ritual will be hardest
while their children @entity29 , 11 , and @entity30 , 13 , are returning to class as they have each year , their youngest child , 7 - year - old @entity24 , is not
he was one of 20 young children killed during the horrific shooting spree inside @entity0 's @entity34 last december
six teachers were also killed by @entity36 , 20 , who then took his own life
" this will be our first time back to school without @entity24 , " said his father , @entity21
the family 's pain is still raw -- and it 's hard not to imagine how it would have been to see their boy going off to second grade
" it 's still day to day , and we have better days than others , " his mother said
@entity34 is being torn down and its students will head tuesday to @entity54 instead , the site to which they moved when classes resumed in january
the heightened security they will find there will be replicated in schools across the district
opinion : does your child 's school have a security plan ? armed security the school board is doing everything it can to put families at ease in the wake of last year 's shooting and the recent gun scare in @entity75
steps taken include better locks on doors , real - time monitoring systems and more armed guards at every school
" it 's not a normal back - to - school but we 're trying to put the resources in place to make it as normal as possible , " said @entity82 , who chairs the education board
" parents will definitely see armed security at each school and there will be additional guards at multiple schools
" the number of guards present will depend on the size of the school and number of students , she added
more safety measures are expected to be put in place in @entity0 schools over the course of the school year , but officials did not go into detail
it 's not just @entity0 where the security of children and their educators is at the forefront of people 's minds
school districts across the country are adding more security guards , particularly to their elementary schools
at least three states have also passed laws recently allowing teachers to be able to carry handguns on campus
for the @entity128 , the daily struggle to carry on family life without @entity24 continues
what they 'd like to see are positive changes in the way people act , such as showing more kindness to others , to try to prevent others suffering a similar loss
" we have to try to do the good work that he was supposed to do here , " said @entity21
" we 're gon na try our best to do it for him
" @entity0 residents find their voice
