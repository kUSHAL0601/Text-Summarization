-- apparently , all those clicks over at @entity2 are paying off in more ways than one
for hitting a big traffic goal , all 700 or so employees of the viral news site will be getting free @entity9 smartwatches -- a bonus that will cost at least $ 245,000
early last month , ceo @entity11 sent a memo to his staff celebrating @entity2 surpassing $ 100 million in revenue for the year
" this is a huge milestone and amazing accomplishment ! " he wrote
he also issued a challenge
if the site hit 200 million unique visitors and 750 million video views in november , the entire staff would get one of @entity9 's watches , which are set to hit the market in early 2015
the least expensive model will sell for $ 349
@entity11 told the staff they 'd met the goals at a meeting on thursday , according to @entity30
he later confirmed it on @entity32
. known largely for buzzy , viral posts that have a way of rampaging across social media -- critics would call it clickbait -- @entity2 , founded in 2006 , has made moves over the past couple of years to expand its coverage to politics and other serious news
@entity43 of @entity44 was brought on in 2012 as the site 's editor - in - chief to push the new direction
friday morning , alongside such light fare as " @entity50 's slept with a @entity51 " and a " how hipster are you ? " quiz , @entity2 's main page included coverage of protests spurred by the @entity58 police choking death of @entity60 and a live feed of president @entity63 's announcement of a new secretary of defense .
