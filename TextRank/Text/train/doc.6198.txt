-- we do n't yet know how heavy a blow @entity2 will deliver to the @entity3 when it hits
but mindful of the devastation that @entity9 left in its wake , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , and @entity7 have declared states of emergency and evacuations have begun
public officials and emergency managers are getting good at getting people out of harm 's way
unfortunately , where official plans are likely to fall short is in helping evacuees to quickly return to their storm - damaged communities and get back on their feet
the kind of levee system failure we saw with @entity9 in @entity27 in 2005 is not likely to be repeated with this storm , given the $ 14 billion investment that the @entity29 is close to completing
harder hit will be the people along the @entity7 , @entity6 , and @entity4 coastlines and in low - lying inland areas with no levee protection
but it 's making communities safe enough for residents to return to quickly that is so important , because packing up and running away from the weather is so expensive
the average @entity3 family fleeing the storm will have to dole out and estimated $ 250 to $ 300 a day for food and lodging
with the economy still foundering , and the unemployment rate for most of the @entity3 region still above 8 % , plenty of folks have no savings to pay for shelter or even to fill the gas tank for the drive inland
those who must leave their jobs behind will have smaller paychecks to draw on when the credit card bills arrive at the end of the month
the longer they must stay away , the greater the financial setback they will face
while the media satellite trucks are likely to leave shortly after @entity2 passes , plenty of hardship stories will be left to tell once @entity3 evacuees are allowed to return to their homes
residents will almost certainly face the same kinds of challenges they experienced seven years ago in the aftermath of @entity9
our elected officials all recognize the high political cost of failing to respond to a disaster as it unfolds , and will do whatever it takes to earn good marks
but despite the painful experiences the @entity3 region has endured in the aftermath of recent storms , the path to recovery will still be a rocky one
@entity87 , state and local government officials have not resolved many of the bureaucratic and insurance - related issues that slow restoring services , paying out legitimate claims and making repairs
damage assessments have to be made and questions about liability and coverage have to be resolved for homes and businesses that are destroyed
in public spaces , cash - strapped agencies have to determine who is responsible for clearing debris and cleaning up spills of hazardous materials
to date , too little attention has been paid to streamlining these processes
when government falls short in meeting the immediate needs of victims , nonprofit and faith - based relief organizations often step in to fill the void
but long before @entity2 started churning through the warm waters of the @entity3 , relief organizations throughout the @entity3 were already under severe stress , trying to serve nearly one - fourth of the region 's residents who have a chronic need for assistance
and with charitable giving down below 2007 levels , churches and small community - based organizations have had to cut back on staff and make painful cuts in the social services they provide
what this means is that the ultimate safety net for the neediest populations may be one of the victims of @entity2
these organizations will require early and substantial outside assistance
the storm will provide yet another vivid display of nature 's menacing capacity for destruction and disruption as @entity141 gather in @entity142 , @entity5 , and a few days before @entity143 descend on @entity144 , @entity145
organizers for both national conventions have promised programs that will offer up contrasting views of the role of government
@entity2 will provide a reminder that managing messy real world challenges does not lend itself to simple formulas favored by political partisans
when it comes to assuring the safety and well - being of @entity160 , the truth lies somewhere in the middle
responding to and recovering from disasters require individual and local resilience on the one hand , and capable and competent government at all levels -- local , state , and federal -- on the other
throughout this election season our political parties have been busy highlighting what divides us
but disasters have a way of teaching lessons that should unite us
when catastrophic events happen , it is the decisions and actions of local officials and everyday people that are key to survival
but when it comes to planning evacuations , maintaining levees , and supporting the speedy recovery of communities leveled by a storm -- government matters
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 and @entity196 .
