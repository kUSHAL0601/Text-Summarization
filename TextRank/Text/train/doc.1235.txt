@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands of @entity1 demonstrators urged their leaders monday night to shut down nuclear power plants in their country
the protests were staged in @entity0 and other cities days after a powerful earthquake damaged nuclear plants in @entity11 and spurred fears of radiation there
@entity15 of the @entity16 , an environmental group , said the movement had received a major boost from the crisis in @entity11
@entity15 said more than 100,000 turned up in more than 400 cities
there were hundreds of people at the @entity0 protests and shouts of " turn them off , " a reference to @entity1 nuclear reactors , rang through the demonstration
on saturday , protesters formed a 45 - kilometer human chain between @entity31 and the nuclear power plant @entity33
police said around 60,000 people showed up for the protest , organized by various anti-nuclear organizations
@entity1 chancellor @entity38 has announced a three - month moratorium on the extension of the operation periods for @entity1 nuclear plants
that move will lead to at least one @entity1 nuclear plant shutting down very soon , @entity1 's environmental minister later said in a statement
@entity1 opted out of nuclear energy during the @entity49 administration and the country is waiting for the operational periods of its nuclear plants to expire
but the more pro-nuclear @entity38 government , which succeeded the @entity55 administration , had passed a law extending the lifespan of the plants .
