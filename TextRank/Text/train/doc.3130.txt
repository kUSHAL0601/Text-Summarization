-- one thing 's missing from the official version of what happened to @entity4 , say some experts and family members : hard evidence
@entity9 prime minister @entity8 has said the missing plane 's journey ended in the southern @entity12 , and that the conclusion was based on an analysis of satellite data by a @entity17 company and aviation investigation agency
" we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that @entity4 has been lost and that none of those on board survived , " @entity19 told family members of the missing passengers
the announcement drew howls of grief
but it also provoked skepticism
hundreds of friends and family members of passengers marched to the @entity33 in @entity34 tuesday to express their anger and frustration
they claimed they were n't being told the truth by the @entity9 government about what happened to the plane after it disappeared from radar on march 8
" if you find something : ok , we accept , " said one relative of a passenger
" but nothing -- just from the data , just from analysis
" ' something from the seas ' " i suppose i want to see something from the seas , " said @entity53 , an @entity12 man whose sister @entity54 was on the plane
" i do n't know why i just want to see some debris off the aircraft and the black box to know what exactly happened because there are too many unanswered questions
" @entity53 , who has worked for a long time in the @entity12 merchant navy , told @entity0 's @entity65 that he had " sailed those oceans several times myself
" @entity68 authorities coordinating the search for the plane in a remote area of the @entity12 suspended efforts on tuesday because of stormy weather
@entity53 said he hoped the search would continue
" just for the relatives to see that there was something -- and it 's conclusive evidence , " he said
@entity80 , whose partner of two years , @entity81 , was on the passenger jet , said in an e-mailed statement that , without confirmed wreckage , the announcement gave her " no real closure
" " i still feel his presence , so perhaps it was his soul all along , " she said of @entity81 , one of three @entity88 on the plane
' still holding onto hope ' the reactions are understandable , said @entity93 , the founder of @entity94 , an organization that provides grief support to people affected by or involved in air disasters
" i think that what we have been hearing is that basically this is n't enough evidence to change the grieving process , " she told @entity0 's @entity99
" some people are still holding on to hope and really need more than these words
" " they need to see actual parts of the plane and really learn that their loved ones were actually on board by getting some remains back , " said @entity93 , who lost her @entity108 Â© on @entity109 , which crashed in 1996
" i am so glad there is some new information coming to them , " she said of the @entity9 announcement
" but really , without anything tangible , they are still going back and forth
" @entity9 acting transportation minister @entity121 said tuesday he understood that relatives found it difficult to accept the news without hard evidence
" until we can find the debris , and then we can confirm the debris is from @entity4 , it is very difficult for me to have closure for the families , " he said
' tantalizingly unsatisfying ' aviation experts also expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the information
" we 've been waiting for the shoe to drop for more than two weeks now
and what we got was the most tantalizingly unsatisfying thread of a resolution , " @entity137 , a private pilot and aviation writer , told @entity0
@entity0 aviation analyst @entity142 said he wanted to see more information about what was behind @entity9 authorities ' announcement
" there is a saying in science : extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence , " he said
" the @entity154 government , whose citizens made up about two thirds of the passengers on the plane , says it also wants to know more
" we called on the @entity9 side to provide further evidence and all the information , " @entity154 foreign ministry spokesman @entity160 said at a news briefing tuesday
portrait of an artist : the @entity169 painter on @entity4 ' nothing is final ' an executive from @entity172 , the @entity17 company that carried out the satellite analysis , said the route into the southern @entity12 was the " best fit " with the pings received from the plane
" the most likely route is the south , and the most likely ending in roughly the area where they 're looking now , " @entity178 , a senior vice president at the company , told @entity0 's @entity180
" but , of course , nothing is final , " he said
" we 're not earth observation satellites , we 're data satellites
so it will require a lot of different skills , a lot of different people , not least the naked eye , to finally confirm what happened to 370
" @entity178 said the mathematics - based process used by @entity172 and @entity17 's @entity197 was " groundbreaking
" the new calculations underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by @entity203 , he said
@entity204 , an aviation attorney , said he was troubled by the different language used by the satellite company and @entity9 officials
" on the one hand , you have the executive from @entity172 saying ' most likely ' and somehow that got booted up to ' beyond reasonable doubt
' i do n't agree with that , " @entity204 said
" i am not convinced that they are certain where this airplane is , " he said
" i think they have fine - tuned it to a general area , but to say beyond a reasonable doubt this plane went down where they are saying is a stretch
" @entity9 defends announcement prime minister @entity8 on tuesday defended the decision to make the announcement , saying it was based on " the most conclusive information we have
" he told @entity230 he did n't want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers -- an accusation @entity9 authorities faced earlier in the investigation into the plane 's disappearance
he noted that more answers would only come to light with the discovery of the plane 's flight data recorder
" we can not verify any theories until the black box is found , " he said
search for @entity4 : the technology how ' groundbreaking ' number crunching found path of @entity4 ' they have told us all lives are lost , ' says relative of @entity19 passenger @entity0 's @entity258 and journalist @entity259 contributed to this report .
