-- there 's no skirting around the issue -- short shorts , long shorts -- it does n't matter to the biggest name in women 's football , @entity8
who better to talk about the struggles facing the sport than the woman known across the world as " the female @entity14 ? " in fact , if you ask @entity14 himself , largely acknowledged to be the greatest player to have ever kicked a football , he will tell you that he calls her " @entity14 with skirts
" unlike the suggestion of @entity26 president @entity25 , who said in 2004 that women soccer players could wear skimpier outfits to make the sport more appealing , @entity14 's comment was taken as a compliment
" let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball , " @entity25 said at the time
" they could , for example , have tighter shorts
" which clothes players wear are irrelevant according to @entity8 -- but ensuring that women 's football retains a sense of femininity is important to the five - time @entity41
" i 'm all in favor of us not losing our essence , our female side , because we are women and we have to be proud of that , " the @entity43 star told @entity0 's " an @entity45 " documentary
" we have to have some vanity ; we have to take care of ourselves and keep our spirits high
i think what really matters is the support you get in football regardless of the uniform you wear
" some girls feel good playing in long shorts while some of them feel good playing in tighter shorts
i 'm not against it
it 's obvious that women have to explore that female side of things and i do n't think that 's a mistake
" campaigner @entity8 is one of the most vocal campaigners in the battle for equality in women 's football
not bad for a girl who grew up in @entity75 , playing football on the streets against boys twice her size and without any formative coaching until the age of 14
fast forward to 2013 , and the 27 - year - old is one of the most recognizable faces in the sport , starring for @entity87 side @entity86 in @entity88
like @entity8 , women 's football has come a long way too since it held its debut at the @entity92 in @entity93 , where nearly 80,000 watched the @entity94 win gold
three years later , over 90,000 people were packed into the @entity98 @entity97 , @entity99 , for the 1999 @entity100 as the @entity94 defeated @entity101
on the club front , the @entity105 @entity104 women 's @entity102 has been gaining in popularity since its inception in 2001
and yet still @entity8 believes that attitudes towards women within football have remained stuck in the past
prejudice " i think it has changed a bit but that mentality still exists , " she said
" there 's still prejudice and that resistance regarding women not only on female football but in various activities
" men think that women are a bit fragile to perform some types of activities or do n't have the ability and are n't strong enough
" that does n't exist anymore
women have shown they have capabilities in every sense better than men a lot of time , but it 's that whole macho thing
" @entity137 in @entity43 is seen as a masculine sport , even with a lot of people accepting the female sport
there 's still a percentage that thinks like in the old days
" while women 's football has struggled to gain its share of the limelight in @entity43 , the sport is booming across the globe
according to the latest figures published by @entity26 , the world 's governing body , 29 million women and girls play football worldwide
that 's a huge increase from 1971 , when three international teams played just two matches -- by 2011 there were 129 teams playing 514 games
but while the women 's game has grown in the @entity94 and @entity104 , progress has been far more difficult to achieve in @entity43
even the achievements of the national team , which has won two silver medals and finished as runner - up at the last @entity100 , has not been enough to get the professional game off the ground
fighting " when you have competitions like the @entity173 or the @entity100 , then it captures people 's attention and that of the media , " said @entity8
" but when that moment has passed and @entity43 has n't played well or won , then you lose that attention
" maybe that 's what 's missing for people who can do something for @entity43 female football , to actually wake up and change the reality of female football because we have three medals
" those three medals till today were useless because our reality has n't changed that much
there was a promise of starting a league , of doing this , of doing that , but in reality nothing was done and we are still fighting
" we want to try and carry @entity43 's name to the top but we do n't have the support
" @entity8 was 21 when she played in front of a staggering 70,000 at @entity205 's famous @entity204 -- an occasion where @entity43 defeated the @entity94 under - 20 team in the final of the 2007 @entity209
but that attendance is an anomaly in a country where the game has little chance of competing for media attention against the constant frenzy surrounding men 's football
funding is scarce , sponsorship even more so , and while women 's football is televised on a regular level in the @entity94 in @entity104 , @entity43 is still lagging behind
@entity8 , who has played in the @entity94 and now in @entity223 , has seen first hand the benefits of having sponsors and investment -- and now wants companies to invest in @entity43 's women
weaker sex " there 's still the prejudice of thinking women are the weaker sex or that they were n't born to play sports , " @entity8 said
" i think people need to stop that and give us credit
" i know that when people come to invest they want an immediate return , but that does n't happen
" there needs to be a schedule
with investment you will have television companies broadcasting the games and you will have more sponsorship
" if we work on a project to bring more people to the stadium then television companies and sponsors will look at this and think it 's a cool initiative
" that will lead them to get even more involved
it has to be something where every side can be involved but it has to be out of solidarity and not to gain something out of female football , because at this point we ca n't really give away immediate return
" @entity269 a lack of funding and investment combined with the demise of her former club , @entity276 , paints a bleak picture for the women 's game in @entity43
but for someone who has broken down barriers from the very time she first touched a football as an inquisitive youngster , there is still hope
according to @entity8 , the @entity43 @entity287 , the government and @entity26 are all working together to establish a women 's league which will be made possible through outside investment
" there is hope for the future , " she said
" i hope they will create a league to give continuity and allow the girls to learn the basics so when they graduate to the national team , they are ready and developed
" i really hope that happens , if not in my generation then in the ones that follow
