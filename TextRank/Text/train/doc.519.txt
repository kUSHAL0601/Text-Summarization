-- president @entity2 's remarks monday on @entity3 were in some ways the most significant of his presidency
they were , at their core , about the role of government -- all governments -- and the responsibility of citizens to take care of themselves and each other when times are tough
by embracing self - reliance and resiliency -- " take care of yourselves " and " we will get through this " were themes -- @entity2 did more to defend and explain the role of government than any presidential debate ever could
the message was political , but not in the partisan sense
it was more akin to the debates at @entity30 's founding on the role of government , and included an appropriate sense of tough love
it was a statement to the nation that reality is sometimes cruel and challenging
it was not filled with a " we got this " bravado
it would have been a lie for @entity2 to say so ; as he noted , this is a massive storm , and -- by meteorologists ' accounts -- of a different nature from what responders have seen before
he did not promise instantaneous response , explaining that first responders and utility company workers should not put themselves at risk until conditions are safer
nor did he claim that all would be back to normal immediately
politics : looking presidential -- the optics of leadership during a disaster that messaging was not an accident , nor was it partisan
in the statements from the @entity63 to statehouses both @entity65 and @entity66 , there 's a hint that @entity3 may help engender a new discussion about our resiliency
the measure of our success has as much to do with our initial response to a crisis as it does with restoring the mechanisms that support our commerce and transportation and all other aspects of our infrastructure
the value of a stronger infrastructure is not just that it does n't fall apart when the winds howl , but that if operations are interrupted , it gets running again as soon as possible
it is not too early to think about @entity3 as a key point in policy discussions about our aging infrastructure and our lack of commitment to it
for the last several years , infrastructure enhancements have often been tied to the economic debate
the stimulus package had a dual purpose : get roads fixed , bridges modernized , transportation systems upgraded , and all while putting people back to work
it was an important effort , but its public message referred primarily to jobs and the economy , not public safety
that we have to hunker down for the next few days is a basic -- and correct -- safety response to the wrath of such a storm
but @entity2 also noted an obvious fact : our ability to bounce back -- to get the power lines restored , the transportation systems running -- is no small feat. when a storm puts 60 million people in danger , sends tens of thousands across the eastern seaboard fleeing to the high ground to escape a surge made more threatening by a century of rising sea level ; when it essentially shuts down @entity125 , bringing the transportation system to a halt and even shutting down the stock exchange -- it is not just a matter of safety in this storm
when we talk about upgrading and improving our infrastructure , we are talking about maintaining our resiliency as nature serves up ever more complicated , unpredictable weather in our new era of climate change
politics : 5 things to watch in hurricane - wracked campaign how to do this ? there are plenty of solutions , many with bipartisan support
one involves creating an infrastructure bank , where the private sector directly invests in infrastructure projects , as is the case in many countries , with the promise that toll fees will bring in the financial gains
architects embrace a concept of resilient design : for example , a new bridge across @entity158 will sway with an earthquake rather than resist it
public policy planners from @entity125 to @entity163 are grappling with how to make investments and drive activity , even as big weather puts much of the last century 's infrastructure at risk , and sometimes under water
electric companies that have fought government requirements to submerge power lines will face criticism about why so many lines are vulnerable
if storms like @entity3 are likely in the future , we will begin to see a move toward a more resilient infrastructure , starting with projects that are already under way
local and state governments are likely to require that primary power cables are underground and protected
design competitions are just beginning to make resiliency a priority for public projects
anticipate much more of this in the future ; and , after the election , expect the infrastructure bank idea to gain momentum as legislators recognize that it might be better for the private sector to pay for projects that benefit their communities
shutting down , as we all are doing this week , makes sense
but afterward , the real focus has to be on getting better at starting back up
no nation is immune to harm , but prepared nations are quicker at getting back to normal
@entity3 has caused a lot of damage and suffering , but there are many emergency managers , architects , city planners and politicians who hope that it may also refocus a political effort to invest and upgrade
it is good for the economy , yes , but more important , it is good for our safety
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .
