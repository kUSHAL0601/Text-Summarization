-- in many ways , the critically acclaimed film " @entity1 " is about hopes and dreams
when @entity6 , one of the movie 's stars , was growing up in @entity9 , @entity10 , she too longed for something
" i 've always wanted to be famous , " the actress and comedian said
" i enjoyed watching famous people and so i wanted to be that
i just was n't sure how i was going to do it
" " it was n't until i saw this woman named @entity19 doing this show called ' people are talking ' [ a local talk show winfrey co-hosted while she was at @entity9 's @entity22 ] that i said ' that is what i want to do right there
' " @entity6 has achieved that dream -- she 's now hosting a @entity27 on @entity28 -- and so much more
with her portrayal of an abusive mother in " @entity1 , " the singularly named entertainer is burning brightly in @entity32 these days
she 's been nominated for both a @entity33 and a @entity34 for her film performance , singled out as one of @entity38 's most intriguing persons of 2009 and won a @entity39 for @entity40 at the @entity41
with all of the accolades and the many critics who have hailed her performance , it 's only natural that people are excited about the possibility of an @entity50 nomination everyone it seems , except for @entity6
she talked to @entity0 about why she 's taking it one day at a time , her influence as a plus - sized role model and why she 's never met a curse word she did n't like
@entity0 : it seems like people ca n't stop talking about you and awards , especially the big one , yet you seem decidedly low key about it
why is that ? @entity6 : i 'm very appreciative of it , but i ca n't let it drive me crazy
it 's a part of the process but i ca n't go crazy with it because i 'm also a wife and a mother , a talk show host and a stand - up comic
@entity75 willing if it happens , it happens and if it does n't , i understand
@entity0 : now that you are famous , is it all that you imagined ? @entity6 : baby , when i tell you it is all that i thought it would be and then things i could n't even imagine
if i say what i have done in my career , you almost want to say " girl stop lying ! " @entity0 : years ago , you said your co-star on the television show " @entity89 , " @entity86 , expressed some concerns about your acting ability
now with all of the praise you are getting as an actress , what do you have to say to that ? @entity6 : ( @entity96 ) he did say that ! he said , " she needs some work
" i am going to have to remind him of that the next time i talk to him
@entity0 : how have you worked on your craft as an actress ? @entity6 : just experiencing and enjoying life
for me , i love to entertain , but i love being honest while entertaining
when i played @entity108 on " @entity89 , " i loved that woman and she was very honest
you just have to be right there in the moment
@entity0 : what , if anything , did you love about the @entity115 , the character of the mother in " @entity1 " ? @entity6 : what i loved about @entity115 is that she was open , she let you see it and she was vulnerable
and in the end she was crying out for help
when you watch @entity115 throughout that film she was a monster until that very last scene
for as cruel as she was , she let you know that she was human and that she was sick
@entity0 : you have been open about the sexual abuse you said you suffered as a child at the hands of a family member
did those memories make it difficult to go there with this role ? @entity6 : it was n't difficult at all because i had already dealt with it
i had already gone through therapy
when mr. [ @entity141 ] @entity140 [ the film 's director ] called me for the role i was excited
i thought , " oh good , this story is going to get told
it 's not going to get swept under the rug anymore
" i knew @entity115 , i knew that character
so when mr. @entity140 said " action , " i wanted to bring as much honesty as i could so people know that this is real
like she really exists and it can be you
that 's why i say i do n't focus on the awards because we have already won because this movie is changing lives
i had an @entity161 brother come up to me after a screening in @entity163
we were all standing outside in the lobby and the way he was approaching had everyone a little uneasy
he came over to me and he said " what i am about to say to you is going to sound a little weird , but i am @entity115
i was @entity115 to my little brother and my sister
" we were embracing and he 's crying and i said " congratulations brother
now go get yourself some help
" @entity0 : on a lighter note , your late - night talk show on @entity28 does n't even seem like you are working
it seems like you are out there playing
@entity6 : baby , i am having so much fun ! we promised ourselves that it would be a party
the way the world is right now , not just @entity187 , but the world , we feel like people want to feel good when they go to bed at night
they want to feel like tomorrow is going to be all right
with the music , the dancing , the audience , the guests , i am having my own little party out there
@entity0 : you look great doing it
how have you lost so much weight ? @entity6 : i made a commitment to working out , but it is very challenging to watch what i put in my mouth
the main reason i did it was because of my children [ 4 - year - old twins and a teenaged son ]
i want to meet their children and so i have to show the universe i am willing to put in the work to be able to meet future generations if i am allowed
@entity0 : you have been such an inspiration to plus - sized women
do you worry about losing that demographic as you slim down ? @entity6 : i do n't
right now i fluctuate between 217 and 222 and i would like to get to an even 200
i do n't worry about losing my fluffy sisters because i am excited about sharing the news
i 'm excited to say , " listen , we are big women and we are going to be big women until we leave here , but let 's be big , healthy , curvaceous women
" for me , when i was 262 pounds , just for me , i did n't want anybody cutting on me , sucking stuff out , stapling me or any of that
i wanted to make the commitment and put the work in
i might not make it to 200 for another two years , but i ai n't worried about it
i 'm still going to put the work in
@entity0 : do you miss doing stand - up ? @entity6 : please ! i have n't stopped doing stand - up
they are trying to put the tour schedule together right now
my husband , who is the executive producer for the talk show , says " you need that " and i get about six minutes of it with the show
but sometimes i find myself wanting to go to the left on them and i have to hold back and say " wait , i know someone from the @entity243 is watching
" @entity0 : yeah , how do you tone that down for television because , based on your stand - up routines , you clearly like to cuss
@entity6 : ( @entity96 ) @entity248 is great ! it is beautiful
it 's a stress reliever
it keeps your blood pressure down
@entity253 n't nothing wrong with cussing
i come from a family of cussers , baby
listen , growing up , my aunts and uncles , you would go over their house to play spades and there would be some cussing going on and you 'd have to say " i did n't even know you could put those words together ! " but the way my aunt did it , it was like she was singing to me
i would say to myself " @entity75 , when i get grown , watch out ! "
