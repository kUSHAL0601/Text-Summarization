@entity0 -- the man convicted of videotaping her through a hotel peephole was sentenced to two years in prison , @entity7 reporter @entity6 said tuesday , but in a way , she was sentenced to a lifetime of looking over her shoulder
" the one thing that i think is very , very sad about the whole ordeal is , he 's going to jail for a little over two years , " said @entity6 , who appeared with members of @entity12 on tuesday in support of legislation to strengthen federal stalking laws
" that video on the @entity20 will be there for the rest of my life
" someday , she said , she will need to explain the video to her future husband and children
" these stories are not easy to talk about , " @entity6 said
" it 's so funny
i work in the public eye
i 'm used to these cameras all the time , but it 's easier for me to talk about touchdowns and errors
... this is not easy for me at all
" the legislation -- simplifying the @entity36 , keeping everyone @entity37 , or @entity39 -- was introduced in the @entity40 last week by @entity41
@entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 , @entity45
the " long overdue " bill is set for debate on the @entity40 floor tuesday , @entity42 said
stalking laws have not caught up with emerging technology , she said , and the bill will bring the laws into the present " to give law enforcement the tools they need to combat stalking in the digital age
" the legislation would cover technologies such as electronic monitoring , spyware , bugging and video surveillance , she said
a victim presently must have a " reasonable fear of physical injury " before a case can be prosecuted , she said , and sometimes that is too late
" the bottom line : stalking is about power and control , " she said
" it 's a violation of the worst kind , and we need to put a law in place in our justice system that helps us and gives us every available tool
" sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , said she plans to introduce a companion bill in the @entity82 and is procuring a @entity84 author
a former prosecutor , @entity79 said that although stalking is " one of the most invasive crimes , " it can be difficult to prove and tricky to prosecute
she thanked @entity6 for coming forward but noted , " there are cases like this all over the country every day " involving women who are not in the public eye
she recalled a case in @entity97 in which an online relationship soured and a man posted pictures of a woman 's children , along with their full names , addresses and telephone number , on child pornography sites , encouraging people to molest them
in march , a federal judge sentenced an @entity110 man to 2 1/2 years in prison for taping @entity6 in the nude through the peephole and posting the video on the @entity20
@entity115 , 49 , pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in december after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of @entity6
" i have seen with my own eyes through firsthand experience that the laws have been taken way too lightly
they are n't clear , and they have not kept up with the technology or the time , " @entity6 said , her voice shaking at times
" at times over the past year , i have screamed
i have said to my family , ' why me ? why is this happening to me ? ' " but , she said , she received " countless letters -- i 'm still receiving them -- from women who say , ' please go out and fight this
please go out and show your face
' ... i 'm showing my face
i 'm lending my voice
and i 'm here to give this law some teeth
" she said her message to victims is , " there is hope , and there is help , and if you need help , do not be ashamed to ask for it
" the legislation increases penalties for offenses where a restraining order is in place and for offenses involving children or the elderly , lawmakers said
currently , the federal law applies only to criminals who travel over state lines , but the new legislation will cover any conduct that criminals engage in that affects interstate commerce , @entity42 and @entity79 said
although most stalking cases are prosecuted at the state level , the federal law will serve as a model , they said .
