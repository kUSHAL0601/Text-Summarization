@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 marked a holiday that leads up to the @entity4 new year under the watchful eyes of police tuesday night after the @entity8 's supreme leader tried to discourage the celebrations
thousands of people turned out , some in groups as large as 400 people , to dance , listen to music and light bonfires in side streets around @entity0 on the festival of @entity18
but unlike other holidays in recent months , there was no immediate sign that the observance was becoming a platform for protests against the country 's leadership
parties continued into early wednesday , including one in the northern neighborhood of @entity29 where about 150 people danced to music pouring out of cars in the neighborhood
some revelers played cat - and - mouse games with police who roamed the streets , looking to break up ongoing celebrations
watch @entity40 video of men dancing around a fire ayatollah @entity44 , the country 's supreme leader , had urged @entity1 to ignore @entity18 , an ancient festival held on the eve of the last wednesday before spring
it dates back thousands of years and leads up to @entity49 , the holiday that begins with the first day of spring and the @entity4 new year , which falls on saturday this year
watch @entity40 video of people throwing fireworks in @entity0 in a statement published by @entity1 news sites , @entity44 said the festivities have no basis in @entity59 , and can cause " harm and corruption
" " it is appropriate to avoid it , " he said
watch @entity40 video of revelers in @entity0 shouting " death to the dictator " @entity1 has been wracked by anti-government demonstrations since the disputed june 12 presidential vote that resulted in the re-election of hardline president @entity71
the government has beefed up security to ensure " order and calm " during the two - week period celebrating @entity49 , stationing 200,000 security personnel across the country , according to @entity71 's official news site
tuesday 's celebrations were closely monitored by police in @entity0 , with officers randomly stopping and searching cars around @entity83 and other major streets and plazas
are you in @entity1 ? send photos , videos of the protests in one case , brief clashes broke out late tuesday between revelers and plainclothed members of the @entity94 , the pro-government paramilitary militia , who chased them away with batons and stun guns
and in one eastern @entity0 neighborhood , security forces spray - painted passing cars from which motorists were tossing firecrackers
police at checkpoints around the city were looking for the marked vehicles
a video posted on @entity40 showed what the poster said was an anti-government protest in another @entity0 neighborhood , where protesters could be heard chanting " death to the dictator
" earlier in the week , the chief prosecutor in the eastern city of @entity117 warned that those who engaged in " disruptive behavior " during @entity18 would face " strong consequences
" it 's a precaution that 's become increasingly commonplace in @entity1 , especially in advance of holidays , as the government continues to warn against political demonstrations that have emerged since last summer 's disputed presidential elections
the @entity1 government quashed anti-government protests that brewed in february as the nation commemorated the 31st anniversary of the @entity131 , which marked the end of the country 's @entity134 - backed monarchy and the start of an @entity59 republic
in the days that led up to the february 11 holiday , the government mobilized security forces and heightened its warnings , saying it would arrest protesters and hold them until the end of @entity49 , on april 9
six protesters who were arrested in december on the @entity59 holiday of @entity147 were sentenced to death on monday , the day before @entity18 , the semi-official @entity144 reported monday
their sentences are being reviewed by an appeals court , @entity144 said
another 86 people were found guilty tuesday of acts against the @entity59 republic , @entity1 's semi-official @entity144 reported
@entity153 and @entity154 of @entity0 said most of the defendants were given prison sentences
meanwhile , around 350 inmates at @entity158 have gone on a hunger strike to demand that their cases be examined before @entity49 , saying their ward is so overcrowded with recent political arrestees that prisoners are in poor health , according to the @entity165 , an @entity1 group
eyewitnesses in @entity1 said thousands of riot police and security officers lined the streets of the capital , @entity0 , and patrolled major intersections on motorcycles and on foot monday night
beginning saturday , police also have set up checkpoints along major roads in @entity0 , and vehicles have been stopped and searched from late at night into the early morning hours , witnesses said
@entity2 's @entity179 contributed to this report .
