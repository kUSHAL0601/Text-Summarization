, the terrorist group which @entity1 intelligence agencies believe may have been behind the @entity15 attack in @entity16 , @entity1 officials tell @entity5
they say the new measures will feature additional random checks after passengers make it through security and will include passenger pat - downs , bag checks and hand swabs for traces of explosives
the new issue of @entity13 's @entity29 magazine , released on december 24 , featured instructions on how to build what @entity13 called a " hidden bomb " from easily purchasable materials
it also included directions on how would - be lone wolves worldwide can evade airport security scanners and sniffer dogs
in recent months , @entity13 's leadership has repeatedly stated hitting the @entity1 is a priority
the new issue of @entity29 made clear it viewed lone wolf attacks by its supporters in the @entity44 as an increasingly important part of these efforts
the magazine claimed the recipe was for a simplified version of the device used in an attempt to blow up a @entity1 passenger jet over @entity53 five years ago
on christmas day 2009 , @entity54 , the so - called " underwear bomber , " attempted to detonate an explosive device built by @entity56 , @entity13 's master bomb - maker , on a flight from @entity59 to @entity53
the main charge -- a white powdery explosive called @entity62 which airport security scanners at @entity59 did not detect -- failed to detonate as the plane approached @entity53
the new recipe does not involve the manufacture of @entity62 , a substance difficult for extremists to manufacture or obtain in the @entity44
instead , it contains similarities to a bomb formula put out by the group in the first issue of @entity29 in 2010 called " make a bomb in the @entity74
" that recipe was downloaded and used by the @entity76 bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the @entity80
in the new issue , @entity13 suggested its external operation division had greenlighted sharing the recipe because @entity56 and his team had developed a new generation of more sophisticated devices
what is @entity13 ? in 2012 @entity88 and @entity44 intelligence foiled a plot by @entity13 to bomb a @entity1 plane with an updated version of the underwear device
it is not clear if the recipe is viable or if it would have enough explosive power to endanger an aircraft
nor is it clear if the device would have any chance of getting through explosive scanners at airport security
@entity1 officials and explosive detection experts tell @entity5 that advanced detection equipment , including body scanners , should catch even previously hard - to - detect explosives like @entity62 , even if detection experts say they do n't provide a 100 % guarantee
but @entity1 officials say advanced body - scanning technology is not available in some smaller @entity1 airports
the authors of the latest issue of @entity29 magazine claimed that if enough lone wolves launch attempts with their suggested device , some would get through
the magazine stated that even if the devices were detected or malfunctioned they would bring terror to the @entity44
the key aim , the group stated , was to undermine the @entity1 economy
it listed several @entity1 airline companies , as well as @entity128 and @entity129 carriers as targets
it said that lone wolves should claim responsibility by writing emails timed to be distributed after their operations
in the 112 - page issue the group also mentioned recent lone wolf attackers in @entity140 , the @entity1 , @entity141 and @entity129 , calling a hatchet attack on @entity144 police officers in @entity145 in october " splendid
" counterterrorism officials on both sides of the @entity80 been concerned about technical instruction provided by @entity29 for several years
in august 2013 the @entity128 security agency @entity149 revealed to the @entity128 parliament 's intelligence and security committee that " @entity29 " has been " read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the @entity128 since its first issue ( in 2010 )
we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots
