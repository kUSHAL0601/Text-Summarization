-- modern medicine is very good at some things , and really lousy at others
as i wrote in a blog last week , psychiatry is no different in this regard
we understand some types of aberrant behavior pretty well and can do things to help resolve it
but , unfortunately , in other instances - and often the most interesting ones - we can only mumble generalities that require no special expertise and that offer no hope for a diagnosis or treatment
consider filmmaker @entity19 , director of " @entity20 " , a much debated video about an @entity22 warlord
several weeks ago , @entity19 was apprehended by police in @entity24 after running naked through the streets , pounding his fists on the pavement and shouting incoherently
this is certainly an unexpected and bizarre turn of events for a well - regarded and previously normal filmmaker
however , from a psychiatric perspective , this behavior is neither unexpected nor bizarre
in fact , it happens all the time
if you 'd asked 100 psychiatrists for their diagnosis of mr. @entity19 upon first hearing the story , i 'd bet more than 90 of them would instantly say " manic episode "
why ? because people who develop severe mania almost always demonstrate bizarre agitated behavior , and usually utter what sounds like nonsense to others
and as most psychiatrists will attest , nakedness is a behavior commonly seen in catatonic episodes
i ca n't begin to count the number of manic patients i 've treated who went naked in public prior to landing in the hospital
and i 'll never forget the mental images i have of various manic patients lumbering naked down corridors in the psychiatric inpatient unit , much to the dismay of everyone but themselves
manic episodes can be caused by various factors
most of the time they occur in people with bipolar disorder , which is a devastating psychiatric condition characterized by alternating manias and depressions
but manias also can be caused by drugs of abuse , medications , and more rarely , by medical problems such as hormone imbalances , seizures or brain tumors
even in people with bipolar disorder , manias do n't come out of thin air , but are usually sparked by stress and its evil attendant , sleep loss
this appears to have been the most likely causative factor in the case of mr. @entity19
the good news about manias is that they can almost always be treated , and sometimes very rapidly
several classes of medications almost always resolve manic episodes within several weeks
occasionally something as simple as a single good night 's sleep will resolve a manic episode
i would n't believe this if i had n't seen it myself on numerous occasions
in the end it appears that , according to his family , mr. @entity19 has received the diagnosis of " @entity102
" this label tells us nothing about what caused mr. @entity19 's episode , what pattern of symptoms he experienced , or what his future is likely to hold
like all current psychiatric diagnoses it is only a description of his symptoms
it says mr. @entity19 was briefly psychotic and is now doing better
with a little bit of luck it will be his last such diagnosis .
