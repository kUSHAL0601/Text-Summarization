-- after an anxious three - month wait , residents of a northwest @entity3 town that lost 18 residents and its business core to an ef - 5 tornado learned monday night that their largest employer will rebuild -- and may add jobs
the announcement by @entity11 elicited joyous responses by @entity13 , @entity3 , residents -- many of whom honked their horns -- and on @entity19 pages that had followed the developments
" it feels like the weight of the world has been lifted off your shoulders , " said @entity13 police chief @entity21
the april 27 tornado leveled the @entity29 distribution center and killed one employee
it also destroyed or damaged 31 of 32 businesses in town , wiping away most of the town government 's revenue sources
nearly 500 homes were damaged or destroyed
the new facility will be larger , more modern and could bring an additional 50 positions to the community -- for a total of approximately 200 employees , @entity11 said in a statement
it also will have the potential to handle additional shipping capacity
the company , based in @entity46 , @entity47 , will break ground in the second quarter of 2012
@entity51 date for completion is mid-year 2013
" throughout the evaluation , @entity13 remained our leading option based on multiple factors , notably a work force who has demonstrated a passion for their work and a commitment to our company , " ceo @entity53 said
" we are also grateful to the state of @entity3 for the support and assistance it has provided
we are pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with @entity13 and look forward to a bright future
" @entity73 , state and local officials had conducted a full - court press , offering a range of incentives to @entity11 , including $ 300,000 from the town and @entity78 , with millions more from the state
town officials said monday night gov. @entity81 was crucial to the effort
since the tornado , the majority of the displaced workers have been employed at company - owned locations in @entity13 and , about 70 miles away , in @entity88 , @entity3
the @entity88 location will close once the new @entity13 distribution center is open
no jobs will be lost because that facility was brought back on line to provide work to the displaced @entity13 employees
the @entity13 distribution center shipped pallets of @entity29 clothing to @entity99 , @entity51 and other retailers around the country
one of five @entity29 distribution points in the nation , the center was well - run and efficient , the company said in june while it was evaluating the site and other distribution facilities
but some of the town 's nearly 1,500 residents had worried that @entity29 would not rebuild
@entity13 's mayor had said the return of @entity29 was crucial for the town 's recovery
" the morale boost it 's given this town is unbelievable , " mayor pro tem @entity115 said after the announcement
leaders had worried about possible layoffs , including in the police force , but monday 's development , the return of some businesses and donations -- including from a @entity128 -- will brighten the economic outlook
residents are hopeful the approximately 150 people who left town after the tornado will return
the @entity13 tornado was one of 62 twisters and storms that swept through @entity3 on april 27 , killing 247 people
@entity139 and @entity140 , @entity13 's only doctor , told @entity0 monday night the announcement may eventually draw new employers and convince others that had n't started rebuilding to do so
@entity145 , who co-owns the @entity147 convenience store , likened the excitement monday night of residents in their 50s and 60s to kids on prom night
" people are smiling , " she said
" it 's just great , great , great
