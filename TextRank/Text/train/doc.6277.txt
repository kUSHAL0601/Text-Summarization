-- new @entity2 sensation @entity1 completed the 100 - 200 sprint double at the @entity4 in @entity5 on friday but only after a desperately close finish to the longer race
@entity1 , who won the 100m title on wednesday , hit the front in his final stride as he overhauled and then outdipped @entity12 's @entity11 to win in 20.37 seconds
@entity13 , so often the nearly man at major championships , led from the gun and was clocked in 20.38 seconds
@entity1 's compatriot @entity16 took his second bronze of the championships after finishing third in the 100m
the 20 - year - old @entity1 has burst onto the scene this year , breaking the 10 second barrier for the 100m
he succeeds @entity24 's @entity23 , who also achieved the 100m - 200m double in 2006
he will now target a third gold medal as part of a strong @entity2 team in the 4x100m relay this weekend .
