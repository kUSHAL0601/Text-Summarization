-- all eyes shifted toward the beginning of the runway when a dark - haired model strutted out in a star - spangled red bikini to a fusillade of flashbulbs at @entity9 's @entity8 show on monday
she fit right in at nearly 5 ' 11 " tall with a svelte frame
but despite adhering to the anonymous runway model aesthetic , @entity12 tends to stand out
she 's on a first - name basis with millions
just look at her stats : on @entity16 , she has almost 7 million followers ; on @entity18 , 8.75 million ; and on @entity19 , a whopping 13.3 million
the teen , who appears alongside her paparazzi - favorite family in " keeping up with @entity22 , " is trying to find her own footing in the high - fashion world without her polarizing siblings and parents
" you just do n't know how ( casting directors ) are going to react to it
it could be like ' oh , just another reality tv star coming in , trying to be something , ' " @entity30 said
" this is what i want to do
... this is my career
this is what i wanted to be
" during this @entity8 , which ends thursday , @entity30 has made enviable strides by modeling for @entity40 , @entity9 and @entity41
in @entity43 's show , she walked behind legendary supermodel @entity44 and @entity46 @entity45 , both of whom @entity30 says she looks up to
the 18 - year - old is on the cover of the september issue of @entity51 and appears in the fashion - heavy september issue of its high - end counterpart , @entity51
this year , she walked for high - fashion brands overseas like @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59
" when i started , i had no idea how this was going to turn out , " she said
" it 's still so surreal that i 've walked in shows like @entity59 and @entity57
" like anything @entity68 - related , @entity30 's presence in this world has not come without controversy : where models are dodging street style photographers , she 's dodging paparazzi and hit pieces in the media about the distraction her presence brings
compared with some of her high - fashion counterparts who can walk upwards of 20 runways during the weeklong event before heading to @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity30 is still a fledgling in her second season , with three shows thus far
despite it all , her name does garner press
see all of @entity92 's @entity8 coverage before @entity8 started , she decided to omit her last name from her casting card , which is sent out to runway suitors from her agency , @entity96
" i just felt like i did n't want a last name to help me in any way , " @entity30 said , making it clear that the decision is not a slight to her family
" whenever i went into a casting , i did n't need any special treatment
" but , to play the devil - in - @entity107 's advocate , she also credits growing up in front of a lens with helping her improve her modeling skills
her mother , @entity112 , is a business manager and executive producer for her family 's show , and her father is @entity118 decathlete @entity117
" whether it was a big tv camera or a little picture camera , i feel like i 've always been in front of a camera , " @entity30 said
modeling is an easy transition , she says , and something she 's wanted to do since she was a young girl
in her @entity8 debut in february , she made a splash with a chest - baring look for @entity129 , which @entity30 describes as a " ' hello world ' kind of moment
" it 's a far cry from the shy child she used to be
" when i was a kid , i could n't have a slumber party for one night without crying myself to sleep and telling my dad to pick me up at 10 o'clock at night , " @entity30 said
given her exposure , it 's easy to forget she 's a @entity141 girl , straight out of high school
" i was so terrified to get in a cab the first time i was here , " @entity30 admitted
as for what 's coming up for the ingenue , @entity30 shares two words familiar to any tv watcher : " stay tuned
