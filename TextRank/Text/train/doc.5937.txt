-- @entity1 is obsessed with the question of whether government can do anything anymore
with the lame duck session of @entity7 mired in confrontation over immigration and @entity7 about to shift to @entity11 hands in january , gridlock seems to define @entity1
but there is an issue where politics might work toward a legislative breakthrough rather than against it : the fight against @entity18
the spread of @entity18 has been an absolute disaster for several countries in @entity22
as voters learned in the weeks leading up to the election , families and communities have been utterly destroyed as a result of this horrendous disease
for a moment , @entity29 started to learn about how this disease could also spread to our own continent , as there were some cases of infected people within the @entity29
president @entity36 is requesting that @entity7 provide $ 6.2 billion in funding to combat the disease in @entity22 as part of the spending bill that @entity7 is now considering
the request comes after a potential breakthrough in the development of a vaccine that could have a major impact
money to develop this , as well as to strengthen the public health infrastructure in @entity22 , is urgently needed
" i think in some ways @entity18 has receded from the front page of the papers , but now is not the time to let down our guard , " one @entity50 official said
in the short term , the cynics are n't very optimistic -- and for good reason
legislators seemed to have forgotten the issue as soon as voters made their decisions in early november
but if the @entity50 handles the issue in the right way , the president might actually achieve his goals
president @entity36 can use the carrot and the stick to push republicans toward a compromise
with @entity18 , the carrot would be the appeal of republicans building on their own party 's public health record to demonstrate to voters -- who are starting to think about 2016 -- that they can govern
one of the greatest successes of president @entity80 's administration was the president 's @entity83 ( @entity83 ) initiative
often forgotten amid all the focus on @entity85 , torture , and the war on terrorism , @entity80 scored a huge policy success when he supported a massive infusion of funds into the effort to fight @entity93 in @entity22
as a result of the program , the number of people receiving care increased from 50,000 in 2004 to over one million by 2008
the initiative has been a big success and public health officials agree we are on the road to wiping out the disease
in 2012 , even as he was ramping up his partisan attacks in the presidential election on behalf of president @entity36 , former president @entity108 said : " i have to be grateful , and you should be too , that president @entity80 supported @entity83
it saved the lives of millions of people in poor countries
" @entity36 can ask republicans to join him with @entity18 and build on that public health record
at a time that many @entity29 think of the @entity11 as the party of obstruction -- good at attacking president @entity36 but not much else -- this could remind voters of what the @entity11 has helped to do and what they want to accomplish now
even if this does not make it into a temporary spending fix that the lame duck @entity7 might pass , the president must continue to turn up the heat in the coming year to get this done
then there is the stick
in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections , @entity11 candidates made a huge deal about the @entity18 crisis
they used this as a way to talk about how passive the president has been in dealing with the crises that the world has faced , from @entity18 to @entity140
the internet record is replete with statements calling on the @entity50 to do something
" i 'm concerned , " said @entity145 sen. @entity144 , " that the administration is not treating it with the gravity it deserves ...
" up to now , the @entity11 record is pretty thin
the @entity11 did not really offer any serious path forward and have not been jumping at the president 's proposals
now president @entity36 can float his measure and put them on the spot
he can use their record as a way for voters to start measuring whether the @entity11 are serious about governance or whether they just want to score political points
in this case , he can raise the question of whether they are willing to address a public health crisis that they acknowledged or whether they just talk about these issues for their own political gain
to be sure , we have seen repeatedly how solutions that seem most obvious for the parties to agree upon collapse in this age of partisan gridlock
nonetheless , if the president moves forward with this proposal and handles it in the right way , he will force @entity11 into a position of showing what they are all about -- real solutions or more gridlock
the @entity11 can be sure that @entity29 voters are watching closely .
