-- with a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze - your - north - face - off in the @entity7 , @entity1 packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation @entity12 beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain , @entity15
and , yes , there 's that famous trail
do n't worry , we 'll get to all of those
first some things you may not already know
@entity1 food : from guinea pigs to pisco sours 1
@entity29 is worth seeing while most international travelers land in @entity1 's current capital , many immediately continue on to the country 's former capital , @entity35 , in their rush to get to @entity37
@entity29 is @entity1 's largest city by far
it 's home to more than a quarter of @entity1 's roughly 30 million people , has wonderful food , the beautiful @entity42 ( where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye - catching patterns each time the tide rolls out ) and excellent museums
the @entity49 and its @entity50 is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms
reproductions of these works pop up all over @entity1 , notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood

you 're gon na love the ceviche fresh , raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue - tingling spices , ceviche is @entity1 's most popular dish , a must - try for any visitor
in @entity29 , internationally famed @entity72 is a great place to try it , but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country , from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants
@entity72 , 770 @entity78 , @entity29 ; +51 1 421 3365 3
there 's more to @entity1 than @entity80 most tourists come to @entity1 to see @entity37 or other @entity80 ruins , with maybe a few @entity84 churches thrown in for balance
this makes it easy to conclude , " there were the @entity80 , then the @entity89 came , which brings us to where we are now
" in fact , the @entity80 were a bit like @entity95 's @entity94 : they had a knack for taking control of long - established things and making them their own
the @entity80 state did n't emerge until the 1200s
it became an empire in the 1400s , and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533 , officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day
that said , the @entity113 people of @entity1 built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures , such as the @entity118 and the @entity119
was the @entity80 era a highlight of @entity1 history ? unquestionably
but when @entity1 museums boast artifacts from before @entity125 , focusing exclusively on @entity126 and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the @entity132 press
@entity134 rules @entity1 's beverage of choice is pisco , a brandy made from grapes
it 's also adored in @entity140 , inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace
available in numerous brands at varying prices , pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form , meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances , which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to @entity134 's blowtorch nuances
the most famous cocktail is the pisco sour , consisting of lime juice , simple syrup , egg white , ice and @entity160 bitters
there are assorted variations , such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness
if you 'd rather just have a beer , you 're in luck -- the local brews are good , with @entity171 a being a particularly refreshing option
cash is king , ideally in small bills travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that wo n't take @entity179 or @entity180 , much less @entity181
@entity1 offers an extra twist : occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them
in general , @entity1 like their soles ( the currency is the nuevo sol ) in small denominations : a fifty ( roughly $ 20 ) is ok , but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change
that noted , @entity1 tend to put great stock in @entity195 dollars , so even if an establishment does n't take credit cards and you do n't see an @entity199 , you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs
make sure your @entity195 and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills
altitude adjustment amounts to common sense @entity1 is a mountainous land , and you have to handle heights if you 're going to @entity35 , @entity37 and other landmarks of @entity80 culture
how to prepare ? the easiest method is drink lots of water , get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you 'll be fine
you can also consume stimulating coca leafs , whether in tea or by chewing them
the plumbing requires some @entity227 expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet
while @entity1 plumbing handles your waste , it does n't do toilet paper , which must be put in the bin next to the bowl
some bathrooms have signs stating this rule , others assume you know : remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken @entity89
the @entity244 is genuinely difficult along the famed trail you 'll often be reminded of the @entity1 proverb : " when the road is long , even slippers feel tight
" the @entity244 largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs were n't meant to be covered by mortals
the result is that the steps feel quite high for those who do n't answer to " @entity257 " or " @entity258
" if just reading this makes your knees swell , you may be in trouble
in addition , while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated , there 'll come a moment when you 're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you
throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your " waterproof " gear pretrek to make sure it 's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp
there are ways to ease your @entity80 pain depending on the company guiding you on the @entity244 , it 's possible to get porters to carry your tent , sleeping bag , food and ... well , they 'll essentially carry everything , including you , should your body completely fall to pieces
porters race ahead to the night 's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive , then cook and serve multiple - course meals , in certain cases on white linen table clothes
the result after a hard day 's walk is that you feel like you 've stepped out of " deliverance " and into " @entity299
" speaking of porters ... 10
porters are the toughest guys in the country whether you 're on your own or traveling like an @entity305 lord in the colonies , you 'll encounter porters on the @entity244
these men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money
they carry up to 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development , they used to handle positively spine - shattering loads -- and they carry it fast
some actually run along the trail , somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven , wet stones just to ensure all 's ready before the tourists stagger into camp
if you feel like racing your fellow hikers , great
do not test the porters : they 're pros , and you 're at best a promising amateur .
