-- this is a moment of terrible tragedy for @entity3 and people of goodwill everywhere following the discovery of the bodies of three teenagers who were abducted and killed while hitchhiking in the @entity9
it is also a moment of high danger
when an entire nation -- and the entirety of the @entity17 people -- is stunned and in deep mourning , it might be understandable that some among us would call for retribution
understandable -- but not necessarily wise
what we need is justice and to avoid a downward spiral of violence , not retribution
in the @entity17 world , we are all hurting right now , all angry
it is as if we have all suffered a death in our own family
those of us who are parents are imagining how we would feel if the victims had been our children
the funerals of the three teens were unbearably sad
as finance minister @entity37 said at the funeral procession of @entity39 , " let us remember that today we are burying a child
we are burying a child , who could have also been ours , and therefore he is also ours
we are not burying a settler or a soldier in the inevitable battle for this land
" opinion : teens ' killing hurts @entity3 , bad for @entity50 at a time like this , it is more important than ever to remember our heritage and our values
" justice , justice , shall you pursue , " declares the @entity56 16:20
justice means finding those responsible and punishing them to the full extent of the law
it also means tracking down anyone who enabled them by planning this operation or by hiding the perpetrators or helping them escape
if they acted on orders from the highest levels of @entity74 , as @entity3 prime minister @entity75 has said , they too should be held accountable
but justice also means not punishing those who were not responsible
measures that simply make more miserable the lives of the 1.7 million people who live in @entity81 and whose lives are already very tenuous should be avoided
the same applies for the 2.2 million people who live in the @entity9
@entity3 's government doubtless feels a need to provide a tough response , partly to re-establish a deterrence against such heinous acts , partly to satisfy the demands of its own grieving people
it should resist the temptation to act just for the sake of acting or from entering into a violent escalation with @entity74
@entity3 is justified in responding to rocket attacks from @entity81 but should avoid any offensive that would put millions of civilians , both @entity3 and @entity50 , in the firing line
the @entity3 army 's demolition of the family homes of two named suspects without any due process is an unwelcome return to a policy that @entity3 abandoned in 2005
as a deterrence , it has never succeeded in the past
it is simply a way of punishing people who happen to be related to suspected terrorists
worst of all would be to react as @entity3 has responded so many times in the past by announcing a massive new expansion of settlements
defense minister @entity119 has already suggested building a new settlement in memory of the teenagers
not only would this lose @entity3 the world 's sympathy , it would also weaken the @entity126 and @entity50 president @entity127 , who has been a welcome voice for reason and moderation and whose security forces have maintained cooperation with the @entity133 throughout the crisis
additionally , it would drive another stake into the heart of the two - state solution -- which remains the only sane and just way of resolving the @entity3 - @entity50 conflict
until that conflict is ended through negotiations , tragically we will see more horrific acts of violence and more martyrs on both sides
we are seeing some of the consequences of the collapse of secretary of state @entity150 's peace initiative in april
the absence of any movement toward peace has created a vacuum in which extremism can flourish
that 's why it is so important for the @entity158 not to walk away , but to remain engaged with both parties
this could be a decisive turning point for both @entity3 and @entity50
if @entity3 undertakes targeted measures designed to punish those responsible for this terrible crime , the world will be with it , and the crisis will be surmounted
if it turns its understandable anger into a general offensive , we could be in for a sustained period of violence claiming the lives of more innocent people on both sides
@entity37 , the finance minister , expressed the right policy : " we will find those responsible and we will punish them
the real revenge is our ability to bridge the gaps within us
" @entity3 pm at teens ' funeral : ' broad moral gulf ' between us , enemy the @entity3 teens killed : promising lives , grieving families
