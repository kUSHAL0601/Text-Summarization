@entity0 -- @entity3 's vice president arrived in @entity4 sunday to meet with leaders of the @entity7 nation , despite an @entity3 government order banning him from international travel
the visit of vice president @entity11 , who has been living in @entity12 since @entity3 authorities issued an arrest warrant for him on terrorism charges , drew sharp criticism from @entity3 prime minister @entity17
@entity19 countries should not host the wanted vice president , @entity17 said , according to @entity22 state television
@entity3 's @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 political leaders have squared off over an arrest warrant issued last year for the @entity25 vice president , who has denied the charged and called them " politically motivated
" the @entity31 has said @entity11 is banned from leaving the country
and @entity17 has demanded that @entity26 lawmakers hand over @entity11 , who refuses to return to @entity0 from northern @entity3
in an interview with @entity1 in january , @entity11 accused @entity17 -- a @entity24 -- of pushing the country toward a deep sectarian divide
on his trip to @entity4 , @entity11 was scheduled to meet with @entity4 's prime minister and emir " based on an invitation he had received earlier , " a statement from his office said
" the visit is expected to last a few days , and after that , the vice president will travel to other countries that will be announced later , " the statement said
" following the visits , the vice president will return to his place of residence in @entity51
" the vice president 's trip comes several days after @entity4 's foreign minister said his country had sent a low - ranking representative to last week 's @entity59 summit in @entity0 in order to send a message over " factionalism in @entity3 , " the state - run @entity52 reported
in february , @entity3 's top judicial committee accused @entity11 's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians between 2005 and 2011
@entity68 said the nine - judge council was under the control of the @entity24 - dominated central government and the allegations were " politically motivated
" the charges against @entity11 appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men , identified as the vice president 's security guards
@entity3 state - run tv aired video of the men 's confessions in december
@entity1 has not been able to verify their identities independently
@entity1 '' s @entity83 and @entity84 contributed to this report .
