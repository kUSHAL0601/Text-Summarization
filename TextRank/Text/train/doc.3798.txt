-- just when you think teen superstar @entity3 could n't possibly do anything dumber , he does something that makes you do a double face palm
@entity3 is truly achieving the impossible : he 's making @entity7 look good
so what did @entity3 do this time ? well , over the weekend he stopped at the @entity9 in @entity10
this museum is dedicated to preserving the memory of @entity13 , whose chronicle of her family 's efforts to hide from the @entity17 during @entity18 would later become " @entity19
" @entity3 ended his visit by writing in the @entity23 memorial 's guest book : " truly inspiring to come here
@entity13 was a great girl
hopefully she would have been a belieber
" for those who wonder what he 's talking about , a " belieber " is a term used to describe one of @entity3 's devoted fans
apparently @entity3 's take - away from visiting this @entity23 memorial was that he hoped that @entity13 would 've been a fan of his music
he may have just redefined the word " narcissistic
" there is a silver lining to this
some of his young fans tweeted that they had never heard of @entity13
consequently , the controversy surrounding his comments apparently raised awareness about the horrors of the @entity23 to some young people previously unfamiliar with it
and the @entity9 praised @entity3 's visit
but @entity3 really needs to stop talking for a while
and i do n't say that as someone who harbors an inappropriate amount of dislike for the teen singer
in fact , last may i wrote a piece for @entity0 defending and actually sympathizing with @entity3 when he had an altercation with the paparazzi
but that was almost a year ago
since then , @entity3 has become unbearable
in the last month alone , we have watched @entity3 caught on tape being restrained by his bodyguards as he unleashed a stream of obscenities and threatened members of the paparazzi with physical violence
he also allegedly spit in the face of one of his neighbors and threatened him after the neighbor complained that @entity3 was driving his @entity73 at 100 mph in their gated community
then we saw @entity3 storm out of his march birthday party like a spoiled child calling it the " worst birthday
" he went on to show up almost an hour late for his concert in @entity80
and in january , photos surfaced of @entity3 smoking what the website @entity83 said appeared to be weed with his friend rapper , @entity85
@entity3 wants the world to know he is n't a kid anymore
so he has decided to go the " bad ass " route
but @entity3 will never , ever be the tough guy he wants to be
why ? for starters , he 's @entity94
when you think @entity94 , you think nice , often overly polite people -- not thugs
second , @entity3 is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 130 pounds
those measurements say " horse jockey , " not scary guy
( sure , actor @entity101 is only 5 feet 4 inches tall and known as a tough guy , but @entity101 is @entity103 and was born in @entity104 , @entity105 , not @entity80 , @entity106
) @entity3 is clearly heading down the path of many child stars desperate to make the transformation into grown - up star
but his actions are not getting him there
instead , he is becoming a walking punch line
he has a few options
he could simply retire and enjoy his wealth
estimates are that he is worth more than $ 100 million
not bad for a 19 - year - old kid -- from @entity94
but it 's unlikely that @entity3 will take that route
the other option is to avoid the fate of past teen stars who have ended up behind bars or worse as they struggled toward adulthood
instead , he could follow the lead of another @entity3 : @entity126
he , too , was a young star
first on " the @entity128 " and then in the much better known boy band ' @entity127
@entity126 did n't try to be something he 's not
he continued to make music and then made a successful transition into acting
decision time is now for @entity3 : he can be a @entity126 or a cautionary tale that parents tell their kids who want to go into show business
what 's it going to be ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .
