@entity0 -- in a brief visit wednesday to @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity3 president @entity2 will join his two @entity8 counterparts to discuss environmental issues , security , driving economic growth through trade , and job creation
the @entity14 , which has come to be known as the " @entity16 " summit , began in 1992 with president @entity17
@entity2 and @entity19 prime minister @entity18 will visit @entity6 president @entity20
here are four issues among friends : 1
butterflies and oil : while the @entity27 pipeline continues to cause friction between the @entity3 and @entity19 , the monarch butterfly is a sore spot in @entity3 - @entity6 relations
monarchs migrate to their breeding grounds in @entity6 every year , but @entity6 farmers are using a harmful pesticide to kill pesky milkweed plants
@entity37 caterpillars depend on milkweed during their breeding season in @entity6
@entity18 is expected to continue pressuring @entity2 to approve the @entity27 , which would carry oil from @entity41 , @entity19 , to the @entity42
the two are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting during the one - day summit to focus heavily on environmental and trade issues
@entity19 cracks down on asylum - seekers : @entity20 's administration has complained loudly about @entity19 's imposing a mandatory visa rule specifically on @entity6 travelers in 2009 , facing a growing number of refugee cases where claims were denied
three nations expected to streamline procedures , data @entity18 has said he would like to see the rule lifted , but he says @entity19 has to reform its own backlogged refugee system first
the @entity6 government says the visa requirement is invasive and time - consuming , and blames it for a decline in the number of @entity6 visitors to @entity19
the @entity66 has urged the prime minister to lift the visa or simplify the process , making it similar to that of the @entity3
@entity20 and @entity18 signed an agreement on tuesday that will expand air travel between the two countries
@entity3 - @entity6 relationship strong but difficult : the relationship between the two countries goes beyond diplomacy -- there are commercial , cultural , and educational ties that account for more than $ 1.25 billion of trade and roughly 1 million legal border crossings each day
the @entity3 has deported more illegal immigrants under @entity2 than in any previous administration -- 370,000 in 2013 alone , according to @entity84 ( @entity84 )
border security continues to be a divisive issue with any kind of immigration reform legislation in the @entity3
not everyone 's happy with @entity90 : there are issues between @entity19 and @entity6 in in the 20 - year - old @entity90
@entity18 on tuesday called it " a very unbalanced relationship , " saying trade flow has tilted toward @entity6 and his government would like to bring it back into balance
midterm pressures weigh on ' @entity16 ' summit missing man 's family to @entity2 : while in @entity6 , please help us find @entity104
