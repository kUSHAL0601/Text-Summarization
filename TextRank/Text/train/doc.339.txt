@entity0 , @entity1 -- the security guard accused of assassinating the governor of @entity1 's @entity9 province was ordered into police custody for five days thursday , after a court hearing on his case had to be moved several times
@entity11 has been hailed as a hero in some quarters for gunning down gov. @entity14 , a liberal lawmaker who had spoken out against the country 's blasphemy laws , which make it a crime punishable by death to insult @entity21 , the @entity22 or the @entity23
" he had taken a very brave position on the blasphemy laws , " said @entity14 's sister - in - law , @entity24 , who noted that the governor had come under intense criticism from fundamentalists after suggesting that the capital punishment aspect of the law ought to be revisited
" i think the @entity32 will honor its commitment " to amend the law , she said
@entity11 's hearing in a @entity1 anti-terrorism court came hours after it was originally supposed to be held , and illustrated the power of hard - liners on @entity1 's streets to influence court proceedings
police had planned to bring the suspect to the court in @entity43 early thursday morning
but @entity11 's supporters -- conservative lawyers , madrasa students and others -- converged on the courthouse
many cheered him for shooting @entity14 , and for security reasons authorities changed plans and drove @entity11 to @entity0 in an armored vehicle , planning to hold the hearing in a makeshift court in a heavily secured area of the capital
there were three layers of security at that site , and media and onlookers were kept well back from the vehicle that carried @entity11
officials say judge @entity65 was asked to come to @entity0 to preside over the hearing
but the crowd of supporters in @entity43 prevented the judge from traveling to the capital , so police had to bring @entity11 back to @entity43 to hold his hearing there
officials say police had asked to keep @entity11 in custody for 12 days , but the judge granted five
investigators plan to continue interrogating the bodyguard
they 're trying to determine if he acted alone , or had outside help
on wednesday , authorities said that @entity11 was banned five months ago by a provincial police official from providing security to @entity80
the director inspector general of @entity82 said the guard had extremist views and it had been determined it was unsafe for him to guard important officials , said the @entity1 president 's special political adviser , @entity88
despite that assessment , the @entity82 employed @entity11 for security this week
the warning signs about @entity11 go back even further , said @entity93 , senior police official in @entity43
@entity1 intelligence agencies had warned officials in 2004 not to use @entity11 after they uncovered connections between him and the religious group @entity97 -- a @entity99 group that claims it has a closer connection to the @entity23 than other @entity101
@entity93 said @entity11 came from an area of @entity43 called @entity103 , adjacent to the capital , @entity0
he came from a poor family and his father is a laborer who built homes
@entity11 joined the police force in 2002 , and was selected for the elite force course in 2008 , four years after the warning from intelligence agencies , @entity93 said
@entity11 was one of 468 elite force guards in the @entity113 , which randomly assigns them as escorts to vips and officials like @entity14
@entity11 was assigned to the governor on tuesday
he had been his security guard many times before the shooting , according to @entity93 , who disputed the reported link to @entity97
@entity11 " killed the governor totally from his own beliefs regarding @entity23 , and no group was behind him , " @entity93 said
the shooting occurred at a market in @entity0
@entity11 confessed to assassinating @entity14 because " he did blasphemy of the @entity23 , " @entity125 , spokesman for @entity0 police , said tuesday
@entity11 told police @entity14 had described the blasphemy laws as " the black laws
" after the shooting , @entity11 immediately surrendered to authorities , the @entity133 of @entity1 reported , citing interior minister @entity134
dr. @entity135 , a spokesman for @entity136 , told @entity2 doctors counted 26 bullets in the governor 's body
a spotlight was put on @entity1 's controversial law in november when a @entity144 woman , @entity143 of @entity9 province , was sentenced to death for blasphemy
a court found the 45 - year - old woman guilty of defiling the name of the @entity23 during a 2009 argument with fellow @entity101 field workers
an investigation by a @entity1 government ministry found the charges against @entity143 stemmed from " religious and personal enmity " and recommended she be released
the government also said it would review the law
@entity14 said he would like to see the law " changed in such a way that it just basically says , if you insult any prophet , no matter who he is , that 's a criminal offense , but certainly not punishable by death
" @entity2 's @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .
