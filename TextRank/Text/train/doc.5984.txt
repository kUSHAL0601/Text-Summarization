@entity0 -- a furnace exploded monday at a nuclear site in @entity4 , killing one person and injuring four , a spokeswoman for @entity4 energy company @entity3 told @entity1
there was no radioactive leak or waste released , she said
the @entity4 nuclear safety agency also said there had been no radioactive leak
the explosion happened at a center for processing and decommissioning nuclear waste , said the safety agency , which is known by its @entity4 acronym @entity19
the agency has sent inspectors to the site , it said in a statement
the explosion took place in @entity28 , in southeastern @entity4 , the @entity3 spokeswoman said , declining to give her name in line with company policy
the building housing the furnace was not structurally damaged by the explosion , an official at the plant said
different activities take place at the large - scale site , including research by @entity4 's @entity41 , said a spokeswoman for @entity43 , a nuclear company that has operations at @entity28
@entity43 dismantles nuclear facilities at the site , she said
there are no nuclear power plants in @entity28 , the spokeswoman said , declining to give her name
weapons - grade plutonium was once produced at the site , one of the oldest nuclear facilities in the country , but @entity4 no longer produces plutonium
the location is not far from the @entity58 wine region
@entity59 of the @entity60 in the @entity61 said he does not know of any comparable facilities there , but he said the incident in @entity4 shows that processing even low - level nuclear waste carries some risk
the incident could affect the debate over what the @entity61 does with its spent nuclear fuel , said @entity59 of the nuclear watchdog group
currently , nuclear plants store the fuel in pools and in dry casks
some say that it should be processed for reuse , as is done in @entity4
but @entity59 said that reprocessing creates large amounts of low - level waste and that monday 's incident shows the risk of dealing with even that kind of waste
@entity4 relies heavily on nuclear power , which now accounts for about 80 % of the country 's electricity production , according to the @entity90
the @entity4 government has been reviewing the country 's dependence on nuclear energy after the nuclear disaster at @entity96 in @entity97 in march 2011 , which was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami
there have been no serious suggestions from mainstream politicians that @entity4 reduce its dependence on nuclear power , the @entity90 says
@entity1 's @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .
