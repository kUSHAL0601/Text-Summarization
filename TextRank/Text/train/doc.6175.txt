-- though the air traffic control system for @entity4 airspace has been restored after a technical failure , angry passengers forced to deal with long delays and other hassles reported scenes of disorganization and " disaster " as a result of interruptions to their travel plans
in @entity16 's @entity15 , which handles mostly @entity18 flights and from which many of the airport 's canceled flights were scheduled to take off , stranded passengers still stood in huge queues friday night
others sat in postures of dejection , some anxiously eyeing crowded power outlets as charges on their mobile phones began to fade
few airport or airline employees seemed to be offering information as would - be fliers waited for baggage drop , check - in and -- for those who had missed their flights or whose flights were canceled -- hotel rooms provided by @entity18
@entity39 , who arrived at the airport at 4 p.m. for a 6:20 p.m. flight to @entity41 , said because the airline had stopped taking baggage , he was n't able to board his flight because he had a suitcase
" they are so disorganized
... i had to sit and watch my flight take off just because there was no one available to take my luggage , " @entity39 told @entity0
" now i have no way to get out tonight because the queues are so long
" passengers needing to rebook flights were being asked to call a hotline , but several passengers told @entity0 they had to wait for extended periods on hold with little success
at @entity15 baggage claim -- hundreds of unclaimed bags sitting beside carousels -- a baggage handler told @entity0 that people have been leaving the airport without collecting their bags
" those people expect their bags to be delivered to their homes , " said the baggage handler
such had been the lengthy wait for checked luggage that many people seemed to have given up waiting
" it 's pot luck , you can wait five minutes to get your bag or five hours , " said baggage handler
uncharacteristically , several arriving flights were not immediately assigned carousels
information bottleneck a woman who asked to be called only " angry @entity18 passenger " was kept waiting in @entity81 for more than an hour and half to take off for @entity4
as a result , she missed her connection to @entity85 , and was livid because she paid $ 7,500 dollars for a business - class seat and " now i 'm being asked to queue in line with everyone else for a hotel
" " it 's a mess , it 's a disaster , " said the woman , adding that passengers were given little information
" the worst thing is , no one 's helping
" the reason for that , according to @entity99 , director - general of @entity101 - based @entity100 , may be because @entity16 officials might not know much more than the passengers themselves
" this is not an air traffic problem that originated at @entity16 , but in the en route environment , which makes it much more difficult to find out what 's happening , " @entity99 told @entity0
" although it 's happening to ( @entity16 ) and they 're dealing with it , it 's not their situation to fix , so the airport may not have that much information in terms of how long the situation is going to last , which is what passengers want to know
" they just deal with accepting ( the information ) and aircraft that are sent their way
" meanwhile , intercom announcements repeated at @entity16 stating that the " system is completely restored and we are working with all airlines to minimize the delays " were doing little to soothe frayed nerves of many passengers , with reports of flight delays of as long as six and a half hours
a @entity16 spokeswoman told @entity0 the airport could n't predict how long delays would last or what the impact into saturday might be
" at the moment , we 're trying to get as many people away ( friday night ) as we can , " the spokeswoman said
@entity0 's @entity143 also contributed to this report .
