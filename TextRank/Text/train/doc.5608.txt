-- @entity2 @entity1 are calling for the resignation of a @entity5 elected county judge who warned this week that the nation could descend into civil war if president @entity9 is re-elected
" it 's really up to judge ( tom ) head to do the right thing and resign and stop embarrassing @entity16 , " said @entity10 , who became the county @entity1 's chief monday
" i wish we were getting worldwide attention for something better than a crazy county judge , " @entity10 told @entity0
" but what are you going to do ? " there is no recall process for @entity14 's office in @entity2 , @entity10 said
the county 's @entity5 chief , @entity26 , accused the @entity1 of " opportunism " and said he had called @entity14 and left him a message offering " moral support
" " i do n't agree with him , but everyone has their opinion , " @entity26 said
" i can respectfully disagree with him and he can still be an elected official
" while @entity26 said he had not heard from state @entity5 chiefs , the @entity37 did weigh in with a statement
" this nonsense is what passes for mainstream in today 's @entity5 , " the statement said
" it 's not only ridiculous , it 's dangerous
it 's crystal clear that judge @entity14 should resign
" in remarks this week , @entity14 called for a well - equipped force to battle the @entity52 troops that he said @entity9 might bring in
the comments by @entity14 , who oversees emergency planning efforts , were broadcast by @entity0 affiliate @entity55
he made similar remarks on radio station @entity57 950
saying that as the county 's emergency management coordinator he has to " think about the very worst thing that can happen and prepare for that and hope and pray for the best , " @entity14 told radio host @entity62 that he believes " in this political climate and financial climate , what is the very worst thing that could happen right now ? @entity9 gets back in the @entity66
" why are tax hikes politically radioactive ? referring to unexplained " executive orders " and other documents that @entity9 and " his minions have filed , " @entity14 said , " regardless of whether the @entity76 take over the @entity77 , which i hope they do , he is going to make the @entity72 and he 's going to make the @entity73 irrelevant
he 's got his czars in place that do n't answer to anybody
" @entity9 , @entity14 said , will " try to give the sovereignty of the @entity82 away to the @entity52
what do you think the public 's going to do when that happens ? we are talking civil unrest , civil disobedience , possibly , possibly civil war
... i 'm not talking just talking riots here and there
i 'm talking @entity94 , @entity95 , take up arms , get rid of the dictator
ok , what do you think he is going to do when that happens ? he is going to call in the @entity52 troops , personnel carriers , tanks and whatever
" @entity14 vowed to personally stand " in front of their personnel carriers and say , ' you 're not coming in here
' and i 've asked the sheriff
i said , ' are you going to back me on this ? ' and he said , ' yeah , i 'm going to back you
' well , i do n't want a bunch of rookies back there who have no training and little equipment
i want seasoned veteran people who are trained that have got equipment
and even then , you know we may have two or three hundred deputies facing maybe a thousand @entity52 troops
we may have to call out the militia
" opinion : @entity127 headed our way sheriff @entity129 told @entity55 there had been no conversation about such a civil war scenario
the two have discussed contingencies for emergency management , he said
the lone @entity136 on the @entity137 , @entity138 , described @entity14 with a colorful @entity2 saying : " he 's a six - pack short of a full case of beer , if you know what i mean
" @entity55 reported that the warning was linked to taxes
head " indicates a tax increase is needed to shore up law enforcement to protect us , " the station reported , adding that a tax increase is under consideration that " would largely benefit the district attorney and sheriff 's offices
but the emphasis is more on salary competitiveness than doomsday scenarios
" @entity14 made his controversial remarks tuesday
on wednesday at a county commissioner meeting , he emphasized that his remarks were about " worst - case scenario in my opinion , " and added , " do i think those are going to happen ? probably not
" also wednesday , he told the @entity163 , " i can not divorce my theology and my philosophy from me , from my office , you know ? i am pro-life , i am pro-gun rights , and if you 're going to vote for me and say you do n't believe in gun rights , you do n't want me in office , so you wo n't vote for me
" attorney @entity172 jokingly put up @entity52 flags outside his @entity16 office , @entity55 reported
" when i saw the story i thought , once again , @entity16 is going to be the laughingstock of the entire nation , " @entity172 said
" what makes it so sad is he is our elected county judge , who is in charge of a multimillion - dollar budget
it 's like the light 's on , but no one is home
... i 'd just like to think he 's off his meds
" but video from the wednesday meeting showed at least one citizen supporting him
" judge @entity14 , thank you , and @entity67 bless , " the citizen said
@entity14 did not respond to e-mail or phone calls to his office on thursday
both @entity10 of the county @entity1 and @entity26 of the county @entity5 said they have received calls from people on both sides of the issue
while many callers to @entity10 have asked if there is any way to boot him from office , some have said they support the judge , @entity10 said
@entity26 said republicans are split over the issue
" there 's quite a divergent mix of views " within the party , he said
" some people are very staunch defenders of judge @entity14
and some people do n't appreciate how he said what he said
" @entity1 are pushing for members of the public to show up monday to a county commission budget meeting
" normally , nobody shows up , " @entity10 said
but given the attention @entity14 's remarks are getting , this meeting just might draw a crowd , he said
