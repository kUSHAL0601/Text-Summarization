-- @entity1 jolted out of bed at 3 in the morning
he was covered in sweat , his left arm was completely numb and his heart was pounding violently
he started crying because he was terrified of what was happening to him
that night in january 2010 was the third time in two weeks his sleep had been interrupted by heart attack - like symptoms , and he thought he knew why
" it 's sad to say , but i felt like i deserved this because i never took care of myself , " @entity1 says
he was 28 , weighed 460 pounds and wore size 6x clothing
he knew his habits of binge drinking , smoking two packs of cigarettes a day and overindulging in food were slowly killing him
" i asked @entity22 to give me another chance , " @entity1 says , " and i passed out
" the @entity25 native had been overweight since childhood
he was born into an @entity28 family where food was at the center of everything
his parents worked long hours , so his grandfather played a large role in raising him
in school , @entity1 was bullied because of his weight , and his grandfather was his only friend
but when @entity1 was 9 , his grandfather died
he turned to food to comfort the loneliness he felt
" @entity39 became a total escape , " he says
" i always considered it my drug
" the weight kept piling on through adolescence and beyond
at 18 , he started smoking
he began to drink heavily when he was 22
all the while he continued to eat unhealthy foods day and night
on his blog , i 've said it all before , @entity1 gives examples of some of his regular meals at the time
one included two burgers , a large soda , large @entity59 fries and chicken nuggets , totaling more than 2,400 calories
by 2010 , @entity1 was drinking up to 10 drinks in one night and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day
but after those scary symptoms kept waking him up , he made a pact with himself to change
" i quit smoking and stopped eating everything that was bad , " he says
@entity1 's parents bought him a treadmill because he was uncomfortable exercising in a gym
" that 's what really helped me the most -- being able to gain the physical and mental stability and work out on my own , " he recalls
he started by walking and slowly worked his way up to jogging and weightlifting
@entity1 overhauled his diet as well
he stopped eating fast food , fried food and red meat and drinking soda
he forced himself to get accustomed to healthy alternatives while allowing himself to indulge in small things so he would n't feel overwhelmed
he was motivated to change his eating habits by realizing how much time he would have to exercise to burn off the foods he was consuming
over the first couple of months , @entity1 dropped 50 pounds
the loss drove him to continue , and he set a goal of losing 200 pounds
when he had lost down to 305 pounds , @entity1 went through a difficult breakup and eased up on his calorie counting and exercising habits
six months later , he had gained back 40 pounds
scared he would continue gaining weight , he got back on the wagon
" i ended up being so angry at how bad i had gotten again , that i forced myself to get back on track , " he remembers
he began monitoring his caloric intake again and started exercising two hours a day , five days a week
as a reward for reaching his goal of a 200 - pound weight loss , @entity1 booked a trip to @entity103 to run up the steps of the @entity105 and re-create a famous scene from the movie " @entity108
" he was on course to hit his goal when a foot fracture sidelined him for a few weeks
when the trip to @entity103 approached , @entity1 had lost 185 pounds and was just shy of his goal
regardless , he decided to go and run up those stairs
@entity1 finally hit his goal weight of 260 pounds in october
he still wants to lose another 20 to 30 pounds , but his focus has moved toward challenging himself with new exercises
he 's also weightlifting to tone up some loose skin that has developed around his arms and stomach
through his journey , @entity1 has found support and motivation in his parents and girlfriend , @entity123
he says he still struggles to see himself in his slimmer body , and @entity123 pushes him to look on the bright side
" i 'm always going to be a positive voice for him to remember what a great thing he 's accomplished , " she says
" he inspires so many people
people see him , and they realize that they can do it , too
" @entity1 is using his experience to become a certified personal trainer
" my main desire is to help people like me -- people that are obese and feel hopeless about the situation , " he says
four years ago , @entity1 could not tie his shoes without losing his breath
a few weeks ago , he did a push - up for the first time
in two months , he hopes to be a certified personal trainer and well on his way to helping others reach their weight - loss goals .
