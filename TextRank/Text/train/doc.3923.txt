@entity0 -- a wave of bombings left 51 people dead and more than 120 wounded thursday in various @entity0 neighborhoods , including one in which angry residents later threw stones at security forces , the @entity2 said
at least 48 people were killed and 121 wounded when a parked car bomb detonated near a funeral tent in the predominantly @entity16 neighborhood of @entity17 in northwestern @entity0 , an @entity2 official said
after the @entity17 bombing , people threw rocks at security forces , the official told @entity1 , and some people fired guns
security forces withdrew until an @entity26 unit dispersed the crowds by shooting in the air and imposing a partial curfew in @entity17 , the official said
the gathering of the crowd reflects the growing frustration and anger against the government and security forces , especially by the country 's @entity16 , who have come under intensive attacks in recent days
@entity39 has witnessed in the past 10 days constant high - profile attacks , mainly targeting @entity16 and security forces , that have claimed the lives of more than 200 people
some 151 people were killed in the entire month of december
attacks on security forces in @entity47 and @entity48 were claimed by the @entity49 , an umbrella group that includes @entity50 in @entity39
there was no claim of responsibility for attacks on the @entity16
officials have blamed @entity50 and other @entity57 extremist groups of carrying out these attacks in an attempt to reignite the sectarian war that gripped @entity39 for years
many @entity39 blame their security forces for not preventing these attacks and question the abilities of these forces to secure the country , especially as the @entity67 military prepares for a complete troop withdrawal by the end of this year
many have blamed the deteriorating security situation on politicians still not agreeing on key security posts that remain vacant in the government formed more than a month ago
meanwhile , three people died in three other attacks in the @entity39 capital
a roadside bomb exploded next to a police patrol in southern @entity0 , killing a civilian and wounding seven people , including three police officers
in another attack in southeastern @entity0 , a roadside bomb exploded near a government convoy
it missed the convoy but killed one civilian and wounded three others
in central @entity0 , a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road , killing one civilian and wounding four
the blasts came after wednesday night 's assassination of three government employees by gunmen using pistols equipped with silencers in three neighborhoods in @entity0
two of the three government employees worked at @entity39 's @entity100 and the third employee worked at the @entity102 .
