-- " a must - have quality for figure skaters is , i think , gorgeousness
" @entity5 throws his head back and laughs , but he is serious
his is a sport where performance is everything -- from the flamboyant routines to the glitzy outfits to the interaction with the crowd
" the best part about figure skating is how i can have the entire audience 's attention to myself , " @entity15 's former world champion told @entity4 's @entity17 series
" i believe performing and showing off is very important , but i constantly prevent myself from becoming too self - absorbed
the audience wo n't be moved if i 'm performing only for my satisfaction
" it 's sort of like playing ' catch
' for me , when i 'm watching musicals or performances , i feel a bit uncomfortable when the actor is too self - absorbed
i like the people who can perform while being sensitive of the atmosphere
" @entity5 was raised to national hero status in 2010 when he became the first @entity15 man to win a world singles title in figure skating , having the previous month become the first to win an @entity38 medal in the discipline when he took bronze in @entity41
despite his success -- he also won silver at last year 's worlds -- the 27 - year - old admits he still looks up to his rivals
" i never thought i have anything special
i 've always thought about what i do n't have compared to other skaters , " he says
" i tend to think like other skaters get more applause than i do
i constantly think about ways i can level up , and i 'm often jealous of other skaters , " he adds , laughing
" when i see someone 's cool performance , it makes me want to be like them , and that 's what motivates me
" a big part of figure skating is the outfits -- often elaborate lycra creations that might otherwise seem more at home in a musical stage show
" i do n't have long legs and arms , and i am ... short , " quips @entity5
" so i want something that makes me look taller and with longer legs and arms
" i want something will make me a bit bigger , and so something with flaps that give my arms a little flow
" the shoes , with their thin blades , are even more important
" if i did n't have them , i would n't be able to skate , so it 's like the heart , " @entity5 says
" i think it 's something everyone struggles with , especially for me because my shoes do n't last long
i sometimes change them every month or after every competition , and it 's very difficult finding the right shoes
depending on if the shoes are good , it affects the performance , so it 's very important
" born in the city of @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity5 wanted to be a gymnast when he was growing up
but , as fate would have it , an ice rink was built near his home and his future was settled by the practical reality of it being closer than the gymnasium where he infrequently trained
" my mother 's co-worker , who really liked ice skating , took me and it made me realize that i really want to do this , " he recalls
" figure skating was n't famous where i grew up , and the ice rink was just built with a small club team without a professional coach , so the number of skaters was really small
but we all worked together to manage the money , learn tricks , and organize
" at junior high school he met @entity120 , who has remained his coach ever since -- she is currently working alongside the @entity123 @entity122 , who is now back on @entity5 's team after their initial split back in 2008
" we 've traveled the world together , which other coaches rarely do , " @entity5 says of @entity127
" now it 's officially a team , with a nutritionist , trainer , management company , costume maker , music mixer and level check managers , and choreographers
" @entity5 's success in 2010 was all the more satisfying because he had only just returned to full fitness after a serious knee injury that sidelined him for a year
the anterior cruciate ligament problem halted his progress after he won silver at the 2007 world championships -- another first for @entity15
" i 'm afraid of injuries
the surgery was good for my mental health , but it was about three years later when i was able to get back my flow , " he says
" as for balancing off - ice and on - ice life , right now i try not to because all of it is part of my private lifestyle
i 'll take breaks to rest my body , but i generally do n't feel like i must take days off
" @entity5 took more time out in 2011 when he had to have the bolt from that knee surgery removed , but he recovered the following year to win his first @entity161 -- which was held in @entity162 , the @entity123 resort city that will host next year 's @entity163
" the most significant competition for me is the @entity163
i 've entered the @entity163 twice , but the one at @entity41 is the one i ca n't forget about , " @entity5 says
" it was the season after recovering from my injury
it was a competition that i got so excited i started tearing up before it began , which never happened before
" i got hurt , and i struggled , took out my feelings on the people who supported me , and even then i was able to make the @entity163 , and through the season it was the only time when i felt like i was actually competing well
" it was n't the perfect performance , but it was my first medal , and i think that was when my life took a different turn
" @entity5 is now hoping to earn one of the three men 's places in @entity15 's figure skating team for @entity162 , though his chances were dented when he was forced to miss the defense of his @entity185 grand prix final title last week due to a leg injury
his 19 - year - old rival @entity187 defeated @entity189 's three - time world champion @entity188 to triumph in @entity190 , while @entity5 's replacement @entity192 was third
@entity5 , ranked third in the @entity185 standings , is now hoping to return to action at the @entity195 later this month , needing a strong showing to earn his place for the @entity163
" since three years ago when i decided to continue my career until @entity162 , i think emotionally i 'm doing everything i can to prepare for it , more than any other @entity163 ever , " he says
" i do n't have the @entity163 gold medal , so i definitely want it
