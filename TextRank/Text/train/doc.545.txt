@entity0 -- @entity3 director @entity2 on thursday defended harsh interrogation techniques as providing " useful " information to authorities , including in the raid that led to the death of @entity9
but he said it is " unknowable " what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques
" it is our considered view that the detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided information that was useful and was used in the ultimate operation to go against @entity9 , " @entity2 said
@entity2 's comments , in a rare news conference , come two days after a @entity23 panel released a blockbuster 528 - page report detailing " enhanced interrogation techniques " -- including mock executions , " rectal rehydration , " sleep deprivation and beatings -- in interrogations in the mid- 2000s
he admitted that some @entity3 officers ' actions were " not authorized , were abhorrent and rightly should be repudiated by all
and we fell short in holding some officers accountable for their mistakes
" @entity2 acknowledged that the agency sometimes exceeded its legal authority during interrogations of terrorism suspects
related : @entity3 feared for future of interrogation program , report shows he said detainees who faced " enhanced interrogation techniques " did provide some information that provided useful -- as well as other information that did n't
he said whether those interrogations had anything to do with that information is " unknowable
" " let me be clear : we have not concluded that it was the eits within that program that allowed us to obtain useful information from the detainees subjected to them , " he said
but he staunchly defended the agency during the 45 - minute news conference , adding : " @entity3 officers ' actions that did comport with the law and policy should neither be criticized nor conflated with the actions of the few who did not follow the guidance issued
" @entity2 opened his remarks with a vivid depiction of the events of the sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , and described the atmosphere going into fighting terrorism and collecting intelligence in the immediate aftermath of the attacks
" there were no easy answers , and whatever your views are on [ enhanced interrogation techniques ] , our nation and in particular this agency did a lot of things right during this difficult time to keep this country strong and secured , " @entity2 said
related : who is @entity2 ? @entity2 praised those who worked with him but he added the agency was " unprepared to conduct a detention and interrogation program , and our officers inadequately developed and monitored its initial activities
" @entity2 never used the word " torture " to describe the @entity3 's tactics
and he deflected a question about whether , in the interest of transparency , he supported the @entity101 's decision to release its report
" i think there 's been more than enough transparency that 's happened over the last couple days , " he said
" i think it 's over the top
" @entity2 said it 's " lamentable " that the @entity23 panel did n't conduct interviews with @entity3 agents -- a contrast , he said , with its handling of a report on @entity115 's lack of weapons of mass destruction , which included interviews with more than 200 officers
his strongest criticism of the report was with its contention that the @entity3 misled the public and government officials -- including then - president @entity125
that , @entity2 said , is untrue -- a stance former vice president @entity126 backed up in an interview with @entity129 on wednesday night
still , he did n't fault the report 's finding that the @entity3 's tactics were harsh and , at times , went beyond the legal authority @entity125 's @entity135 said the agency had
" many aspects of their conclusions are sound and consistent with our own prior findings , " @entity2 said
" over the years , internal agency reviews , including numerous investigations by our office of the inspector general , found fault in the @entity3 's running of the program
we have acknowledged these mistakes
" @entity2 was the @entity3 's deputy executive director while the tactics were being used
he said he had " some visibility " into what was happening , but that he was n't in the chain of command for that program , and did n't say whether he had made any effort to push for changes at the time
he also noted that the program for using " enhanced interrogation techniques " was ended in 2007
" in light of the fact that these techniques were banned seven years ago , however , my fervent hope is that we can put aside this debate and move on to issues that are relevant to our current national security challenges , " @entity2 said
meanwhile , one of @entity2 's sharpest critics , sen. @entity169 , the chairwoman of the committee behind the report , live - tweeted along with the press conference and sharply rebutted several points throughout his press conference
