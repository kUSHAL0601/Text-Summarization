-- an @entity3 businessman pleaded guilty thursday to strapping a fake bomb around an 18 - year - old girl 's neck in an attempt to extort money from her family , a court representative said
the guilty plea by @entity11 at @entity12 is the latest development in a case that grabbed the attention of the international news media last summer
@entity11 , who is in his 50s , was traced to the @entity18 and arrested in @entity19 , more than 9,000 miles from suburban @entity20 where the dramatic events took place in early august
he was extradited back to @entity3 in september
the authorities say @entity11 attempted to extort money from @entity11 's family in the suburb of @entity27 by fastening a black box around her neck
in a note , he said the box contained " powerful new technology plastic explosives " that would go off if @entity11 did not follow his instructions , according to a complaint for provisional arrest filed in @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity19
those instructions included orders to write to an e-mail address and wait for details on handing over an unspecified amount of money
@entity11 spent nearly 10 agonizing hours in her bedroom as the authorities tested the box to make sure it would not explode before removing it from her neck
at the same time , the authorities say , @entity11 was stopping off in his four - wheel - drive @entity48 at a library and video store to check the e-mail account he had given @entity11 and whiling away at least part of the time at a liquor store browsing for wine
@entity11 , who worked in investment banking and law , on thursday pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offense , a representative of the @entity64 @entity63 said
he will be sentenced later this month
investigators in @entity3 and the @entity18 say they linked @entity11 to the e-mail address using video surveillance and access logs , and found credit card records showing that he had purchased a thumb drive , lanyard and baseball bat identical to those used in the extortion attempt , according to the complaint
the document says he sauntered into @entity11 's room on august 3 , wearing a business shirt , slacks and a blue , yellow and white mask that covered everything but his mouth and a pair of " saggy and wrinkly " eyes
he was carrying a backpack and a black aluminum baseball bat
he said he was n't going to hurt her , then forced a black box around her neck using something like a bike chain and locked it , the complaint said
he attached a lanyard with a green thumb drive and a plastic document sleeve containing a note
" count to 200 , " he said , according to the complaint
" i 'll be back
" @entity11 waited a few minutes , called out to him but got no response
she contacted her parents and asked for the police
after nearly 10 hours , tests concluded that the device was not a bomb
@entity11 is a globe - trotting investment banker who went to primary school in @entity107 , attended college in @entity20 , ran investments in @entity110 and spent time in the @entity18 , where his ex-wife and three school - age children live , according to authorities and his attorney
@entity0 's @entity115 contributed to this report .
