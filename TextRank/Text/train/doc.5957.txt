@entity1 , @entity0 -- embattled president @entity3 said early saturday that he asked the country 's government to resign after thousands of angry @entity0 defied a government curfew and faced stinging police tear gas as they marched for change
" i asked the government to resign today and i will commission a new government to take over tomorrow , " @entity3 said in a national address on saturday shortly after midnight
as @entity3 spoke , @entity0 tanks rolled into the country 's major cities after the nation 's police force had been largely faced down by protesters on friday
demonstrators burned many police stations in @entity1 and @entity21 and overturned and torched police vehicles
@entity3 faces toughest challenge @entity25 president @entity24 spoke with the @entity0 president after @entity3 's address
" when president @entity3 addressed the @entity0 people tonight , he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity , " @entity24 said from the @entity28
" i just spoke to him after his speech , and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise , " @entity24 said in a televised appearance
" @entity41 will not address the grievances of the @entity0 people
suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away
" @entity45 : the man to lead a free @entity0 ? @entity3 gave no indication that he would step down or leave the country
" i assure you that i 'm working for the people and giving freedoms of opinion as long as you 're respecting the law , " he said
" there is very little line between freedom and chaos
" are you there ? send images , videos at the same time , @entity3 said that " these protests arose to express a legitimate demand for more democracy , need for a greater social safety net , and the improvement of living standards , fighting poverty and rampant corruption
" " i understand these legitimate demands of the people and i truly understand the depth of their worries and burdens and i will not part from them ever and i will work for them everyday , " he said
" but regardless of what problems we face , this does not justify violence or lawlessness
" @entity82 a senior @entity24 administration official , meanwhile , said friday evening that @entity3 's speech was " hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? " it 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that @entity3 believes he can ride this out , " and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption
" administration officials had hoped @entity3 would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said
the streets of downtown @entity1 appeared to calm somewhat overnight friday as the army -- a much more respected force than police among @entity0 civilians -- took control of the country
the army was much less aggressive with protesters than the police had been , and many @entity0 applauded the arrival of its tanks in @entity1 , @entity21 and elsewhere
one of the key questions ahead of sunrise in @entity0 on saturday is whether people will continue to welcome the army as a protective force or reject it as a tool of @entity3
celebratory crowds that had gathered overnight friday ahead of @entity3 's speech , expecting him to announce his resignation , quickly transformed into street demonstrations when the president announced he was staying put
the government cracked down throughout friday with thousands of riot and plainclothes police , later joined by army troops in tanks and armored personnel carriers equipped with gun turrets
@entity131 , people ran , screamed , hurled rocks and accosted walls of security as they tried to make their way to central @entity1
anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets in @entity0 since tuesday to demand an end to @entity3 's rule
the protests come weeks after similar disturbances sparked a revolution in @entity143 , forcing then - president @entity145 @entity144 to flee the country
both @entity0 and @entity143 have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years and accusations of corruption among the ruling elite
in downtown @entity1 , a calm seemed to be settling in overnight friday amid little sign of authority
" there is no authority ... there 's nobody to protest against , " @entity2 's @entity156 said , speaking of the capital 's downtown area
" state authority in much of downtown @entity1 has disappeared
" @entity3 imposed a nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. friday to 7 a.m. saturday
state - run @entity165 said the curfew was in response to the " hooliganism and lawlessness " of the protesters
vans packed with riot police circled @entity1 neighborhoods before the start of weekly prayers in the afternoon
later in the day , @entity0 soldiers moved onto the streets , the first time the army has been deployed to quell unrest since 1985
but protesters defied all warnings to demand an end to @entity3 's authoritarian 30 - year - rule
they chanted " @entity186 is great " and that the dictator must go
" @entity188 , @entity188 , @entity3 , " they shouted
plumes of rancid , thick smoke billowed over the @entity192 as , by nightfall , chaos reigned in the bustling metropolis
the headquarters of the ruling @entity196 was ablaze friday night
@entity165 said protesters ransacked the building and set it afire
police fired water cannons , rubber bullets and tear gas with force and impunity
a tourist on the balcony of his 18th floor hotel room told @entity2 he had to run in and wash his eyes and face from the stinging gas
police confiscated cameras from people , including guests at the @entity215
at least six people have died in the demonstrations this week , according to @entity0 's @entity218
but @entity165 reported friday that 13 have died and 75 were injured in @entity219 , south of @entity1 , citing medical sources as the government cracked down on protesters across @entity0 , opposition leader @entity45 , who returned home to @entity1 to join the demonstrations , was placed under house arrest , a high - level security source told @entity2
@entity45 , a @entity226 winner and former head of the @entity229 ' nuclear watchdog agency , was warned earlier not to leave a mosque near downtown @entity1 where he was attending friday prayers
@entity28 press secretary @entity232 said that the @entity25 is reviewing its aid to @entity0 " based on events now and in the coming days
" @entity25 secretary of state @entity235 addressed the @entity0 crisis friday , urging all parties to be peaceful and engage in dialogue
" we are deeply concerned about the use of violence by @entity0 police and security forces against protesters and we call on the @entity0 government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , " @entity239 said
" at the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully
" the protests sent ripples around the world , with stocks plunging on news of @entity0 unrest
the @entity257 dropped 166 points on friday , its largest loss since november
the @entity260 urged @entity25 to defer all non-essential travel to @entity0 and within the country
@entity263 said its last flight from @entity1 will depart saturday ; all other @entity1 service was indefinitely suspended , said spokeswoman @entity266
@entity267 and @entity268 will allow customers with tickets between friday and monday to or from @entity1 to change their flights at no charge , according @entity267 spokesman @entity273
@entity0 is the most populous nation in the @entity275 world and often a barometer for sentiment on the @entity275 community
" what happens in @entity0 will have an impact throughout the @entity275 world and the @entity285 , " said @entity279 , a former @entity25 ambassador to @entity280 and @entity281
in the @entity288 port city of @entity21 on friday , at least 1,000 protesters gathered and youths hurled rocks through black clouds of gas
crowds ran through the streets toward the city 's central square
there was no indication of a curfew in that city either , as people remained out well after the time it was to begin
in @entity219 , 15,000 riot police were out , using tear gas to disperse crowds , @entity165 said
riot police also confronted protesters in the cities and towns of @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 , according to the anti-government group @entity313
a @entity2 crew covering the clashes in @entity1 felt the wrath of the police
@entity2 's @entity156 and @entity318 were under an overpass and behind a column as police tried to hold back protesters
plainclothes police wielding clubs surrounded the @entity2 team and wanted " to haul us off , " @entity156 said
in a struggle , police grabbed @entity329 's camera , cracked its viewfinder , and confiscated it
@entity156 said the police threatened to beat them
@entity0 's @entity218 forbade protests friday , but some @entity0 went door to door in @entity1 , urging their neighbors to participate
the main opposition bloc , the @entity336 , urged its supporters for the first time to take to the streets
hours ahead of the protests , the internet went dark in many parts of the country
some text messaging and cell phone services appeared to be blocked
even though it was difficult to use @entity348 and @entity349 within @entity0 , thousands of others outside the country ran with the powerful social media tool to provide a real - time chronology of events
" @entity3 " was a trending topic
authorities arrested a prominent @entity336 leader early friday , detaining the party 's main speaker , @entity356 , according to a relative
other government critics voiced their opinions -- amazingly -- on state - run television
a popular morning show on state - run @entity165 included comments from guests calling for the resignation of government officials and increased dialogue between authorities and arrested protesters
the network carried coverage of the protests , even at times calling them large and peaceful
they followed days of unrest that have roiled several @entity275 countries
demonstrations in @entity143 were followed by protests in @entity380 , @entity0 , @entity381 and @entity382
" they all want the same , " said @entity383 of the @entity384 in the @entity285 , speaking of protesters in different @entity275 countries
" they 're all protesting about growing inequalities , they 're all protesting against growing nepotism
the top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer
" people are also fed up with authoritarian regimes that do not afford the people proper representation
@entity3 has not been seen in public for some time
he is 82 and there has been speculation of failing health
many @entity0 believe @entity3 is grooming his son , @entity402 , as his successor , a plan that could be complicated by demands for democracy
@entity2 's @entity407 , @entity408 , @entity409 , @entity410 and @entity411 contributed to this report .
