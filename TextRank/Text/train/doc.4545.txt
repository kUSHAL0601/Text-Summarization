-- @entity1 and @entity2 may be facing the most tense and delicate moment in their bilateral relationship since the 1989 @entity7 crackdown
the reported escape from house arrest of dissident lawyer @entity10 and his apparent flight to the @entity12 in @entity2 , while not yet officially confirmed , would greatly complicate the @entity15 administration 's efforts to keep relations on an even keel in a year already fraught with bilateral irritants
both leaderships want stability in the relationship , given the confluence of a @entity12 presidential election and the once - in - a - decade leadership transition in @entity2 scheduled for this fall
but this desire has been put to the test
there have been tiffs over @entity30 's early support for the @entity32 regime in @entity33 and @entity35 's failed satellite launch and presumed follow - on nuclear test
and there was the bungled attempt by the erstwhile security chief of a senior @entity30 @entity41 member to seek refuge in a @entity12 diplomatic facility on the eve of a visit to @entity1 by @entity30 's putative next leader
on many levels , the parallels to 1989 are striking
after the june 4 bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in @entity52 , another famous @entity30 dissident , @entity53 , became a living symbol of the bilateral conflict over human rights by spending a year in the @entity12 embassy before finally being allowed to leave the country
today 's top @entity30 leadership , though not yet as deeply divided as its 1989 antecedent , is struggling to maintain unity following the purge of one of its rising @entity41 stars for his connections to the security chief 's botched flight and lurid allegations of the murder of a @entity71 national
recent apparent leaks and counter-leaks to the @entity75 media detailing leadership infighting underscore the charged political atmosphere in @entity2 as party heavyweights jockey for advantage in the wake of the scandal
another wrinkle now is the absence of a revolutionary - credentialed paramount leader — manifest in the personage of @entity87 in 1989 — to arbitrate among the competing leadership constituencies
add to this cauldron the scheduled arrival in @entity2 next week of a @entity92 - level @entity12 delegation — led by secretary of state @entity93 and treasury secretary @entity94 — for the fourth round of the @entity96 ( @entity96 )
if @entity10 is holed up in the @entity12 embassy , it is hard to fathom how the two sides will stay focused on the many pressing geostrategic and economic challenges in the relationship -- especially as they will undoubtedly face a frenzy among accompanying media over @entity10 's status
moreover , the @entity30 leadership certainly will view the visit through the prism of another pivotal moment in the @entity7 drama , the state visit to @entity30 of then - @entity112 leader @entity111 , which emboldened the demonstrators and deepened divisions among the leadership
of course a game changer from 1989 , and one that seems to constantly surprise the @entity30 leadership , is the power of social media and the @entity119
despite a large contingent of foreign media in @entity2 to cover @entity111 's visit in 1989 , the regime still was largely able to pull the plug on the world 's ability to witness the ensuing massacre in real time
it is learning in recent weeks that such control is virtually impossible now
but this challenge can be a two - way street
if media accounts are accurate that @entity10 entered the @entity12 embassy on thursday evening , then @entity12 diplomats had less than 24 hours between his arrival and the story 's explosion on the @entity119
this hardly left sufficient time to seek instructions from @entity1 and to approach @entity30 officials about the possibility of orchestrating a face - saving way to end the potential standoff
the problem is made worse by the likelihood that many in the @entity30 elite will assume the @entity149 deliberately leaked the information to embarrass the @entity30 government on the eve of the @entity96
the @entity154 's liberal wing also is trying to exploit the downfall of its @entity41 archenemy to revive its long - diminished fortunes and push for a new wave of economic and political change
their hard - line opponents , however , will see an opportunity in the @entity10 affair to blunt any reformist tide
coming on the same day the @entity165 will have tweaked @entity2 's neuralgia about @entity167 by advising @entity168 that it will take a second look at potential sales of new fighter aircraft to the island
the news about @entity10 completes the circle for those eager to paint the @entity149 as bent on stifling @entity30 's rise
in the past , such cries of " hostile foreign forces " meddling in @entity30 's internal affairs frequently have taken the wind out of the reformists ' sail
against this backdrop , the stage is set for a sudden increase in bilateral tension
initially presumed to be largely inconsequential , next week 's @entity96 meetings may prove the most critical test of @entity12 - @entity30 relations the @entity15 administration has faced to date
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .
