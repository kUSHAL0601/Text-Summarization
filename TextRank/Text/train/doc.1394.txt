for many people , any interest in the resurgence in @entity3 volcanic activity this year is now a distant memory
however , an eruption from @entity7 that began on august 31 continues to this day and has now emitted the most lava of any volcano in @entity3 since 1947 and shows no sign of stopping
to give some sense of the scale , the volcano has now spewed so much lava to the surface that it would fill @entity18 stadium to the brim more than 500 times over
and the total area of impact is over 28 square miles
unlike a lava flow that is currently destroying homes in @entity25 , however , the lava in @entity3 is flowing in an uninhabited area and has only provided stunning visual effects that have been captured by many photographers
however , toxic gas released is causing respiratory discomfort to people in nearby towns , and has even triggered pollution warnings in other countries , including @entity35 , and measurable pollution peaks in the @entity37
so far , however , the eruption has not caused any problems from ash clouds because it is erupting beyond the ice cap
however , this could change at any time
the caldera at the top of the volcano is dropping every day , as magma flows out from below
this is being monitored by a high - precision gps instrument placed there by gutsy scientists of the @entity51
the subsidence is not smooth , but lurches down in jumps coinciding with earthquakes occurring beneath the surface
this subsidence marks a slow collapse of the caldera , a process that often ends with an eruption
there are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera , so any eruption would lead to the production of ash , once it melts its way through the ice cap ; melting ice interacts with the magma , turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash
if this occurs , the eruption may well affect some flights
it would also cause destructive flooding from melting of the ice
however , we should not see any repeat of the massive airspace closure in @entity83 in 2010 , the biggest since @entity84 , following the eruption of the @entity86
that eruption stranded millions of travellers and cost the industry a massive sum
one key difference between then and now is that there is no longer an aviation " zero tolerance " policy to ash
this means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations , and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 @entity83 institutes called @entity104 , mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010
moreover , the ash produced in 2010 was especially fine , allowing it to stay aloft for a long time
the weather at the time also conspired against civil air authorities and travellers , with dry air and consistent northerly winds causing the ash to spread deep into @entity83
to be sure , there is a small chance of a much more significant eruption
@entity7 has had huge eruptions in the past , bigger even than the 1783 - 84 @entity118 eruption that led to a long - lived fog over much of @entity83 , which contributed to extreme low winter temperatures and many deaths
however , the frequency of such large eruptions is low -- separated by hundreds of years on average
that said , the timing of the next big one may have been brought forward by the shrinking of the ice caps due to climate change
the associated reduction of pressure in the mantle beneath the crust has caused magma generation rates to approximately double over the last century
but the picture here is not 100 % clear cut as the altered stress state of the crust may mean that more magma freezes beneath the ground , rather than erupting
even without a huge eruption , threats remain from the continued possibility of large floods from meltwater , with potential risk to human life
the highlands north of the @entity151 glacier therefore remain closed to the general public
taken overall , there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in @entity3 that may well impact some flights
however , despite all the risks , it is still unlikely we will witness a repeat of the travel chaos that brought @entity83 airspace to a standstill in 2010 .
