-- months after his first trial ended in a hung jury , @entity1 was convicted monday by a @entity5 jury of first - degree murder in the beating death of his pregnant wife
@entity9 was discovered dead in 2006 in the bedroom of her @entity12 home
her husband , @entity13 , first went on trial last june but a jury could not unanimously agree on a verdict
but that was not the case monday , when several of @entity9 's relatives embraced and wiped away tears after this jury 's decision was announced
afterward , judge @entity23 said he had no reason to set aside the verdict and ordered @entity1 to be sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole
according to @entity23 , @entity9 " was n't just murdered , she suffered a beating the likes of which we seldom see
" @entity1 , now 37 , struck her over 30 times , seemingly only stopping after " he was exhausted , " said the judge
" the evidence suggests that the assailant was overcome completely by anger and rage , " the judge added
" and even then , he had the energy to strip her of her engagement and weddings rings because , in his mind , she was unworthy of wearing them
" saying the " fingerprints of domestic violence are all over this case , " @entity23 said @entity1 " had not only a motive " to kill his wife " but the circumstances pointed directly to him
" @entity52 , the victim 's sister , said she answered a call from @entity1 requesting that she drop by his home to pick up some computer printouts that " were said to have been ... a belated anniversary gift , " according to a search warrant
after entering the @entity12 home on november 3 , 2006 , @entity52 found her bloodied sister dead on her bedroom floor as well as the victim 's daughter alive on the other side of the bedroom
the defense contended @entity1 first learned about his wife 's death later that day at his mother 's home in @entity71 , @entity5 , and was contacted by an investigator as he was heading back to @entity12
another search warrant said that @entity1 hung up on a phone call from a detective , and , " he refused to come to the scene or to continue speaking with investigators
mr. @entity1 did not inquire as to his daughter 's well - being or to the nature and / or cause of his wife 's death
" the defense had argued that intruders , and not the defendant , had killed @entity9
they pointed to what they described as holes in the prosecution 's case -- including the lack of blood in @entity1 's car and on the jeans he supposedly wore the night his wife died
" there may have been two killers in the house
but neither of them was @entity1 , " argued defense attorney @entity99
" this case is awful , it 's sad , it 's heavy , it weighs on you
and yet that has nothing to do with who killed her
" @entity111 assistant district attorney @entity110 , meanwhile , said @entity9 died as a result was a purposeful killing and not a violent theft
" this is not a stranger crime , " the prosecutor said
" this is an act of domestic violence that had been coming on
