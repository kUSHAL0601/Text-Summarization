@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 , the @entity4 's fastest growing economy , wants to become a member of the eurozone -- but its finance minister says the country will wait until " it is safe to do so
" " we want to join ( the eurozone ) , " @entity10 told @entity2
" i think we feel that there is still a lot to be done and the eurozone has a lot of homework to do
" the minister says the eurozone must be " repaired " and that there is more work to be done
" we are very concerned , we think half the job has been done , but we are still not entirely out of the woods , " he said
he says at the moment there is no real safety net when problems arise in the eurozone and there needs to be fewer restrictions on the @entity31 , for example when it comes to buying government bonds
" we feel that the so - called firewall is inadequately large and we feel that the freedom of action that the @entity31 thinks it has is inadequate , " he added
but despite the difficult economic climate engulfing much of @entity40 , @entity1 's economy is continuing to grow
according to @entity10 , between 2008 and 2011 @entity1 achieved a cumulative growth of almost 16 % -- double that of the @entity4 's second fastest growing economy , @entity43
regardless of @entity1 's growth , the country is enacting a policy of austerity
@entity10 sees this as the most important part of the country 's fiscal policy
he says @entity1 will reduce the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product this year , and is almost certain that they will eliminate " excessive " public debt
the finance minister believes his country is well placed should the eurozone 's economic prospects improve , or even if they weaken , saying that scenario helps @entity1 's export performance
" we are fairly comfortable with both situations , " @entity10 said
" i am not too concerned one way or another
