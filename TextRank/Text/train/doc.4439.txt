editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- throughout the 1990s , @entity20 's @entity19 contained about 8,000 of @entity22 's most violent criminals
better known as @entity24 , it was once the largest prison on the continent
on october 2 , 1992 , a massive fight broke out in the @entity29 complex among the prisoners
it ultimately resulted in 111 inmate deaths
that day , there were 84 state military police officers present , and 102 bullets were fired
the nine guys who were n't shot in their vital organs got knifed , but the cops ( none of whom were killed , by the way ) swore that the prisoners were already carved up by the time guards arrived
in the archival images we collected , we see one inmate partially decapitated and another with a hole in his chest the size of a tennis ball
that does n't exactly scream self - defense
( the footage is graphic , so be warned
) see the rest of @entity24 's @entity55 at @entity9 ronaldo @entity56 worked at the prison for over a decade
he was also one of the first people to witness the aftermath of the carnage that 's now referred to as the @entity61
after the jail 's destruction , @entity56 transferred to a minimum - security prison in @entity65
he brought more than his experience to the new job
he also took along some of the only surviving evidence of the massacre : more than 2,000 photos , 300 personal effects and 10 hours of grisly video footage
it was all taken shortly after the violence subsided , and he wants to be sure that history does n't forget what he witnessed
so we asked him to help us understand
