-- @entity1 had already reached @entity2 1 on @entity3 when he heard the loud and chilling bang of the avalanche
he knew his father was behind him on the @entity7 and ran down the mountain , only to find the devastation of ice , snow and baggage scattered everywhere
" i thought he abandoned his load and ran to safety , " he tells me , almost whispering
" but i could not find him amid the commotion at base camp
then i saw the helicopters , with the bodies on the suspended ropes , and i knew i lost my dad
" @entity25 's body was taken to @entity26 , a tourist town where most who embark on a trip to @entity30 start out
from there , @entity31 and his brother carried him home themselves on foot , a trek that took seven hours along the mountain trail
@entity37 land of few opportunities @entity25 , 57 , was a high altitude cook
for the past 15 years , during the climbing season , he spent one month at @entity30 and one month at @entity2 , at 6,100 meters
two months to earn $ 1,500 , meant to last the year
@entity25 was famous for always showing happiness
climbers who knew him remember him as a funny man , laughing and joking all the time , never angry , always kind
his son @entity47 , 37 , lives with the family in @entity49 , a small village of 50 souls located in the @entity51 in the @entity7 , where the country 's greatest ethnic sherpa climbers live , well off the beaten track of @entity57 's @entity30 trail
the @entity51 suffered the biggest loss of life from april 's @entity3 tragedy that killed 13 guides ( another three are still missing and presumed dead ) , the deadliest accident in the history of the world 's highest peak
here , every man , if not in school or too old , is involved in climbing expeditions
they have few other choices
@entity72 grows but the odd patch of potatoes
few tourists pass by and yak herding is an insufficient way to make a living
cut off from the economic tourism opportunities that the rest of @entity57 's @entity82 region enjoys , uncontaminated by progress , the @entity51 retains the atmosphere of ancient @entity85 -- which for centuries nurtured the @entity88 utopian dream that a secret land of happiness may exist somewhere among the impenetrable snow - capped mountains
the villages are marked by the vernacular architecture of slate - roofed houses
traders still cross the perilous high passes into @entity98 with their cargo of salt and wool as they 've done since ancient times
there 's an abundance of pagodas , monasteries , stone walls carved with mantras , wheels containing prayer scrolls and sacred shrines
thousands of colorful flags flutter in clusters , offering prayers to be carried along by the wind
@entity3 avalanche : @entity118 climber recounts how @entity1 saved his life a time to earn merit , not mourn in @entity25 's home , feelings of sadness are eclipsed by spiritual duty
" @entity130 now are the puja , " says @entity125 , his widow , referring to a series of prayers and rituals
her focus is on directing special prayers aimed at purifying and earning merit for @entity25 's spirit
nothing else holds relevance for her -- not the political demands of the @entity138 , nor the discussions raging on social media worldwide , nor whether someone will climb @entity3 from the @entity57 side of the mountain this year
she 's silencing her mourning and sorrow to give all of herself for the benefit of @entity147
the sherpa follow one of the @entity151 sects of @entity152 , @entity153 , and believe that 49 days after @entity25 's death , his next life is determined and he may reborn
she says accidental deaths are a bad way to go
it means @entity25 's consciousness was in confusion when he died , and that affects his afterlife and rebirth
the more people involved in the prayers , the better the chances of a superior reincarnation
@entity125 and @entity25 's private quarters have been transformed into a prayer room , and we all sleep together on the floor of the main hall
early in the morning , @entity125 and i plan to go to the three isolated monasteries of @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , located high on the steep hills above @entity180
immersed in nature , they 're a retreat for ascetics and much revered by local communities
on the kitchen table are several kilograms of rice , three bottles of @entity189 , a few pats of butter and sugar
her son , @entity47 , has already left for @entity195 to meet the management of the company his father worked for to discuss what support they can offer
" you are my porter , " @entity125 says , bursting into a laugh , and i 'm glad that she finds my presence amusing
high cost of devotion @entity125 climbs the yak trails with determination , stopping every few minutes to catch her breath
we pass through forests of juniper , continuously climbing until we reach the clouds and the monasteries hidden in them
at each gompa ( monastery ) , the same ritual takes place
the lama ( priest ) offers us butter or milk tea and food
we politely decline , but the lama insists and we accept
we barely empty half of our bowls when the lama comes to fill them again
we decline , he insists , we accept again
then @entity125 offers money for the lama to perform the puja
the lama declines , she insists , he accepts
this display of generosity is a fundamental aspect that governs the relationship of the @entity138
next , @entity125 prepares a copper plate full of rice , the equivalent of $ 30 , and a ceremonial white scarf that the lama will use for the prayers
we pay our respects in the monastery 's prayer room
before leaving , the lama puts the ceremonial scarf around @entity125 's neck
it 's an emotional moment , the only time @entity125 lets her emotions overtake her
she cries , holding the hands of the lama , abandoning herself in his support
after six or seven bowls of noodles and a dozen teas , we head back home
@entity125 's face is relaxed
she 's carried out important deeds for her husband
but today was just a small part of the funeral rites
@entity125 also sends bags with salt , butter , rice and money to 500 families in the valley , so they 'll recite prayers for @entity25
she says she sent similar bags to many monasteries in the @entity82 and in special holy places as far as @entity276
the cost of such devotion is high
to confirm a day of puja in a large monastery costs $ 1,300
the total expenditure will be upward of $ 10,000 , significantly more than the life insurance that the government pledged after many protests by the @entity285
@entity125 says she had to ask for a loan at the market at an interest rate of 25 % per year -- she does n't have the collateral to borrow from banks
climbers head home as @entity138 refuse to work " i wonder if i will come back alive ? " although the world regards them as high altitude guides and porters , most sherpas do n't want to be mountain climbers on @entity3
better jobs are available for many in the other valleys of the @entity302 that cater to trekking tourists
but here in the @entity51 , there are n't many options
" every time i go on a climbing expedition , i wonder if i will come back alive , " says @entity47
" i feel sad , but i have to do this job for my family
i 've summited @entity3 14 times and i 've always brought a photograph of my family with me
" though more catastrophic than usual , this year 's tragedy was no great surprise for those in the @entity51 , who have become familiar the loss of life that almost always occurs in april and may
the only difference , @entity47 tells me , is that " this year was particularly unlucky
" the @entity285 ' approach to religion includes an animist tradition that holds that mountains and other natural features are the abodes of deities that can make men suffer if they fail to respect them
i offer a puja in the monastery for @entity25 in the afternoon and ask @entity332 , a young monk who says he escaped from @entity98 , the reason behind the bad luck
" i do n't know if the god of the moun
