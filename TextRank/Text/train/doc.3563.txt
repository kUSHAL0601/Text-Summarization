comedian @entity2 died of " therapeutic complications " during a procedure to evaluate her " voice changes " and stomach reflux , the @entity1 medical examiner said thursday
" the classification of a death as a therapeutic complication means that the death resulted from a predictable complication of medical therapy , " the report said
@entity14 , 81 , died september 4 , a week after an appointment at @entity18 's @entity17 clinic
the medical examiner 's investigation ruled that the cause of death was " anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest , " a medical description of brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen
the arrest happened " during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation for evaluation of voice changes and gastroesophageal reflux disease , " the medical examiner 's officer said
the complication in this case was laryngospasm -- a spasm of the vocal cords that makes it difficult to breathe , pathologist and surgeon @entity44 told @entity45
the situation was compounded when @entity14 went into cardiac arrest
" she stopped breathing and her heart went into arrhythmia because there was n't sufficient oxygen to maintain the heart muscle , " said @entity44 , who was not involved in @entity14 ' autopsy
" the pump , the heart itself , was unable to move fresh oxygenated blood upstream to the brain
" at first , @entity44 said , @entity14 was unable to bring oxygen into her body due to the vocal cord spasm
after a couple of minutes , her heart started to beat irregularly or completely stopped
finally , her heart stopped delivering fresh oxygenated blood to her brain , which shut down , according to @entity44
" the unanswered question is why they did not do a combat ( tracheotomy ) ? " he asked
" you 've seen in the @entity73 movies
you take a ballpoint pen and puncture the thyroid cartilage and create an emergency airway for her
of course , they would do it with sterile instruments
... and , after minute two , did anybody say , we need to start doing some cpr for her ? " the initial report did not name the doctor or doctors who performed the procedures
@entity88 posted this on @entity90 on friday afternoon : " in response to @entity1 's medical examiner 's report , we continue to be saddened by our tragic loss
no further comment at this time
" timeline emerges in @entity2 ' death what happened ? several clinic workers told investigators that the august 28 appointment began with @entity14 ' personal throat doctor , dr. @entity105 , performing a laryngoscopy , which involves using a device to view a patient 's vocal folds , a source close to the investigation told @entity45 last month
@entity111 dr. @entity110 , who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning after @entity14 ' death , then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness , the source said
@entity110 detected something of concern , the source said
@entity105 then began a second laryngoscopy to again view @entity14 's vocal cords , the source said
it was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell , leading to a cutoff of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest , according to the source
@entity105 was authorized only to observe @entity110 , who performed the procedure , since she was not certified by @entity17 clinic , as required by @entity1 health law , the source said
investigators have found no prior consent form signed by @entity14 authorizing a procedure by @entity105 , the source said
it was unclear if @entity14 had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated
but @entity105 denied " performing an unauthorized procedure " before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest , a source close to the doctor told @entity45 last month
paramedics rushed @entity14 from the clinic to @entity1 's @entity144 a mile away , where she was kept on life support until she died a week later
