territorial tensions between @entity1 and @entity2 have flared after a close encounter between their military jets in disputed airspace over the @entity6
the neighboring rivals accused each other of potentially triggering a dangerous incident , after two pairs of @entity1 fighter jets were scrambled and flew unprecedentedly close to a @entity15 @entity14 - @entity13 surveillance plane and a @entity17 electronic intelligence aircraft saturday
the fly - bys occurred in airspace claimed by both countries as part of their " air defense identification zones , " while @entity1 carried out joint maritime exercises with @entity25 at the weekend
@entity2 claims the flights were part of a routine reconnaissance mission near a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both nations , known as @entity32 in @entity1 and @entity32 in @entity2
meanwhile , @entity1 's @entity33 described the move as a justified enforcement of the country 's air defense zone
@entity15 defense minister @entity38 said it was the closest that @entity1 jets had come to @entity15 aircraft -- passing about 30 meters from one plane and 50 meters from another
" we believe this proximity and behavior does not follow common sense , " he said
he said the flight crews reported the @entity1 planes were armed with missiles
" the crews were on edge as they responded
" chief cabinet secretary @entity53 told reporters monday that @entity2 had lodged a protest to @entity1 through diplomatic channels over the incident
" this should never happen , " he said
beyond meeting the @entity15 aircraft , the @entity1 jets took no further action , and the @entity15 pilots returned to base

according to the statement , carried by @entity1 state media , the ministry had since lodged a complaint with @entity2 and called on it to " stop all surveillance and interference activities
" " otherwise , all the consequences that might be caused will be borne by the @entity15 side , " read the statement
tensions in recent years over @entity1 's increasingly assertive stance towards territorial claims escalated in november when it unilaterally declared an " air defense identification zone , " or @entity85 , that included stretches of disputed territory
an @entity85 is essentially a buffer zone outside a country 's sovereign airspace , in which nations request that approaching aircraft identify themselves
the @entity94 and @entity2 have both declared such zones around their territories
both countries immediately challenged @entity1 's declaration of its @entity85 in november , with the @entity94 sending two unarmed b - 52 bombers through the airspace without notifying @entity1 authorities
the disputed island standoff regularly sees the coast guards of @entity1 and @entity2 tail each other around the island chain
while the islands are uninhabited , their ownership would allow for exclusive oil , mineral , and fishing rights in surrounding waters , and their status has been a regular flashpoint in @entity15 relations
near miss between jets at @entity119 airport planes nearly collide off @entity121 @entity122 , jetliner nearly collided over @entity124
