-- two teens who , in separate incidents , threatened to carry out similar attacks as the massacre in @entity5 were promptly arrested this week -- a sign that law enforcement officials have taken an aggressive no - tolerance approach against potential copycats
in @entity11 , @entity10 posted messages online that he " both supported the actions of the school shooter in @entity19 and had thought of possibly committing similar acts , " police in the city of @entity15 said
police learned of the statements about 9 a.m. monday
by monday afternoon , detectives had tracked them down to the 18 - year - old in the northern @entity11 city of @entity27
@entity10 was arrested and faces felony charges of criminal threats , police said
" several items were seized from the residence in an effort to both complete the criminal investigation and to prevent any future acts of violence by @entity38 , " a police statement said
in the second case , police in @entity40 arrested @entity42 , 19 , after he allegedly posted threatening messages on @entity44
@entity42 , in a post sunday , wrote : " feel like going on a rampage , kinda like the shooting where that one guy killed some teachers and a bunch of students , " @entity0 affiliate @entity45 reported
he was arrested the same day and charged with terrorism , harassment through the @entity55 and possession of drug paraphernalia , the affiliate reported
in school shootings , patterns and warning signs the arrests come after investigators in the @entity19 elementary school shooting issued stern warnings to potential copycats
last week , @entity19 state police lt. j. @entity66 warned that threats would be " investigated statewide and federally and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified
" however , such arrests may prove difficult to prosecute , legal experts say
" this country is based on freedom of speech , " said @entity74 , a law professor with the @entity75
" saying things about the @entity19 shooting somewhat in a threatening manner , that is not going to be actionable , for the most part
" but , he added , " if you intentionally interfere with an investigation , mislead officers trying to conduct an investigation on purpose , well then , yes absolutely , you 're going to be prosecuted
" there may be another way to prosecute suspects but that also raises issues , said @entity74
" another is where you intentionally create a public panic , " he said
" but understand what the prosecution would have to show is the post or the tweet was done intentionally , was done on purpose , in order to interfere with the investigation in order to create a public panic and that is a relatively high bar to show
" strangers inspired to honor @entity5 victims @entity0 's @entity107 and @entity108 contributed to this report .
