-- @entity3 's @entity2 show " @entity8 " represents the reality of working in television news about as accurately as " @entity6 " captured working in politics -- which is to say , not at all
but both dramas did something more worthwhile : they expressed the idealism that should animate these careers
and in this time of creative destruction throughout the news industry , it 's more important than ever before
that 's why " @entity8 " matters
when " @entity6 " debuted in 1999 , the political arena was suffering from a well - deserved dose of @entity21 cynicism
the smart kids were all making piles of money on @entity25 by surfing the tech bubble , and with the 2000 election looming between @entity28 and @entity29 , the status quo of peace and prosperity seemed boring
but " @entity6 's " alternate reality -- with a @entity39 helmed by a flinty , @entity42 - born @entity41 - winning economist named @entity43 -- offered a glimpse into a less gray world , where the dialogue was as sharp as the sense of patriotic purpose
and through at least the first four seasons , written primarily by the show 's creator @entity3 , no matter which party you belonged to , once a week the show reminded you why you cared about politics in the first place
more than a dozen years later , " @entity8 " debuted on @entity2 ( which , by the way , is owned by @entity52 , @entity0 's parent company )
expectations were high , but the unremitting earnestness of the first season could be off - putting -- especially to journalists -- and made shrugging off the show more fashionable than saying you were a fan
but here 's the thing : @entity3 with a few miles per hour off his fastball is still better than almost anything else on television
despite the critics , the show 's lead character , @entity64 , quickly made an imprint on civic debates via social media , even if only as a peripheral fantasy about how the news could be
played by @entity72 , @entity64 is on a self - styled " mission to civilize , " and for all the @entity74 - meets - @entity76 posturing , his message was refreshing amid the high - water mark of hyperpartisan cheerleading that passed for much of cable news between the @entity82 wave of 2010 and the 2012 presidential election
@entity64 's fictitious prime - time show , " @entity85 , " is revived by dedication to the idea in this quote usually attributed to sen. @entity89 : " every one is entitled his own opinion , but not his own facts
" @entity3 is often accused of writing " liberal fantasies " -- a chorus president @entity95 joined with a gentle jab at the @entity98 dinner
but @entity64 's character is bearded a bit by making him a @entity102 @entity101 , who graduated from the district attorney 's office in @entity106 to serve as a speechwriter to the first president @entity28 before entering the tv fray
his politics are old - school " i like ike " main street republican , which is to say centrist in the current environment
@entity64 is quick to criticize liberals for their losing ways and the yippie - fueled unhinged extremism in the late ' 60s that caused the left to lose credibility for decades
but @entity64 's hottest criticism is reserved for the rise of right - wing radicalism , as in this famous diatribe : " ideological purity
a fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism
a hostile fear of progress
a need to control women 's bodies
pathological hatred of the @entity143 government
they can call themselves the tea party
they can call themselves conservatives
and they can even call themselves @entity101 , though @entity101 certainly should n't
but we should call them what they are -- the @entity143 @entity155
" this intemperate , unvarnished surgical strike drew criticisms of the show in real - world media as well as a congressional condemnation in the show 's fictional universe
but @entity64 does not mistake the goal of nonpartisanship for neutrality
perhaps the biggest narrative risk of the show is its location in the recent past
the first season began with the @entity172 oil spill and hit heights with the shooting of @entity175 and the midterm elections
the second season started in the summer of 2011 , with the @entity101 presidential primaries , and already extends to the outburst of @entity180 in the early fall
this dynamic indulges a bit of instant nostalgia but also , as @entity3 explained on " @entity186 , " it allows the viewers to know more than the characters -- a neat trick
this kind of transference gave rise to perhaps the most interesting aspect of the show
between the seasons , the character of @entity64 waded into online political debates via @entity198 -- courtesy not of an enterprising pr firm , but of an otherwise anonymous 29 - year - old working for an airline , who is a major @entity3 fan and an aspiring screenwriter
the @ @entity206 tribute @entity198 handle has attracted more than 58,000 followers , including many journalists with whom he jousts in character
the point is that the character of @entity64 is so well developed that fans can adopt his voice and persona to engage in real debates and make some impact
that 's a mark of a fictional character that has come to life
and it indicates how much interest there is in a real - life newsman who would play the role of @entity64 -- razor - sharp , principled and ignorance - intolerant -- in real life
which brings me to the final reason " @entity8 " matters
at a time when trust in media is declining because of the rise of partisan news , when newspapers seem to be dying every day and online clicks reward stories about celebrity scandals and soft - focus pictures of kittens , " @entity8 " offers an inspirational alternate reality
the pr industry might be bigger than journalism and certainly pays better , so the attraction for young would - be reporters has to be something bigger than a paycheck or job stability
the attraction is a job that comes with a built - in sense of purpose , that sweet soul spot where idealism meets realism
that 's what journalism at its best promises to provide
and even though the reality might involve long hours , lots of criticism and little compensation , our democracy depends on it
so spare me the easy cynicism and petty complaints
if " @entity8 " helps inspire a few more talented young people to enter the world of journalism , as " @entity6 " did for a generation of politicos before it , that is a valuable contribution to contemporary culture -- and much more than most tv shows would ever promise to provide
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .
