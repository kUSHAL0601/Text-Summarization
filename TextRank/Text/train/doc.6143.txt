-- @entity1 denied rising @entity3 star @entity2 his second straight @entity5 title as he rounded off a three - set final victory in @entity7 with a diving forehand passing winner
it wrapped up a 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 6 - 7 ( 11 - 13 ) 7 - 5 victory for the @entity13 top seed after sunday 's epic battle with his 20 - year - old opponent , which lasted two hours 26 minutes
" that 's the best shot i 've ever hit in my life , considering the circumstance , " @entity1 told the official @entity5 website
" he had a great volley there
i do n't really remember much else besides the fact that i went for the ball
i did n't really think much of it
then i heard people cheering
i was like , ' no , there 's no way that went in
' " @entity2 , who came to prominence by claiming the @entity5 title in @entity33 last week as a wildcard entry , pushed the world number eight to the limit , leveling the match when he won a marathon second - set tiebreak

" i think i was very fortunate , " @entity1 added
" i feel like i got outplayed
i just stuck around and kept trying
" he 's as exciting a talent as we have seen in a while
it wo n't surprise me if he 's top - 10 sooner rather than later
" @entity1 is third among active players in career titles , trailing only @entity60 and @entity61 after adding to his @entity7 wins in 2002 and 2009
@entity2 , playing just his ninth top - level tournament , climbed to 37th in the world -- making him the highest - ranked @entity3 player in @entity5 history , surpassing the 41st reached by @entity67 in 1994 before he opted for @entity69 citizenship
" it 's not by any means something to be too happy with because i want to keep improving that
i want to keep progressing and developing and i think i can do a lot more , " @entity2 said
" a lot has happened since the beginning of the year
i 'm going to take the moments i need , take the time , think about it , learn from it , as well as use it to my advantage in the future
" @entity2 's compatriot @entity83 suffered disappointment in the women 's final in @entity7 , having to withdraw with a stomach injury after losing the first set 6 - 2 to @entity90 's @entity89
