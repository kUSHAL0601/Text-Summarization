-- for the better part of a decade , superheroes on the big screen have been big business ( " @entity5 " the most recent example )
on tv , however , keeping audiences coming back each week for the exploits of those with superpowers has been a far trickier task
it 's been a long time since " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 " and " @entity16 " hit prime time
one show that has been able to get it right is " @entity23 , " which begins its record - breaking tenth season friday night on the @entity21 ( that would be the longest consecutively running sci - fi show )
what began as a revised history of @entity27 's teen years in @entity23 has come a long way over the years , with @entity29 fighting crime in @entity31 as a rarely - seen hero called " the @entity33 , " the introduction of @entity35 , and other superheroes occasionally joining the fray
at the same time , what was once one of the highest - rated dramas on tv , " heroes , " progressively lost viewers , ending its run on @entity44 after four seasons
but that does n't mean that networks are giving up on the genre : two more series , one with a caped crusader and another about a superheroic family are coming soon
so what are some of the secrets to success for superhero tv ? we asked producers and cast members of some of these series to find out
make your superheroes believable when " @entity23 " started , the writers had a slogan : " no flights , no tights
" their version of @entity29 would n't take up the mantle of @entity27 , or even @entity70
instead the @entity72 - turned - @entity21 series would focus on human drama
executive producer @entity74 said , " [ series creators @entity75 and @entity77 ] created a world you could see walking into every week
even though we 're in @entity31 and we 're really touching on the @entity27 world , it 's still a world where you can see yourself having coffee with the characters
" " it started out being about a family in @entity88 struggling to make ends meet , " added fellow executive producer @entity85
" we always emphasize the emotions
at its heart , i hope it would touch people and give them a place to come home to
" despite appearances by more and more characters wearing elaborate costumes ( @entity102 and @entity103 , for example ) , @entity74 and @entity85 say that they have always grounded the show in a real place
" we all could relate to the @entity29 at the start of the show , " said @entity74
" it 's great to watch that kid see people in costumes and see people flying with wings , as he interacts with them and we see that in his eyes
" another show that hopes to emphasize the humanity in the superhuman ( without costumes as well ) is @entity122 's new series " @entity123 " ( premiering september 28 )
in it , @entity124 and @entity125 play the heads of a family who find themselves having been granted extraordinary powers following an accident
back in july , @entity124 described it as " a family show wrapped in a police procedural wrapped in the superhero genre
" " the first season should feel like the first act of a superhero movie , " said " family " producer @entity136
" the slow discovery of what it means , and how it affects your real life ... like yes , i can run fast , but i can also make breakfast fast ! you can have the fun stuff in conjunction with the danger
" " family " co-creator @entity151 explained that they wanted their show to have no costumes ( at first ) , either : " i think the goal is , what if it happened to us ? " he said
" there 's so many things that in the real version of a person getting his abilities , the costume seems like something that would be in the future
the costumes , if they ever did show up , would come much later
give the characters a good origin @entity171 , who created the @entity44 series " heroes , " certainly agrees about making the characters relatable
" i was mainly interested in the idea of powers and how people wrestled with and dealt with the idea of discovery of something new , " he said
" to me the origin story is in many ways the most fascinating part of it
" viewers agreed , as the show 's first season was one of @entity44 's biggest hits at the time
" there was that kind of transparency between your life and characters on the show
our characters really did n't live heightened lives and their world did n't have that kind of gothic - y look , " he said
" they were very much like us
for me that was the important thing
" @entity44 has another series inspired by comic books on the horizon , and its main character also has an intriguing backstory
" @entity216 , " premiering early next year , is about an innocent man falsely accused of a crime , and seemingly killed while running from the authorities
instead he goes into hiding and takes on the guise of the @entity219 , a comic book hero whom his son idolizes
actor @entity224 described the show as being " in the tradition of crime drama that just takes place in this fantastic world
it 's based in reality , and that helps you believe in what 's going on a little more
do n't try to be " lost " ( or " heroes " ) @entity237 , one of the best known comic book writers in the business , was named the head of @entity242 television back in june
he 's quite suited for the role , having had a hand in the tv series " lost " and " heroes
" both shows had long story arcs that ran over an entire season , or longer
however , when it comes to the shows @entity237 hopes to bring to tv , he does n't plan to follow that tradition
" what we 've talked about is more of the model on ' @entity23
' it may have had an overriding arc , but it was more of the emotional arcs that we were following , " he said
" we want to start each show with a problem , and resolve that problem at the end of the episode
whatever the emotional arc is going on , that 's what you care about
if you do n't care about characters , you 're not gon na care about the show
we do n't want a show driven by the plot , we want a show driven by the character
never underestimate the importance of villains for many fans , @entity280 was the most intriguing character on " heroes
" villains came and went but @entity280 , a serial killer driven by the overwhelming desire to acquire more supernatural powers , was a constant ( and @entity289 's performance earned him the opportunity to play the iconic @entity291 in the 2009 " @entity293 " movie )
on " @entity23 , " each season has seen bigger and bigger villains , from @entity296 , to @entity297 , @entity298 , and this season , @entity300
so , for an up - and - coming series like " @entity216 , " the villains were seen as extremely important
" i want to create a classic ' rogues gallery ' like @entity305 or @entity13 's , " said series creator @entity303
in the first episode , he introduces two by the names of @entity308 and @entity309
however , @entity303 says he wo n't overdo it
" in 12 episodes , you wo n't see 12 new villains
you got ta roll out your villains , and make sure they 're solid before you bring them in
" " @entity123 " producers hinted that the family will come up against a major villain as the first season goes along as well
keep it simple when asked to share advice for producers of superhero programs like @entity303 , @entity136 and @entity151 , " heroes ' " @entity171 said , " my advice would be stay away from time travel
" ( indeed , some " heroes " fans felt that some of the overly complex aspects of the show as it went on may have played a hand in its loss of viewership over the years
) " having spent a couple thousand hours , probably , in the writers ' room trying to figure out the rules of time travel , i would caution anybody to stay away from that idea
" " you really ca n't do anything that 's wholly unique in the superpower genre , " @entity171 said
" every power has been thought of
coming up with a brand new power is not really the ultimate goal anymore
i 'm just fascinated to see how these new shows explore the genre
