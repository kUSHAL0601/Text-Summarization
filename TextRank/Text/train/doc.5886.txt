-- the sound of heavy weapons and machine gun fire echoed through the night in the restive city of @entity5 after a large number of tanks moved in to block key roads and areas of town , an opposition activist said monday
" several tanks have been in place since may at each of the entrances of the city , but sunday a great number of tanks began blocking the agriculture parts of the town and the surrounding villages and even took positions inside @entity5 , " said the activist , a member of the opposition @entity13 who could not be identified because of security concerns
elsewhere in @entity26 , security forces captured and killed two activists in @entity28 , a town in @entity30 province , according to the @entity13 , the activist group that has been organizing anti-government protests
students also continued their protests against the rule of @entity26 president @entity35 , chanting , " no teaching , no learning until the fall of the regime " in @entity30 , @entity41 and @entity43 provinces
in @entity5 , more than 50 tanks were in and around the city in the northwestern part of @entity30 province , said the activist , whose claims could not be independently verified
the inflow of security forces means opposition groups are having trouble treating their wounded , the opposition activist told @entity0
" we have a major problem now that even though @entity5 has one of the largest hospitals in @entity30 province we are unable to take our wounded out of fear of retaliation by security forces
currently five to six tanks surround the hospital and we believe they may detain the wounded , " the activist said
people are scared to go to work in the area 's industrial port because it has been surrounded by tanks and " just this week a young man was shot and killed by security forces , " the activist said
the @entity26 government has been battling opposition activists for months in what the government calls a campaign against terrorists
at the @entity80 , foreign minister @entity79 blamed " foreign incitement " for the troubles , which he said were fueled by @entity83 and @entity84 sanctions
" this course can not in any way be reconciled with pronouncements about concern for the interests , security and rights of the @entity26 people , " @entity79 told the @entity86
" it further runs counter to the basic principles of human rights in defense of which these states base their interference in our internal affairs
" he said @entity26 had been " a model of peaceful co-existence " among its people 's religious and ethnic groups , and that disturbing that peace was aimed at " spreading @entity112 hegemony over the countries of the @entity114 and serving @entity116 's expansionist interests
" on monday , the state - run news agency @entity117 published a report citing an unnamed military source saying that authorities found @entity116 weapons , explosives and stolen military uniforms in @entity30 and recovered weapons , ammunition detonators and other military supplies hidden in a drum and a water tank in the garden of a house in @entity132 , a city in @entity41 province
military engineers also dismantled an explosive device next to @entity136 that could have killed more than 300 people , @entity117 reported
nearly 3,000 people have died in the government 's crackdown , according to some accounts
@entity0 's @entity142 contributed to this report .
