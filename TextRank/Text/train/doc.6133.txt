-- a court in @entity2 has sentenced to death more than 500 supporters of the now - banned @entity5 following violence that broke out in the southern city of @entity8 last august
the @entity9 puts the number of those sentenced at 529
a single policeman was killed
only 147 of the defendants were reportedly in court monday
sixteen people were also acquitted at the hearing
another 683 defendants -- including the @entity5 's spiritual leader @entity17 -- appeared before the same judge tuesday in relation to the unrest
their case was adjourned until april 28
@entity0 spoke to its correspondent in @entity23 , @entity24 , independent @entity2 journalist @entity25 and @entity2 legal historian @entity26 about monday 's mass sentence
what happened in @entity8 ? a police officer was murdered during the @entity31 riots in @entity8 last august
the violence followed a deadly crackdown by security forces on two @entity23 sit - ins being held by supporters of former @entity38 president @entity37
@entity37 , @entity2 's first democratically elected president , had been toppled in a military coup in july 2013
defense lawyer @entity41 told @entity0 the charges against the defendants appearing tuesday include breaking into a police station , attempted murder , disturbing public peace and public order
the death sentence imposed on 529 people -- will it be carried out ? @entity24 said it was " highly unlikely " that all those sentenced to death would be executed
he said @entity2 had a large appeals process and the country 's chief @entity55 authority -- the grand mufti -- also had to approve the death sentences
many death sentences in @entity2 are later reduced , or overturned , @entity24 said
" when you hear something like this , well it is shocking , but you do have to step back and say there 's a lot between the sentencing and the execution
" @entity26 also said it was most likely the sentences would be appealed and revised
" with regard those on the run , they automatically have the right for an entire new trial , in addition to the right of appeal following the issuance of the sentence , " he said
@entity80 , a lawyer representing some of those sentenced to death , said that they would appeal the verdict after the @entity85 had made his decision allowing the court to announce its final ruling -- set for april 28
how was the trial conducted ? the @entity8 court has been criticized for taking just two sessions to reach its verdict against the 529 people convicted
" never before has a court issued such a large number of death sentences in such a short period of time -- only two sessions , " @entity26 said
the @entity2 news organization @entity99 said the court had issued its verdict " -- the biggest capital punishment verdict in the history of the @entity2 judiciary -- without hearing the defense arguments
" @entity41 told @entity0 his team of lawyers were n't allowed inside the courtroom
he said they did n't have any time to plead the case or review the evidence as the first procedural session was on saturday , before being postponed until monday -- when the verdict was issued
one defendant told @entity0 he had n't been summoned for questioning by the prosecution or by the court for the trial
the man , who requested anonymity , said he had n't been in @entity8 during the incident
the verdict was " unjust " he said and the accusations " invalid
" another defendant -- who also asked not to be named -- told @entity0 he had been at home during the violence
he said he believed he had been added to the list of defendants just because he was a member of the anti-coup alliance
ten members of the alliance had also died that day , he claimed , and no one had been held accountable
how does the sentence compare to others ? @entity26 said the court 's ruling made a " mockery of the entire @entity2 legal system
" " as a historian of the @entity2 legal system , i can confidently say that this court ruling is a travesty of justice , " he said
" never before in @entity2 's long history has there ever been a ruling so obscene in its contradiction of the very principles of justice
" @entity26 described the ruling as " particularly perverse " as it handed down death sentences against 529 defendants accused of killing a single police officer
journalist @entity156 said the sentence was " ridiculous and a grave injustice
" " ridiculous because it 's not possible that 529 people can murder a police officer -- which was one of the charges against the defendants
the other charge is less serious of course -- destruction of public property -- and does n't deserve a death sentence
" @entity156 said the judiciary was displaying double standards
she pointed to the death of @entity174 in 2010 , whose alleged brutal beating by security forces is said to have been one of the factors behind the 2011 revolution that led to the ousting of then - president @entity181
" the killer of @entity174 got a 10 - year prison sentence , " she said
meantime , @entity99 pointed to the sentencing of a police officer to 10 years imprisonment for the deaths of 37 islamists in a police van last year as a " sharply contrasting verdict
" how has the @entity2 public reacted to the verdicts ? @entity156 said the verdict had been received with shock
" the harsh sentence came as a big shock to me and many others including @entity2 's liberals , many of whom oppose the @entity5 , " said journalist @entity156
" @entity37 's supporters are calling it a ' death penalty for the judicial system in @entity2 ' , " she said
" you still find supporters of the military who say that they deserve it , these are terrorists
that 's because the country is extremely and deeply polarized and anyone seen to show sympathy -- even remotely -- for the @entity5 is labeled a traitor and accused of being one of them , " she said
@entity26 said he had little doubt that the ruling was politically motivated
" it is as if the judge wanted to appease the military rulers of the country who decided to wage a ' @entity223 ' and have declared the @entity5 a terrorist organization , " he said
@entity26 claimed the sentence had made " a mockery of the entire @entity2 legal system , " and in the process undermines a fundamental pillar of society -- the very principle that the regime is accusing the @entity5 of doing
" in other words , if there is anyone who is undermining the stability of the @entity2 state , it is the judiciary and its incessant desire to appease the military and the police , " he said
@entity156 said it was " clear that courts are being used to settle political scores
" " the courts are one more battleground for the political standoff between the military backed authorities and the @entity38 group , " she said
" so basically , the verdict is a threat to @entity5 supporters -- and also to opponents of the regime in general -- that there 's zero tolerance for dissent
" @entity24 said the verdict can be seen as part of the ongoing crackdown on the @entity5 and their supporters in which hundreds have died and thousands arrested
the irony , he said , is that while 529 people were sentenced to death over the killing of one police officer and attempted murder of another , no one has been held accountable for the deaths of hundreds of protesters
how has @entity2 's government responded ? @entity2 's government , through its foreign ministry , stressed the independence of the country 's judiciary in a statement to @entity0
" the @entity2 government would like to affirm that the @entity2 judiciary is entirely independent and is not influenced in any way by the executive branch of government , as dictated by the democratic principle of separation of powers , " the ministry said
the ministry pointed out that the @entity8 sentence had been issued by an independent court " after careful study of the case ; that it was only the first verdict in the trial process ; and that the defendants would be able to contest the verdict in the @entity299
" what about the @entity5 ? the @entity5 issued a statement saying the sentence " violates judicial norms
" " the shocking and unprecedented sentencing of 529 @entity5 supporters without due process is evidently inhumane and a clear violation of all norms of humane and legal justice , " it said in a statement on its website
" the verdict is yet another clear indication that the corrupt judiciary is being utilized by the coup commanders to suppress the @entity2 revolution and install a brutal regime which has already surpassed decades long of oppression and tyranny in @entity2 's history
" in december , @entity2 's interim government officially declared the @entity5 a terrorist organization
it said anyone who was a member would be punished , as would those found to be giving the group financial support
what 's happened to @entity37 ? @entity37 , the former head of the @entity5 's political arm , was elected president in 2012
shortly after winning , he resigned from the @entity5 and its @entity330 in an effort to show that he would represent all @entity2
but he was ousted in a coup in july 2013 amid widespread protests against his rule , with opponents accusing him of pursuing an @entity38 agenda and excluding other factions from the government
@entity37 and other @entity5 leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts , including organizing attacks on @entity2 troops in the @entity346 and fueling " sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in @entity2
" 529 sentenced to death in @entity2 @entity5 banned what is the @entity5 lawyers in @entity5 case seek new judges
