-- a controversial ranking of @entity4 cities ' crime rates indicates @entity5 , @entity6 , has the worst crime rate , while a @entity9 exurb has the lowest
a @entity5 resident talks to police after returning home to find his house had been looted in september
the @entity15 " @entity22 " list named @entity5 its most crime - ridden city based on a reported 19,000 - plus incidences of six major crimes -- including 209 murder cases -- in 2007
the @entity24 city of about 250,000 , still grappling with the aftermath of 2005 's @entity26 , was followed in the rankings by @entity28 , @entity29 ; @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 ; and @entity34 , @entity35
the lowest crime rate was reported in @entity37 , @entity9 , about 40 miles northwest of @entity9 , with only 688 total crimes and no reported killings in a city of about 113,000
it was followed by @entity42 , @entity35 , south of @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity33 , outside @entity32 ; @entity45 , @entity46 , west of @entity48 ; and @entity49 , on the @entity29 coast
previous editions have been criticized by criminologists and the @entity53 as a misreading of federal crime statistics
the @entity56 , which compiles its own @entity58 statistics , warns that ranking cities against each other can produce " simplistic and / or incomplete analyses , " and the @entity61 called last year 's @entity15 report " an irresponsible misuse of the data
" the study 's publishers said they dropped previous characterizations of " safest " and " most dangerous " from this year 's study , calling those qualities " perceptions of the individuals who live in these communities
" but they defended the comparisons as a valuable tool for researchers and the public
" the book provides the means by which individuals can compare local communities to other similar communities based on comparison to the national level of reported crime as well as crime rates per 100,000 of individual types of reported crime , violent and property crime categories , and overall , " the company says in a statement accompanying the data
the @entity15 report rated 397 cities larger than 75,000 and 356 metropolitan areas , some of which ranked very differently from their core cities alone
the @entity5 area was third on the metropolitan - areas list , behind @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104
@entity28 , the second - worst city on the cities list , ranked 219th among metro areas
among metro areas , @entity108 , @entity109 , north of @entity110 , had the lowest crime rate , followed by @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , @entity9 , the report said
. the data is drawn from @entity56 statistics on murder , rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , theft and motor vehicle theft .
