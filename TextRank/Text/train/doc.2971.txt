the ex-madam and political candidate who claimed she supplied former @entity4 gov. @entity3 with escorts pleaded guilty friday to pushing prescription drugs , the @entity0 said
@entity10 , 38 , who ran against @entity3 for the office of comptroller , admitted in @entity14 federal court to one count of " distributing and possessing with intent to distribute controlled substances , specifically alprazolam , zolpidem and carisoprodol , " @entity7 , @entity8 attorney for the @entity9 , said in a statement
@entity7 said @entity22 illegally sold " hundreds of highly - addictive and dangerous prescription pills " and helped fuel " the fastest - growing drug problem in the country " and a " public health epidemic
" @entity22 faces up to 5 years in prison when she is sentenced july 25
under the plea agreement , she also agreed to forfeit $ 1,765
her lawyer , @entity31 , told @entity32 that he plans to ask for leniency
" i 'm hoping that she can remain at liberty so that she can pursue her new career and complete her current studies , " he said
" she 's going to school ... but at this point i just want to protect her privacy
it 's more career - oriented ... to put herself in a position to gain new skills so she pursue a new career once this case is wrapped up
" @entity22 was arrested on the drug charges last august when she was running an unsuccessful campaign for comptroller against @entity3
the former governor has denied using the services of the ex-madam
based on a tip from an @entity58 witness , agents set up a sting operation from january through march of 2013 and caught her pushing pills on three separate occasions to the witness , who she believed to be a drug dealer , prosecutors said
@entity22 became synonymous with the prostitution scandal involving @entity3 , then serving as governor
she never provided proof that she arranged escorts for @entity3 , but she did spend four months behind bars for running an escort firm
@entity3 , a @entity73 , resigned in 2008

a former hedge fund senior vice president , @entity22 ran as a libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in @entity79
