-- @entity1 continued his sensational scoring form with a hat - trick as @entity4 set a new @entity6 record of 16 successive league victories on saturday
the two - time world player of the year netted all three goals against @entity10 to take his total to the season in all competitions to a staggering 40
the @entity14 forward also moved one ahead of @entity19 star @entity18 's previous leading @entity17 tally of 23
@entity19 's 1960 - 61 team , spearheaded by @entity14 - born @entity21 , held the previous record
@entity24 's team went 10 points clear of @entity19 , who host @entity27 on sunday , and have now scored 70 goals from 22 league matches -- the most of any team in the main @entity32 divisions
@entity4 have also conceded only 11 times in that period , and the closest they came to a 12th against @entity10 at @entity35 was when @entity36 cleared off the line from @entity38 with the score at 2 - 0
@entity1 broke the deadlock in the 17th minute as he cut in from the right in trademark fashion and fired a left - foot shot from the edge of the box across goalkeeper @entity46
the 23 - year - old doubled the lead in the 28th minute , pouncing after @entity50 's threaded pass bounced kindly into his path
the forward duo combined again for the third with 11 minutes to play , with @entity1 this time teeing up @entity53 and then reacting fastest when the @entity56 international 's shot rebounded off the legs of @entity58
it was @entity1 's first hat - trick of 2011 , coming off his six in the previous calendar year
he is now on course to easily surpass last season 's tally of 47 with more than two months left to play
@entity1 also hit the crossbar with a second - half free - kick , but was booked for taking it too quickly
the result left @entity10 in seventh place on goal difference above @entity72 , who won 4 - 1 at home to @entity75 earlier on saturday
@entity76 retained third place despite suffering a shock 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity80 , who moved off the bottom thanks to @entity84 's winning goal three minutes after halftime
the former @entity87 midfielder collected a long pass and rounded goalkeeper to inflict @entity76 's first home defeat since may , having dropped points only once at @entity92 this season against fourth - placed @entity94
@entity95 moved up to fifth with a 3 - 0 win at home to @entity98 , who had defender @entity100 sent off for a second booking that led to @entity103 's 15th - minute penalty opener
@entity104 doubled the lead in the 28th minute and striker @entity106 sealed victory in the second half
the @entity109 leapfrogged @entity87 , whose @entity32 qualification hopes were hit by a 3 - 2 defeat at second - bottom @entity113
the @entity4 - based team could not come back from a 3 - 0 deficit inside 18 minutes
that result put @entity117 , who travel to @entity119 on sunday , at the foot of the table
@entity122 were held 1 - 1 at home by struggling @entity124 , while @entity125 earned the same result at @entity127
in @entity129 , @entity128 moved up to fifth place with a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity133 as @entity135 midfielder @entity134 opened the scoring in the 18th minute and striker @entity137 netted his 100th league goal before halftime
@entity133 , who sold star strikers @entity141 and @entity142 last month , suffered a fourth consecutive defeat to be 13th in the @entity145 table
@entity146 lifted the pressure on coach @entity148 with a 3 - 1 victory at @entity150 that lifted the @entity152 club up to seventh
january signing @entity153 scored the opening two goals against his former club , while veteran striker @entity158 came off the bench to seal victory six minutes from the end with his first for @entity146
in sunday 's top games , leaders @entity168 travel to @entity170 , champions @entity165 host @entity163 , second - placed @entity162 are at home to @entity173 and @entity174 welcome @entity175 .
