-- @entity1 has served up a few changes to his support team at the end of the tennis season but there is one person who is n't going anywhere -- his new fianc√©e @entity7
the @entity11 world no. 6 has popped the question to his long - standing girlfriend , his management confirmed
the good news for the 27 - year - old @entity15 is that she said aye , do ! @entity1 got himself into hot water in january with a spoof tweet in reply to a fan 's question saying he and @entity22 planned to marry after @entity23
@entity7 , who met @entity1 at the @entity24 in 2005 , answered the speculation on the @entity27 account she runs for the couple 's dogs @entity28 and @entity31
" fyi , nobody is getting married
his tweets need a sarcasm disclaimer , " she responded
it may be game , set and match in @entity1 's love life but the 2013 @entity23 champion has decided to split from coach @entity40 and fitness trainer @entity41
" we sat down at the end of the season and decided that a change would be best for all of us , " @entity1 said on this website
" my off season training and @entity49 preparations have already begun and i am very excited for the new year
" there is still another woman in @entity1 's life , however
he will continue to work with @entity55 double grand slam winner @entity53 , who he appointed as his new coach in june
@entity1 's engagement means three quarters of the " @entity59 " in the men 's global game are now off the market
@entity63 married his long - standing girlfriend @entity64 after winning a second @entity23 title this summer
the couple announced the birth of their first child , a son @entity70 , in october
it was also a family focused year for @entity73 , whose wife @entity74 gave birth to a second set of twins -- boys @entity78 and @entity80 -- in may
if anything more double diaper trouble for the @entity84 17 - time grand slam champion seemed to bring an upswing in form
the 33 - year - old finished the season as the world @entity89 after winning the @entity91 for the first time with @entity84
@entity93 has been dating childhood sweetheart @entity94 , who is also from the @entity96 island of @entity97 , for more than eight years
the question is will the world no. 3 now feel any peer pressure to propose ?
