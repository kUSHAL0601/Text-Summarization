-- federal authorities arrested a 37 - year - old @entity3 woman on thursday after she allegedly concocted a ruse in the wake of the @entity7 mass shooting and posed as a relative of one of the slain children
@entity11 is accused of using her @entity13 account to solicit money from those wanting to donate to victims ' families , claiming that the money was to be used for a " funeral fund , " according to a @entity22 @entity21 statement
the donors apparently transmitted the money to a @entity27 account controlled by @entity11 , who later allegedly lied about the scam to federal investigators , prosecutors said
@entity30 : no more gifts , please " this arrest should serve as a warning to anyone who attempts to profit from this tragedy by contriving fraudulent schemes that exploit the many victims , their families and individuals who sincerely want to help , " said @entity7 @entity22 attorney @entity32 in a statement
on december 14 , a 20 - year old gunman opened fire in @entity30 's @entity45 , killing 26 people just after he killed his mother in their @entity30 home
@entity11 has since been charged with lying to federal agents and was released on $ 50,000 bond
if convicted , she faces up to five years in jail and a maximum $ 250,000 fine
on december 19 , @entity0 's " @entity56 " broadcast a story about the alleged ruse and interviewed @entity11 , who denied her involvement in the alleged scam
" this says -- this has your e-mail on it
right there , " said @entity0 investigative producer @entity62
" this is about @entity45 's funeral
" " i never sent that , " @entity11 replied
later , in the interview @entity11 identified one of her e-mail accounts presented by @entity70
" yeah , that 's one of my gmails
... yeah , my personal account , " she said during the interview
" but i never set up any funds for anybody
" geneticists studying @entity7 shooter 's dna @entity82 's family issued a statement saying , " we are pleased that law enforcement has pursued this matter so diligently
we hope that this dissuades other scammers from trying to take advantage of this horrible tragedy
