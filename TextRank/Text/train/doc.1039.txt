-- @entity2 's health ministry is asking people to avoid beaches in @entity5 and north of the capital until officials can determine what caused the deaths of hundreds of dolphins and pelicans
last month , the country 's production ministry said the authorities were investigating the deaths of more than 538 pelicans , and other birds , on the northern coast
state - run tv @entity2 estimated that as many as to 1,200 birds have been found dead along the 100 miles ( 160km ) of northern shoreline extending from @entity22 , in @entity23 , to @entity24 Â© , in the state of @entity26
that discovery came after close to 900 dolphins washed up dead on the northern coast of @entity2 this year
the investigation into the deaths of both the dolphins and the birds is ongoing , and it is not clear whether they are connected
the health ministry advised anyone who might handle any of the dead birds to wear protective clothing , such as gloves and masks
@entity2 deputy environment minister @entity42 told @entity0 last month the dolphins may have died from an outbreak of @entity46 or @entity47 bacteria
@entity46 is a class of viruses that are part of the same family as human measles ; brucella bacteria are the cause of many serious diseases in animals
officials have said the dolphins ' deaths were not due to lack of food , interaction with fisheries , poisoning with pesticides , biotoxin poisoning or contamination by heavy metals
" when you have something this large , my gut would tell me that there 's something traumatic that happened , " @entity66 , a marine biologist with the @entity67 , told @entity0 last month
she raised a number of possibilities as to what could have killed the animals , including acoustic trauma
preliminary reports ruled out the possibility that seismic sound waves created by oil exploration in the area could have killed the birds , the environment ministry has said
bird flu has also been ruled out .
