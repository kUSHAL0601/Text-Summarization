@entity0 -- @entity4 geese got into both engines of @entity6 and forced the plane to ditch into the @entity8 last month , the @entity2 said thursday
surveillance video shows passengers of @entity6 hurrying onto the plane 's wings
the flight crew of the @entity14 put the plane down gently on the river , which separates @entity17 from @entity18 , after the bird ingestion caused both engines to lose power on january 15
all 155 people aboard survived
adult @entity4 geese weigh between 5.8 and 10.7 pounds , although birds from resident populations rather than migratory populations can be heavier
the plane 's @entity28 turbofan engines were certified in 1996 as being able to withstand bird ingestion of 4 pounds
the @entity2 said last week that both engines contained the remains of birds , confirming the pilots ' report that the engines shut down after colliding with birds less than two minutes after taking off from from @entity17 's @entity38
material from both engines was sent to the @entity41 in @entity0 for identification of the bird species
investigators have not yet determined how many birds hit the jet 's engines
the plane 's flight data recorder " revealed no anomalies or malfunctions in either engine up to the point where the captain reported a bird strike , after which there was an uncommanded loss of thrust in both engines , " the @entity2 said last week .
