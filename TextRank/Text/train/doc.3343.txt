@entity0 might be off to a slow start but it 's starting to pick up steam , at least in states that are not using the beleaguered @entity5 website
blocked out at @entity6 ? bypass on way soon , feds say for the past month , @entity8 has conducted a state - by - state survey to determine enrollment in the new insurance plans
as of tuesday afternoon , at least 133,257 people had chosen new insurance plans in the 14 states with their own signup apparatuses
nearly half of them were enrolled in the past two weeks
one of the biggest jumps is in @entity19
through november 2 , 35,364 @entity19 had selected private plans through the new insurance marketplace
less than two weeks later , the number was up to 59,000
the state with the second - highest enrollment is @entity25 , where at least 24,509 have selected a plan
the next highest enrollments are in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30
bad news for woman cited as @entity0 success story enrollment is harder to pin down in the 36 states using @entity5 , although it 's running well behind the states with their own programs
as of november 2 , just 26,794 people had enrolled in the @entity5 states
@entity8 's current tally for this group is 43,743 enrollees , but that 's based on just a handful of states that have provided updates
in addition , 58,857 newly eligible people have enrolled in state medicaid programs , with another 275,131 people signed up to start @entity53 coverage on january 1 , 2014
@entity54 , healthy needed aside from raw enrollment numbers , the data are being scrutinized for any hints about the makeup of the newly insured
in its projections , the @entity59 estimated that 7 million people would enroll in private insurance plans through the marketplaces in 2014 , and that 2.7 million -- about 38 % of the total -- would be between the ages of 18 and 34
" there 's general agreement that we need younger and healthier people to offset the costs of sicker people coming into the system , " says @entity66 , a spokesman for @entity67 , an industry group
" that 's what will add more stability
" if the concentration of older and sicker enrollees in the new plans is too high , insurers could be forced to raise their rates , which would further discourage young and healthy people from signing up
taken to an extreme , this vicious cycle could -- in theory -- lead to what @entity0 critics call a " death spiral " and the collapse of the law
industry spokesman : too early to draw conclusions so , how 's it going ? it 's a limited picture
@entity97 has n't released demographic data for people signing up through @entity5 , and only three states provided their own data to @entity8
in those states , the number of under - 35 enrollees is less than @entity59 projected : in @entity29 , 19 % of enrollees are age 18 - 34
in @entity30 and @entity28 , the figures are 22 % and 23 % , respectively
but @entity66 says it 's way too early to draw conclusions
" there 's lots of evidence to suggest that people needing serious medical care are most likely to purchase insurance initially
those who do n't have urgent medical needs are more likely to purchase insurance later
" missing from @entity0 : working & middle class what 's more , age is only a piece of the puzzle
since those applying for insurance no longer disclose anything about their health , @entity66 says insurers wo n't have a good sense of their medical needs -- and what it will cost to cover them -- until well into 2014
obamacare architect : no risk of a ' death spiral ' the law 's supporters say the dire scenarios are farfetched
" there is essentially no risk of a ' death spiral , ' " says @entity140 economist @entity139 , who helped design the @entity0 as well as the @entity142 law on which it was modeled
" there are substantial risk mitigation mechanisms as well as subsidies that will attract in healthy enrollees
" most important , say @entity139 and @entity66 , is a section of the @entity0 under which the federal government will pick up a substantial portion of the losses for the next three years , if the program goes sour for insurers
there 's no precedent for a program of this size and scale , and @entity139 warns that that the early data are ripe for overinterpretation
while fewer young and healthy customers would mean higher premiums , " it 's hard to say how big a difference 28 % vs. 38 % makes -- we just do n't know
" the trends are likely to come into sharper focus in the next several weeks
most experts expect the pace of enrollment to accelerate , as the @entity5 website starts to function better and potential customers have more of a chance to explore their options
so far , by @entity8 's count nearly 900,000 people have completed applications for new insurance but have not yet selected a plan
poll suggests @entity0 could have cost @entity183 second term @entity185 : why @entity186 better hope @entity183 's lying @entity188 : chill -- obamacare snafus are fixable states slap insurers for misleading letters
