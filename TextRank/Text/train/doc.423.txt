-- a car bomb exploded wednesday in @entity4 's restive @entity3 region , killing 10 soldiers and injuring 31 others who were on their way to the capital on leave
state media reports said a suicide bomber set off the blast as two minibuses carrying infantry soldiers were passing by
last month , a suicide bomber blew up a car in @entity4 's @entity3 , killing four security officers and wounding four others
and a bombing that targeted a military intelligence building bordering on the @entity3 , wounded at least six soldiers
no claim of responsibility has been reported in wednesday 's attack
@entity26 militants have become more active in the @entity3 in recent years
the @entity4 revolution of 2011 that toppled strongman president @entity29 brought a resurgence of islamists whom his military regime had repressed for decades
this included more moderate factions like the @entity36 , which swept into power when @entity38 became president in @entity4 's first democratic elections
but it also included extremists , some suspected of having affiliations with @entity44
in the @entity3 , they called for the establishment of an @entity26 caliphate
the @entity4 military began cracking down on them again
in july , when the military ousted @entity38 in a coup , @entity26 extremists in the @entity3 saw it as an attack against @entity52 and have stepped up their assaults , particularly against soldiers and military installations
@entity4 's @entity38 says he 's still the legitimate president @entity0 's @entity56 contributed to this story
