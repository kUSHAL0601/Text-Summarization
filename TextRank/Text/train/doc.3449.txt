, 3,700 post offices , 300 mail processing plants , or even the post office itself ? with millions of jobs and businesses lost to the recent recession , these may seem like just more numbers , or more seemingly inevitable " facts " -- that in the electronic age we now rely on the private sector to deliver public services
but postal workers are people we depend on and post offices are places we want to know will always be there
downsizing the @entity24 - - which is so low on money , it 's in imminent danger of default -- may seem like a ripple in this troubled economy , but it promises to be a social tsunami if action is n't taken soon to save it
for one thing , the postal service has been a huge employer
before i became a history professor i carried mail for the @entity24 for 20 years
as with many government jobs , you 're hired for this one based on achieving a high score on a competitive exam
veterans , roughly 20 % of today 's postal workforce ( though once well over 50 % ) earn extra points on this exam , thus giving them a head start and a job to come home to after military service
who were my co-workers ? just everyday people who , like me in 1980 , were attracted to a job that had good benefits , job security , and started at $ 8.10 an hour
this was as a result of the 1970 nationwide postal wildcat strike that began in @entity59 after postal workers declared they were tired of earning $ 2.95 an hour and having to work a second job or collect food stamps to make ends meet
in collecting oral histories for a book i later wrote on the postal service , i interviewed those who had worked before 1970 , including those who struck
the postal worker 's job could include processing mail as clerks and mail handlers , delivering it as letter carriers , driving it as truck drivers , and as maintenance workers keeping up the vehicles , buildings , and grounds
above all , postal workers were proud of having a career serving the public
the job allowed many to move into the ranks of middle - class wage earners , where they were able to buy homes and send their children to college
but they were also members of extended families and community networks
many started small businesses on the side , adopted foster children , were active in civic organizations , or enrolled in college classes
their jobs mattered to communities
postal jobs have especially played a key role in black community development
the post office has long been one of the largest employers of @entity107
even as they faced discrimination at other jobs , many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts
by 1970 , they had become twice as likely as whites to work for the post office , and even before the wage bump that year , the job had afforded them a middle - class status and the ability to accumulate wealth
today the nation relies on a vast mailing industry that operates primarily for profit
but that network is underpinned by the @entity24 -- a self - supporting quasi-corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate
many @entity107 may not realize that it was the @entity24 that pioneered parcel post in 1916 in response to the overpriced , poor , and inconsistent service disaster that was private package delivery
or that the @entity24 came up with the concept of overnight mail and zip codes that @entity135 and @entity136 rely on so heavily in their business
many do n't make the connection that e-commerce not only competes with but also generates @entity142 mail
or that during the turn of this century -- the @entity24 's peak years of revenue and mail handling -- it was common to hear competitors and political ideologues calling for the agency 's privatization , while at the same time blocking @entity24 innovations like the proposed 1997 @entity153 program to help expedite parcels through customs
or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 @entity159 , signed by president @entity160 , which forces the @entity24 to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years
what should have been annual revenue surpluses for the @entity24 over the last decade have instead contributed to nightmare annual deficits as it is forced to pay $ 5.5 billion a year out of operating funds to satisfy this unnecessary and devastating mandate
. we lose more than numbers when we lose postal jobs and post offices , or even the existence of a universal postal service
we lose more than just people committed to providing service , but also people engaged with their communities
people able to consume goods that others produce to help drive local economies
we would also lose the promise of jobs in the future that provide what has become a more dependable service over two centuries since the founding of this country ( the post office was started in 1775 )
an alternative to this loss ? people could demand that @entity195 treat the @entity24 as a venerable @entity142 institution worthy of fulfilling its enduring mandate , for which it has recruited generations of skilled and dedicated professional government employees
a good start would be @entity201 1351 , introduced by rep. @entity202 , @entity203 , a bill that would at least allow the @entity24 to transfer surplus pension funds to satisfy the retiree health plan pre-fund requirement
and that pre-fund requirement ultimately needs to be repealed to keep the @entity24 from running off the rails
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212
