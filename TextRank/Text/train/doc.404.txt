-- once again , we confront the specter of a school day bathed in bloodshed
a 16 - year - old , @entity5 , allegedly takes two long knives into a crowded corridor and sends 20 classmates and an adult to the hospital with grave injuries
arraigned as an adult , @entity5 looks all too familiar : thin , scared , vacant - eyed
he looks younger than his years as he is manacled and maneuvered into a police car
we have not yet filled in a motive
@entity5 's attorney says , " he worked well in groups , and this happened
so there 's a reason for it -- that 's what i 'm saying
and we have to get to the bottom of that
" and because it was knives , not guns , it was -- thankfully -- not a massacre
but much about the attack is familiar
fifteen years ago , my doctoral students and i devoted two years to studying rampage shootings in @entity33 high schools in response to the epidemic epitomized by the 1999 @entity37 shootings
to try to understand what motivates school attackers , we interviewed everyone who had any knowledge of two episodes -- one near @entity43 , @entity44 , and the other outside @entity45 , @entity46 -- that took place in the late ' 90s
@entity48 wanted to know about the circumstances that led to these outbursts in communities that have no experience of murderous violence
what we found at the center of the stories we followed were young men who looked a lot like @entity5
rampage attacks happen in safe , relatively isolated communities
indeed , they are most common in small rural towns where the biggest public " stage " is the local high school , the place the community gathers for events such as football games on saturdays and everybody knows your name
the perpetrators are often described in the media as loners , but they are not
they are most often " failed joiners , " people who work overtime to ingratiate themselves into cliques that reject them
but they do n't stop trying
fading into the background , close to anonymous , but rarely ever thought of as troublemakers , the protagonists look for ways to gain acceptance and attention
they may act like clowns ; they sometimes bully other children ; they steal -- all to seek the approval of social groups that continuously deny them recognition
in the instances we studied , all that effort starts to pay off the day they start talking about killing people
suddenly they are the objects of attention
they may even find their " friends " goading them
@entity105 , the shooter in @entity44 , resembled @entity5
slight and short , he was a freshman who simply could not cut it in the world of high school peers
he was socially awkward and a bit of prankster , but he was n't a loner
@entity112 tried to gain the friendship of many different social groups and finally landed in the laps of the @entity116 , boys who wore satanic garb and spoke in dark tones but who were actually among the smart ones
they told @entity112 that the pistol he stole from home was n't good enough , that he should come to school in a trench coat sporting a shotgun
@entity112 was so eager to gain their approval that he followed these instructions almost to the letter
three kids huddled together in a prayer group were murdered , one was paralyzed from the waist down and a fifth was hit in the arms , her athletic career ended in an instant
but when @entity112 shot these innocents , what was uppermost in his mind was not that he was going to kill kids but rather how this bold act would help him gain traction with the @entity116
they would see him as notorious and dangerous rather than a loser who was awkward and boring
he told the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed him after his arrest that he had found a route to popularity
the @entity116 would visit his house and invite him to their homes
he would have friends once he proved himself worthy of their respect
we do n't know yet if the @entity160 , @entity161 , suspect fits this profile
the surprise that so many of his schoolmates have expressed comes close to what teachers told us about @entity112 : that they could have named 50 others who might have committed this kind of mayhem before they got to him
the son of a lawyer and a homemaker , until the previous year a good student , with no obvious interest in guns , @entity112 was not on their radar screen
but many teenagers avoided school on the monday that @entity112 murdered his classmates because they knew something bad was coming
one thing we should be grateful for : the attacker in @entity161 was armed only with knives
had he had access to the weapons @entity112 had , we would have seen dozens die rather than suffer these wounds
knife attacks happen in countries such as @entity192 where guns are hard to access , and they have been lethal
just not as deadly as a loaded high - capacity automatic weapon that requires a split second to gun down dozens of people
this is small comfort in @entity160 .
