a commuter train derailed in a curve in the @entity4 borough of the @entity5 on sunday , killing four people and leaving dozens hurt , investigators said
all seven passenger cars and the locomotive jumped the tracks near the @entity13 station , about 10 miles north of @entity15 's @entity14 , the @entity8 reported
three of the dead were thrown out of the train as it " came off the track and was twisting and turning , " @entity17 chief @entity16 told reporters
surviving passenger @entity25 told @entity26 the windows of the coaches broke out , and " the gravel came flying up in our faces
" " i really did n't know if i would survive , " said @entity25 , who put her bag in front of her face to block the rubble
" the train felt like it was on its side and dragging for a long time
... the whole thing felt like slow motion
" the train was en route to @entity14 from @entity42 , 74 miles up the @entity43 , when it derailed about 7:20 a.m. , @entity8 member @entity39 said sunday
at least 67 people were injured , said @entity47 , @entity4 's commissioner of emergency management , and 11 remained in critical condition sunday evening , gov. @entity45 told reporters
the diesel locomotive was pushing passenger cars through a 30 - mph curve north of the station at the time of the crash , @entity39 said
he said that configuration is one of many things investigators will be examining as they try to determine the cause of the wreck
investigators have recovered an event recorder from the locomotive and another car but have n't yet examined them , @entity39 said
" our mission is to understand not just what happened , but why it happened , with the intent of preventing it from ever happening again , " he said
about 150 people were on the train when it derailed , said @entity74 , director of risk management for @entity4 's @entity75 , which includes the @entity76
one car came to rest just feet away from the @entity79
" i heard this horrible , whooshing sound
... it was very disturbing , very loud , " said @entity82 , who lives near the tracks
" i jumped out of bed and looked out the window and i saw a light - colored object lying down
i thought it was the roadway to the train
then i got my binoculars , and i could n't believe my eyes , that the train had jumped the tracks right here
" @entity4 's @entity75 identified the dead as @entity95 , 54 , of @entity96 , @entity4 ; @entity97 , 58 , of @entity98 , @entity4 ; @entity99 , 59 , of @entity100 , @entity4 ; and @entity101 , 35 , of @entity102 , @entity4
@entity97 did freelance audio and was headed into @entity4 to work sunday morning , said @entity104 , a town council member in the @entity106 community of @entity107
" he loved his family and did what was necessary to keep things afloat with his family
he was a great man , " said @entity104
@entity97 's wife , @entity113 , sits on @entity107 's council , and @entity104 and @entity97 were high school classmates , @entity104 said
he leaves behind three sons and a daughter from a previous marriage
" we 're just shocked
completely shocked , " @entity104 said
the @entity120 had a ridership of 15.9 million last year , with hundreds of people riding the packed trains during weekday rush hour , officials said
the train operator -- who is among the injured -- told investigators he applied brakes to the train , but it did n't slow down , a law enforcement official on the scene and familiar with the investigation said
" that will be a key point of concern , whether this train was moving too quickly , " @entity47 said
a freight train derailed in the same curve in july , damaging about 1,500 feet of track , the @entity75 reported at the time
@entity39 said the @entity8 would look into whether there was any connection between that derailment and sunday 's crash , but both he and @entity45 discounted the possibility
" the curve has been here for many , many years , right , and trains take the curve every day , 365 days a year ... we 've always had this configuration
we did n't have accidents , " @entity45 said
" so there has to be another factor , and that 's what we want to learn from the @entity8
" investigators will look at the condition of the track , the signal system , crew performance and other factors
they 'll also search for data and video recordings that may have captured details tied to the derailment , @entity8 chairwoman @entity163 said
" we 've got a lot of work to do , " she said
" we do n't have a lot of daylight hours to do it , but we 're going to do as much as we can
" passenger : @entity174 stopped with a thud the incident quickly sparked chatter on @entity178 and drew a crowd of onlookers to the scene
passenger @entity182 told @entity183 he thought the train was traveling " a lot faster " than usual
he escaped a derailed car on his own and had head and neck injuries , he said
other passengers were still on the train , he told @entity183
another survivor told @entity183 that she climbed out of a train car that had overturned
nearby , she said , she heard injured victims moaning and asking for help
" i almost feel guilty , " she said
" i was just in a really safe spot on the train , just the way it fell
" @entity25 told @entity26 the train car she was in came to a stop with a thud
" i just closed my eyes and kind of hoped to @entity204 that i was going to be able to call my mom with decent news , " @entity25 said
she got off the train with her cell phone in hand : " the screen was shattered , but it still worked , " she said
among those hurt , one suffered a spinal cord injury that could leave him paralyzed from the neck down , said dr. @entity215 , director of the emergency department at @entity217 in the @entity5
@entity218 said it was treating 17 patients , four of whom were in critical condition
federal authorities are also investigating another @entity120 incident in which two passenger trains crashed during rush hour in @entity225 in may
though no connection between the incidents has been established , one state lawmaker said sunday that the derailments are a sign that federal investigators should examine track conditions throughout the region
" it is important that the entire regional track infrastructure be examined to identify any chronic issues that have led to past derailments or could lead to future derailments in order to ensure the safety of the millions of people who use the trains every single day , " @entity235 sen. @entity234 said in a statement
service was suspended sunday on part of the @entity248 and wo n't be resumed until the @entity8 finishes documenting the scene and returns the track to the @entity75 for repairs , @entity45 said
" i think it 's fair to say tomorrow , people who use this line should plan on a long commute or plan on using the @entity257 , " @entity45 said
@entity259 trains were suspended between @entity4 and @entity260 for hours after the derailment
on sunday afternoon officials said service would resume with restricted speeds in the area
" some delays can be expected , " @entity259 said .
