capt. @entity0 was reunited wednesday with both survivors and rescuers at the scene of the remarkable emergency landing of @entity5 five years ago on the @entity6
to mark the anniversary , @entity0 , first officer @entity5 and several passengers of the 150 who were on the plane were reunited with members of the ferry crews who rescued them on january 15 , 2009
" much was saved that day , " @entity0 said at a news conference
" and it 's the efforts not only of the crew , the rescuers , and the first responders , that everyone survived
" " had even one person not survived , " he added , " i personally could n't have celebrated any of this
" five years ago , the aircraft left @entity26 and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines , forcing the crew to land in the frigid waters of the @entity6
within four minutes of landing , multiple @entity32 ferry boats , aided by the @entity33 and police from @entity35 and @entity36 , descended on the scene to rescue the 155 people on board
the complicated maneuver , which was called an " amazing piece of airmanship " by a former @entity45 director , resulted in only a few minor injuries and made heroes of the crew
passengers at the news conference thanked the rescue teams
" without these people , my children would not have had a father , my mom would n't have had a son , " @entity51 said
after the news conference , the group of survivors and rescuers boarded a boat on the @entity6 to celebrate
" we 're going to toast to life , " @entity51 said
@entity0 took time off to write a book and speak about aviation issues before returning to the cockpit in fall 2009
he also joined the airline 's flight operations safety management team
after his last flight from @entity70 , @entity71 , to @entity72 , @entity73 , in march 2010 , @entity0 said he was " chosen by circumstance " to be a spokesman for the aviation industry and plans to work independently in that role .
