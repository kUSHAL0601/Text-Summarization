as a plume of black smoke billowed from @entity3 after it crash landed at @entity5 last week , images were being captured -- not just of the plane itself , but of passengers ignoring official safety procedures and collecting their carry - on items before evacuating the aircraft
a photograph that showed several passengers , including a woman walking away from the smoking wreckage with a black suitcase and smaller white bag in her hands , has been widely circulated
the photo and reports of similar behavior have stirred up a stormy debate across @entity24 's social media platforms -- @entity24 nationals made up approximately half the passengers on the @entity28 flight that originated in @entity29 , according to the airline
" i am so disappointed those passengers think their baggage is more important than other people 's lives , " posted " @entity36 , " on @entity37 , @entity24 's @entity38 - like service
" and they had time to tweet the plane crash ( before ) helping others that are injured
" " @entity42 ( especially @entity43 ) do n't understand that in @entity24 , human lives are cheaper than money , " posted another , called " victory of @entity48
" " and this belief is deeply ingrained in the mentality of the @entity24 government and its people
" a similar tone and theme was prevalent across @entity37 but other netizens defended the passengers
" grabbing the bag is an instinct response , " wrote " @entity59
" " but as @entity24 , we should always keep in mind that human lives weigh more than our belongings
" did pilot have enough 777 experience ? communication problems ? many commenters chided passengers who did not read the aircraft 's safety briefing card or pay attention to verbal safety instructions
part of the investigation into the incident will look at @entity78 members ' verbal instructions during the emergency , what languages those instructions were in and how passengers responded
there can be no denying such an event can be chaotic and potentially confusing
according to the airline , flight attendants helped passengers get off the plane safely
they opened doors , deployed slides and helped passengers escape , according to @entity92 , a @entity93 newspaper
safety information available online from the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) emphatically capitalizes the instruction to " @entity98 " under its evacuation procedures
passengers are also instructed to : -- stay low -- proceed to the nearest front or rear exit -- count the rows between your seat and the exits -- follow floor lighting to exit -- jump feet first onto evacuation slide -- do n't sit down to slide
place arms across your chest , elbows in , legs and feet together -- remove high - heeled shoes -- exit the aircraft and clear the area -- remain alert for emergency vehicles -- never return to a burning aircraft some passengers have defended their decision to grab personal items before evacuating the burning aircraft , citing passports as a major concern
one of the most high profile passengers to do so was @entity126 , president of product development for @entity128 , the largest e-commerce platform in @entity24
" regarding some people who criticize me for taking my luggage with me and thus hindering the rescue of other passengers , i have to clarify , " wrote @entity126 on @entity37
" first , my family ( three of us ) sat in the same row , our bags were in the overhead cabin on top of our seats , we did n't stand in the aisle to take our things
" second , our passports , money , etc. , were all in ( our luggage )
i would be difficult if i did n't take it with me
" third , everyone was looking forward in the cabin at that time , it was n't too chaotic
no one was running behind us
my son said to us , ' we could get out ' ( through the hole in the aircraft , not the evacuation slide )
" shock and survival : plane crash through the eyes of children but @entity126 's explanation attracted criticism from some netizens
one , identified as " @entity163 " posted : " are you an idiot ? taking your luggage when you 're escaping ... ignorant and selfish ! ! ! you know your seemingly justifiable action may lead to the death of the others ? please read your safety manual carefully next time ! your possessions may be important to you , but even more so are the lives of others
" @entity126 's comments notwithstanding , the question remains why so many defied safety protocol -- and , perhaps , common sense -- by carrying their belongings off the plane
cabin crew well trained a @entity24 netizen named " @entity183 , " who identifies himself as a commercial airline pilot , posted his own summary
" a crew member from @entity188 complained to me that a lot of @entity24 people refuse to put on safety belts , adjust their seats or close the glare shield while the plane is landing , and they put over-weighted bags overhead
" some planes have to broadcast in @entity24 over and over again that if passengers refuse to cooperate with the crew , they will face a fine as much as $ 1,500
do n't these passengers know their bad behavior would kill them in emergency landing ? " the rush for belongings , even as potential disaster loomed , may raise questions about the way passengers are briefed for emergency situations
how does an air crash investigation work ? the news from @entity5 could have been far worse , and " what if " speculation abounds
" it 's a natural reaction in the chaos of a crash , to grab your things and run , i think , " said @entity214 , chief correspondent at @entity215
" but clearly there can be repercussions , from high heels puncturing the slide to bags blocking exits
" flight crew are trained to be extremely firm with passengers , ordering them about if necessary
it 's unlikely the crew were at fault
to get an operating license aircraft need to show they can be evacuated in 95 seconds
the problem here is with passengers ignoring safety instructions -- if we do n't comply , you could have problems
" interactive : what happened with @entity3 ? the @entity244 has yet to comment on or determine the impact passenger behavior had on overall safety and the efficiency of the evacuation effort
