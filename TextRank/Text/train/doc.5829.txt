-- walking into a @entity2 hospital room to greet her imprisoned son , @entity5 was overcome with emotion
talking exclusively to @entity0 , @entity5 said it was a " very happy moment
at the same time , i could not believe he was a prisoner in @entity9 ; a new realization
" @entity5 was granted a five - day visa to @entity9 and three short visits with her son , @entity13 ; a total of six hours , in which she says there was not one moment 's silence
" he said he 's being treated very fairly , " she said
" he was taken to a special labor camp , so he was the only prisoner , and a whole lot of people have to stay with him , guards and doctors
" bae from @entity9 prison : please help me @entity28 , an @entity29 citizen , was arrested in november of last year and sentenced in may to 15 years of hard labor
the @entity9 regime says he was found guilty of " hostile acts " and attempts to topple the government
his mother says he has a profound love for the country and its people , and any offense he caused was not intentional
" always , he wanted to help the people over there , help the country , " she said
" he always thought that way , but apparently he misunderstood their system , so a lot of things he realized -- he did some harm to their country
" @entity5 added that her son 's @entity51 faith was so strong , he wanted to convey his feelings
@entity9 is officially an atheist state and has punished missionaries in the past
although @entity5 was unable to meet with @entity9 officials to plead her son 's case , she wants to make her message to them clear : " please give him mercy and give him amnesty to send him home
we apologize as a family on his behalf , but his health can not sustain any longer if he is sent back to the labor camp again
" @entity28 , @entity29 imprisoned in @entity9 , moved to hospital @entity5 was forced to work in the camp for three months until his health deteriorated
his mother says his illnesses include diabetes , an enlarged heart , gallstones , back and neck pains , and high cholesterol
@entity5 says he looked better when she met him than he appeared in the footage of his hospitalization in august
but that brings its own concerns
" my worst fear is to send him back to the labor camp because his health seems a little bit improved , that 's my worst fear
because i do n't think his body can endure eight hours labor a day , six days a week
" previous americans detained in @entity9 have been released when high - profile visitors have traveled to the country to plead their case
most notably , former presidents @entity93 and @entity94 went on two separate occasions in 2010
@entity5 believes her son 's case has not encouraged such attention , as relations between @entity100 and @entity2 hit a new low this year
@entity5 says it has been an agonizing 11 months , not only for her , but also for @entity28 's wife and three children
" they all had a very hard time , and i think we all as a family felt helpless
we could not do anything for him , only sending letters ... we do n't have any power to bring him home
" the most heart - breaking part of the trip for @entity5 was leaving @entity2 and walking out of the hospital without her son
" it was very hard ; i can not express my pain and my heartache to leave him behind as a prisoner in @entity9
how long will it take to see him again ? "
