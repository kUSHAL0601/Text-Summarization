-- the name of @entity3 gov. @entity2 surfaced once again in the national news this week , floated by some as a possible new entrant in the ever - widening , fickle field of @entity9 presidential contenders
but @entity2 got even more attention on his own by heading straight to the " @entity12 " -- the tv show
on monday , @entity2 vetoed a $ 420,000 tax break previously granted to @entity15 's most popular program -- the highly viewed and just as highly derided reality series featuring @entity17 , @entity18 and other often inebriated free - range narcissists
in denying the show 's producers the @entity23 's 20 % tax credit on tv shows filmed or produced in the state , @entity2 said it was unjustifiable " for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens
" like a rain - slicked @entity35 boardwalk as it snakes its way to the shore , that 's some slippery ground on which @entity2 is treading
it 's difficult , maybe even impossible , to disagree with him on the position of being anti- " @entity12 " : anything that slows the spread of that video virus is , almost by definition , a good thing
but what if the same logic and political tactics had been used on , say , @entity50 's " @entity49 " ? even if that sort of concern amounts to fiscal responsibility , it also amounts to artistic irresponsibility
politicians have attacked tv before , but the attention they draw rarely has them getting the last word , or being awarded the final victory
@entity61 vs. " @entity62 " ? the @entity64 sitcom won that one , handily ; the single mother about whom @entity61 was so upset was , after all , a fictional tv character
@entity67 , in 1992 , campaigned by promising to make @entity73 families " a lot more like the @entity69 and a lot less like the @entity71
" @entity74 , one of the animated characters on " @entity71 , " retaliated almost instantly in a quickly dubbed opening credits sequence , replying , " we 're just like the @entity69
we 're praying for an end to the @entity79 , too
" @entity2 , by pulling the state purse strings tighter and refusing to hand over rebate tax credit money to tv productions that make @entity3 look bad , is wielding a heavy club
where else , after all , could " @entity12 " film its reality - show escapades ? @entity87 ? ( actually , yes
they 've done just that
but @entity15 and " @entity12 " have n't yet gone to the original @entity12 , nestled in the @entity90 and part of the @entity92
) or maybe , if @entity95 's " @entity94 " lasts another season ( which is doubtful ) , @entity2 could come on as a @entity17 " hater , " as a nonfan did to confront the " @entity12 " standout star in this month 's season premiere , and take away her show 's tax credits on camera
but really , the biggest media storm he could generate here , and the one that would score him even stronger political points , would be to make the tax credits , or the denial of them , qualitative as well as quantitative , and thus support the arts in the most measurable way possible
bear with me here : @entity2 could make it a policy to give tax rebates for the quality shows , and levy fines -- tackiness taxes , if you will -- for those that besmirch @entity3 in particular and the lively arts in general
make good tv and movies , you get money back
make bad tv and movies , you pay a surcharge
under such a system , the better the tv show or movie , the higher the tax incentives
( this works for the other arts as well : @entity138 could do whatever he wants in @entity3 , which is kind of the way things are now anyway
) conversely , the lower a visiting tv or film production sets the crassness bar , the higher the state should set the additional taxes for filming in @entity3
that way , when something as outstanding and artistic as " @entity49 " shoots on location in the @entity3 , it gets a break
the " @entity152 , " on the other hand , gets broken
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .
