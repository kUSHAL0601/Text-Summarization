-- dressed in eye - catching red costumes , a high - spirited troupe of barefoot acrobats storms across a dusty yard in the heart of @entity6 , @entity7 's capital , their grinning faces painted with bright colors
using an elaborate mix of flips , kicks and twists , the skilful performers sing and whistle as they dance their way onto a makeshift stage , while the pounding beats of skin drums and cheerful clapping summon scores of excited children from nearby neighborhoods towards the spectacle
they 're all part of the @entity26 , an uplifting project that 's aiming to transform the lives of street children and orphans in @entity7 by using performing arts as a way of engaging youths who have suffered through poverty , drug use or other traumatic issues

organizers say they are all designed to help children express themselves , gain valuable information and ultimately prevent them from living on the streets
" we engage the children with arts and theater to encourage their creativity and stimulate their curiosity , " says @entity55 , who founded @entity56 in 2006
" we help holistically to their development and we see our interventions as crucial to any child 's development -- as important as schooling , as accommodation or food
" accidental beginnings back in the mid- 2000s , @entity55 , a young artist hailing from the north of @entity71 , left @entity72 to pursue his dream of taking a one - man street show to @entity75
he embarked on his mission in @entity75 , where he spent six months before heading north
but one month into his stay in @entity78 he was mugged and without most of his belongings , @entity55 had to get to the nearest @entity71 embassy , which was in @entity6
and that 's when everything changed
" when i got here i had nothing planned , but i happened to come across a guy who was working with street kids in a center called @entity87 in @entity6 , " recalls @entity55
" so i came to do some workshops with these kids and it was absolutely incredible -- the energy , the passion , the enthusiasm and the talent that these kids had was just so infectious
" at the same time i met a group of older guys who used to stay on the streets and were living at the center , and were also artists
so we were interested in how we could collaborate and work with these children
so it started very modestly and organically with just a few workshops and blossomed from there
" read this : from the streets to break beats from those initial sessions , @entity26 has grown into a group working with thousands of children , typically aged from seven to 20 , in five cities across @entity7
the charity occupies its own office space , has a paid staff of more than a dozen people and receives funding from @entity119
the group 's members , many of whom used to live on the streets themselves , run a series of artistic modules focused on issues affecting vulnerable kids , from physical and emotional abuse to hiv / aids and other major problems
as part of their training , the children also have to work together to stage performances for their communities , using the skills and information they gained during the workshop sessions
" that 's when you can instil all the information and internalize it , " says @entity55
" and then it 's more lasting
" the group 's performances culminate in its annual @entity145 , a vibrant 10 - day event at the end of august where children from across @entity7 meet up to sing , dance and perform in front of enthusiastic onlookers
held in various locations in @entity6 , the popular get - together includes a colorful carnival procession as well as an array of performances and art exhibitions that give children a platform to showcase their talents while highlighting the dangers of life on the streets
' i thought that 's the end of my life ' in @entity7 , loss of parents , poverty and family breakdown have pushed thousands of children onto the streets
according to @entity119 data , there are 1.2 million orphans under the age of 15 in the country , 800,000 of whom are affected by @entity178 and @entity179
in many cases , children take to the streets to try to earn money for school fees or supplement their family income
exposed to cruel living conditions , many start begging and stealing while others resort to drug use
" once you get sucked into that life , it is quite hard to disengage yourself , " says @entity55
" once you 're full time in the street , you 're open to a whole world of abuse -- sexual , physical , psychological , " he adds
" it 's survival ; it 's really going from day to day trying to get food , trying to get enough money for drugs

" i was born in a family of five , of which i was the last born , " says @entity26 facilitator @entity215 , one of the group 's success stories
" my mother died when i was three months old so my dad had to marry another wife , which became my step mother
" @entity225 's step mother disowned him when he was only eight , forcing him to run away to @entity6 and fend for himself
" i got stranded , i never knew where to start from , " says @entity225 , whose drumming now accompanies the group 's energetic performances
" i was left alone , i never knew anyone -- i just felt so lost , i thought that 's the end of my life
" it all changed when @entity225 was 14 and saw the @entity26 crew for the first time
" they were just making different scowls , and they just have different energies and their stories , " he remembers
" they were advocating for children that live on the street
it gave me confidence so i can stand
" ' life - changing effects of art ' for most children living on the streets , entertainment is a rarity
that 's why the @entity26 troupe regularly pops up unannounced in low - income areas , attracting at - risk youth with their dancing , singing and drumming
the performers say the troupe sees itself as a conduit for providing help
any child in need can be connected with other ngos or local professionals able to provide care
the genius is that none of the group 's activities looks like serious work so children are more likely to play along without realizing they are being offered help
looking ahead , @entity55 says the group 's dream is to turn its festival into a global hub where youth can come to perform and collaborate with @entity7 artists , as well as share skills and experiences about issues affecting children in different parts of the world
" we want our festival in the heart of @entity75 to be a hub for other young advocates and artists across the world who can come here and see whether they can be inspired by the life - changing effects of art in our country , " says @entity55 .
