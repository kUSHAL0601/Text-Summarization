-- a south @entity3 banker accused of embezzling millions by defrauding scores of investors was captured tuesday after one and a half years on the run , authorities said
the @entity7 indicated online that 47 - year - old @entity8 -- whom it characterized as an investment adviser and former minister -- had been captured
that agency website did n't provide further details , including how @entity8 was detained or what he has been doing since june 2012
yet a @entity16 , @entity3 , sheriff 's office website showed that he was booked tuesday and is being " held for federal authorities on a charge of giving a false name , address or birth date to a law enforcement officer
" officer @entity24 said that @entity8 was being held for federal marshals
his capture ends a law enforcement saga that started in the town of @entity29 , a community of about 430 people , and stretched to include parts of @entity33 , @entity34 and the vast waters that separate them
in late 2010 , @entity8 was being celebrated by his peers and written up in newspaper articles after a company that he controlled bought a controlling portion of the troubled @entity41 in @entity29 , which is located some 170 miles southeast of @entity42
he was supposed to invest the bank 's capital
instead , prosecutors say , @entity8 used a @entity47 - based " clearing firm " -- a dummy company set up to hide money -- to cover up fraudulent wire transfers and investments
a complaint filed in federal court on july 2 , 2012 , claimed that @entity8 and others " raised approximately $ 40 million from approximately 115 investors , " mostly in @entity3 and @entity33 , beginning in 2009 , then committed fraud at the expense of those investors
" the complaint alleges that , instead of investing the money as promised , @entity8 fraudulently wired the bank 's funds to accounts that he personally controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank management with altered documents to make it appear as if he had invested the bank 's money in ( @entity69 ) treasury securities , " the @entity69 attorney 's office for eastern @entity47 said then
in sum , the complaint alleges that @entity8 hid the embezzlement by falsely stating that about $ 17 million had been deposited in the bank 's name at a @entity47 financial services firm
by the time these charges came out , @entity8 had been missing for several weeks , having told friends he had lost " a large sum of money through his trading activities , " according to the complaint
in the letter he 'd purportedly written to acquaintances and business associates that june , @entity8 indicated that he planned to kill himself by " jumping off a ferry boat " off @entity33 's coast , the complaint stated
he was spotted -- alive -- in @entity88 , @entity33 , in the middle of that month , and the @entity91 's subsequent search for his body found nothing
by then , authorities hinted they believed @entity8 was on the lam
he owns properties in @entity97 and @entity98 , and the @entity7 's wanted poster for him indicated that he also has a 17 - foot boat
the federal agency offered a reward of up to $ 20,000 for information leading to his arrest ; it was n't immediately clear if anyone will recoup that reward , nor was it known how @entity8 was taken into custody
a federal grand jury in @entity47 indicted him on wire fraud and securities fraud charges earlier this year
a conviction on the wire fraud charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 years , with a 25 - year maximum for the other charge
the bank @entity8 took over -- which had been in operation for nearly 90 years -- was closed in summer 2012 by the @entity3 , with the @entity69 @entity119 named as its receiver
@entity8 's family members have been quiet publicly since news of the charges came out
and it was not immediately clear if he has legal representation following his detention
