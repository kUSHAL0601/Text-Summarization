-- @entity4 police investigating the 2007 disappearance of @entity6 will begin digging this week in an area of wasteland close to where she went missing in @entity11 , sources close to the investigation have told @entity0
media have gathered outside a cordoned - off area of the beach resort town of @entity15 , in @entity11 's @entity16 , but it is unclear when digging will begin
@entity18 was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family 's holiday apartment on may 3 , 2007
her parents had left @entity18 and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby
her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing
@entity0 understands that @entity32 's @entity31 will be in charge of the new digging operation in abandoned terrain close to where @entity18 disappeared
a large investigation team is expected to use dogs and radar in the search and dig a number of holes , sources said
@entity11 police searched the area soon after @entity18 's disappearance , and it is understood they will intervene only if a body is found
sources told @entity0 that @entity4 police were working on the assumption that @entity18 was dead , while their @entity11 counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of @entity11 by a @entity52 national who had been in the country for a short time
@entity55 -- as @entity32 's @entity31 are known -- has not commented on the latest development , other than to confirm that @entity4 officers would be in @entity15 this week
on may 22 , its head of specialist crime and operations , assistant commissioner @entity58 , told media there would be " specific police activity " in @entity11 in the coming weeks , relating to @entity18 's disappearance
" it should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in @entity11 will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened , " he warned
" what you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation
" @entity58 said the senior investigator in the case , detective chief inspector @entity74 , and his team would be traveling to @entity11 but would not be commenting on the investigation
he reiterated that @entity11 police had advised @entity31 that they did not brief media on current investigations
" they clearly stated that if the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) provide any briefings or information on the work they are undertaking on our behalf , or if reporters cause any disruption to their work in @entity11 , activity will cease until that problem dissipates , " @entity58 said
" we have made it clear to colleagues in @entity11 that we will not be giving operational updates , " he said
" if media interfere with police work , that work will stop
" in july 2013 , @entity55 reopened its investigation into @entity18 's disappearance after a two - year review of the original probe
@entity11 police reopened their investigation last october
at the time , the @entity31 said the two police forces ' investigations would run in parallel
@entity18 's parents -- @entity109 and @entity110 -- launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter after she went missing and say they continue to believe she is still alive .
