for more than a year the @entity1 government has been bombing and spreading terror in the country 's @entity4 state , surgically cleansing the land of the @entity8 people
the government of @entity10 argues it is fighting a rebellion led by the @entity12 that engineered the secession of @entity10
@entity14 still struggles to stomach the victory of the @entity16 , brought about partly by the large number of @entity8 fighters who -- after decades of marginalization and political exclusion -- joined forces with the @entity22
accordingly , @entity14 treats the @entity8 people as the enemy within -- a foe whose independent spirit has never been tamed the cost : half a million people have been displaced or severely affected by the conflict , according to the @entity31 's @entity30 office
the most recent rash of bombings is the second time in 20 years that the @entity8 people have been targets of the same @entity14 leaders -- president @entity37 and governor @entity38
both men are internationally indicted war criminals , although both deny the charges

i traveled to @entity10 bear witness , as a journalist and a @entity54 , to a people under siege , at the war - torn border between the two @entity59 , one of the most isolated regions on earth
smuggled into the @entity63 , an area closed to the world , i filmed local activists documenting the attacks being perpetrated by the @entity14 regime
despite being bombed several times a day since june 2011 , the activists remain nonviolent
armed with cameras and the hope for a better tomorrow , they relentlessly scour their homeland collecting the testimonies , pictures and evidence to build up a case against their aggressors : their government
our team traveled to a number of villages up to 20 km from the front line
during my time in the region i experienced bombings as regimented as prison meals
we were attacked an average of three times a day
we were filming as the scale of atrocities unfolded with excruciating precision : the bombs falling , the people hiding in caves for safety , the destruction of villages , the casualties
every day , we experienced hunger , fear , abandonment , exhaustion and unspeakable harshness , like the @entity8 people do
at a moment 's notice , we jumped in and out of foxholes and crawled in caves like they do to survive
cramped , hot and terrified , we have seen and smelled the death of children , pregnant women and the elderly ; the destruction of villages , crops , schools , water pumps , mosques , churches and hospitals
in the making of " erasing the @entity8 " we were bombed 19 times and lived to tell the story of resilience of a people harassed daily by landmines and rockets , in a region transformed into ghost towns , craters and ruins

almost 63,000 @entity8 have fled to the @entity138 refugee camp in @entity10
there i saw a people left to fend for themselves , a people that know they have no friends , yet determined to face their destiny with the only thing they have left : dignity
in @entity138 , i attended a @entity149 - sponsored food distribution and saw how a 3kg ration of @entity152 - produced sorghum was distributed for each family to eat until the uncertain next round of food supply
in @entity138 , a mother begged me to take home with me her three - month - old baby , whom she had delivered squatted down under a tree on a rainy afternoon
i sat with @entity138 's oldest resident , a 101 - year - old man who journeyed on donkey back for eight days to be reunited with one of his sons
the poor man was so disoriented that he had stopped eating and talking for days at a time
his family feared that leaving him alone might drive him to commit suicide
in yida i watched children sitting on the branches of a tree to follow a mathematics class as the open - air " classroom " was packed
it struck me to see how one adult volunteer could teach a class of children , without the use of a blackboard and chalk
there is no such thing as pens or notebooks for the thousands of children in need of an education at @entity138
see also : @entity10 violence amounts to war crimes dreams for domestic reconciliation exhausted after two decades , the @entity8 are holding onto the belief that " the hearts of the international community " woven into the fabric of our shared humanity " will hear their cries
" they say they have been sacrificed at the altar of peace agreements between @entity59 and they feel cheated by the world 's inaction
" erasing the @entity8 " has captured the spirit of the @entity8 people of @entity10 , a minority bowed but not broken -- not by the daily hellish rain of bombs and rockets , nor by the world 's complicit silence
but for how much longer can they prevail -- hostages of @entity14 and us , the international community ? a group of people and their way of life is being destroyed
why are the @entity8 , the heirs of a civilization that once stretched from @entity223 to @entity224 , asked to shake hands with @entity38 , and his murderous gang of " butchers of @entity14 " ? would one have asked @entity229 nations to make peace with @entity231 ? they have been forced to crawl in caves like beasts , survive on leaves and berries only to be told of a " @entity237
" unlike @entity238 in @entity239 -- bad as he is -- only one current head of state in the world is indicted officially by a due legal process : @entity37
yet many in the world are advocating the removal of @entity238
mountains of grudges and greed fuel this conflict , where humanitarian assistance is used as a pawn on the chessboard of peace negotiations
beneath the surface , jumbles of players -- local and foreign -- are waging a merciless war against each other for the political , economic and military control of the two @entity59
there can be no peace , no security , no stability , no settlement to this conflict as long as the blood of the @entity8 children , women , men and communities will be spilled
my family falling victim to the @entity54 genocides that started in 1994 , and a commitment to uphold the vow made by those touched by genocide the world over to " never forget , " inspired me to bring their story to light
" erasing the @entity8 " is my testimony , as a @entity54 and a journalist , to ensure these people are never referred to in the past tense
