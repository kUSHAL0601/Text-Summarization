-- people living in the @entity2 are voting in a referendum on their political status on sunday and monday at a time of heightened tensions between @entity7 and @entity8 over their sovereignty
the two countries went to war over the territory , known to the @entity7 as @entity2 , in 1982 after the then - military government in @entity7 landed troops on the islands
according to the @entity2 legislative assembly , the vote is intended to affirm islanders ' desire to remain a self - governing territory of the @entity8 and to reject claims of ownership by @entity7
the question put to voters is : " do you wish the @entity2 to retain their current political status as an @entity27 of the @entity8 ? " the two - day referendum is supported by the @entity8 government
but the @entity30 in @entity31 said in a statement friday that the referendum had no legitimacy , characterizing it as " a further attempt by the @entity8 to manipulate the question of the @entity2
" because the area around the @entity2 is the subject of a sovereignty dispute , it argues , " the @entity8 has no right to alter the legal status of these territories , not even under the guise of a hypothetical ' referendum
' " @entity7 's president condemns ' colonial rule ' in january , @entity7 president @entity48 wrote an open letter , published in the @entity8 press , in which she called on @entity8 to hand back the islands and accused it of blatant colonialism
" the @entity7 on the @entity2 were expelled by the @entity53 and the @entity8 subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule , " she wrote
" since then , @entity8 , the colonial power , has refused to return the territories to the @entity7 , thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity
" she cited a 1965 @entity63 resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the @entity8 to abide by the resolution
the @entity8 government rejected @entity70 's call for negotiations , saying the @entity2 residents have chosen to be @entity8 and " have a right to self - determination as enshrined in the @entity75
" the january statement added : " there are three parties to this debate , not just two as @entity7 likes to pretend
the islanders ca n't just be written out of history
" as such , there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the @entity2 unless and until such time as the islanders so wish
" the @entity8 government accuses @entity88 of trying to " coerce " the @entity2 residents into becoming part of @entity7 through intimidation of those involved in fishing and oil exploration , and efforts to isolate the remote islands even further by limiting access by sea
long desired for its natural resources located in the @entity102 , about 480 kilometers ( 298 miles ) east of the tip of @entity101 , the @entity2 have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources , including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry
the islands , which raise their own taxes but rely on the @entity8 for defense and foreign policy , are one of 14 @entity113 and have been under @entity8 rule since 1833
more than 2,500 people from more than 60 nations live and work there , according to the islands ' government website , as well as forces stationed at the @entity8 military 's @entity120
many @entity2 residents are of @entity8 origin
@entity124 broke out over the territory in 1982 , when the then - @entity7 military government landed troops on the islands
@entity7 put its death toll from the conflict at around 645
@entity8 's civil and military losses amounted to 255
on its official website , the @entity2 government rejects as false the @entity7 government claim that a civilian population was expelled by @entity8 in 1833 and argues for the inhabitants ' right to choose their path
" the people expelled were an illegal @entity7 military garrison , who had arrived three months earlier , " it says
" the civilian population in the @entity2 , who had sought permission from @entity8 to live there , were invited to stay
all but two of them , with their partners , did so
" we are not an implanted population
our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly two hundred years
... we are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of @entity101 whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from @entity157 -- we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration
" the islands are economically self - sufficient , the government says , except for the cost of defense needed as a result of " the claim made by an aggressive neighbour
" " the @entity2 are a peaceful , hard - working and resilient people
our society is thriving and forward - looking
all we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future , and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come , " the government says
