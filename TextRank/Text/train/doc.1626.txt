-- as an estimated one billion people around the globe take part in events to mark the 42nd @entity7 , @entity2 's images provide a striking reminder of our planet 's awe - inspiring beauty and fragility as an eco-system
during a six - month mission to the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) last year , the @entity15 astronaut snapped around 26,000 images , posting daily updates on @entity20
" i really tried to capture what i was seeing
i was amazed by the response from people
it was very fulfilling for me
i was doing something which was very interesting for me , but it made me more happy that i could share the images , " @entity2 said
@entity2 explained to @entity0 what it 's like to see the world " turning around your feet " and the unique perspective space travel provides on our planet and humans ' collective impact on it
describe the view of @entity38 from space ? @entity2 : " it 's a most unreal view you have from up there
it 's look as though it 's painted
one of the things you gain up there is an appreciation of planet earth as a kind of ship
it looks like a ship flying in space
" a lot of the time you 're up there you are working so you do n't have a lot of time to look out of the window
when you do , most of the time you see oceans and clouds -- which is really nice
" but it really takes a little bit of time before you acquire a perception of where you are and what you are looking at and how to look at it in the best way
" after a month , a month and a half , something strange happens -- you look out of the window and you know where you are
you might be over @entity80 , @entity81 , you just know
it 's amazing how you just develop this
" how high does the @entity17 orbit ? @entity85 : we are 400 kilometers ( 248 miles ) above the @entity38 and fly at a velocity of 20,000 kilometers - per - hour ( 12,400 mph ) -- the equivalent of about 7.7 kilometers - per - second ( 4.8 miles - per - second )
how did traveling to space change your outlook on @entity38 ? @entity85 : " i felt like a human being , a terrestrial guy -- not an @entity15 or a @entity94
i felt like an earthling
" you get an appreciation of how delicate the planet is
you see the atmosphere which covers the @entity38 like a blanket
it looked like if i would blow on it too hard it would float away
we know if that get 's corrupted in a certain way that 's the end
" how do you think humans are affecting the planet ? @entity85 : " the impact we are having on this planet is surely microscopic when we look at one single event , but when you look at it and you repeat these events all over - a few miles across here , a few miles across there , a river here , a river there , a city here , a city there -- and it 's clear we are a major force in shaping the crust of this planet and its clear we have the capability of imparting changes
" i can not say we are bad , or that we are causing the planet to go hot or cold
we do n't have enough data
but it 's clear that we are doing things that have a huge potential of making changes
we need to understand more
it 's a risky situation with a very delicate eco-system balance which can be dramatically skewed
" thoughts on the future of space travel ? @entity85 : " i think space travel will become successful as a tourism activity
i wish everybody could go up there and see the world from a different point of view , with different eyes
" i would , for sure , send up the politicians ( some of them we should leave there ! ) to change the way they think , but i would also send up philosophers , journalists and theologians
