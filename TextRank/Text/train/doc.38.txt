-- in january , i brought my 4 - year - old daughter to @entity3 , the section of @entity6 's @entity5 reserved for egalitarian prayer without gender segregation
my husband and i , both conservative rabbis , explained to her that this sacred space once formed part of the ancient @entity14 compound , and we helped her to place a folded - up prayer note in the cracks between the stones
it was a sweet moment and one made possible by lengthy negotiations between the @entity22 government and the reform and conservative denominations of @entity25 , as well as the women 's prayer group known as @entity28
while the @entity31 authorities who govern the main plaza of the @entity5 mandate gender segregation , the agreement to create an enhanced prayer space at @entity3 allows @entity36 of all denominations to pray at the @entity5 without compromising our egalitarian beliefs
but at the end of february , the @entity39 approved an agreement between two government subsidiaries to transfer management of @entity3 to an organization of religious right - wing settlers , @entity46 , posing a new threat to the ability of liberal @entity36 to pray at this site without checking our values at the door
today , the @entity6 district court will hear a complaint by the @entity22 attorney general 's office that the @entity56 organized the transfer without authorization
@entity59 must join in this opposition
@entity46 exists in order to move @entity63 settlers into @entity65 neighborhoods of @entity6 , so as to establish facts on the ground that will obstruct any peace agreement
for this , @entity46 raises $ 6 million a year from @entity70
this money funds legal maneuvers to evict @entity65 families from their homes and the establishment of jewish settlement compound in @entity65 neighborhoods of @entity6
@entity46 also manages the @entity78 archaeological site in @entity6
leading @entity22 archaeologists have complained about the use of this site for ideological propaganda tourism
there is little question that if @entity46 takes over the archaeological park connected to @entity3 , per the current agreement , our prayer space will similarly be used as a settler propaganda mill. i recently visited @entity92 , the neighborhood that has suffered the most from @entity46 's activities
new fortresses , with @entity22 flags flapping over barbed wire barriers , now tower over the humble homes of longtime @entity99 residents
armed guards accompany the settlers wherever they go
those who argue that @entity36 must be permitted to move into any area of @entity6 must understand : this is not a question of diversifying the neighborhood
it 's a hostile takeover
it is aimed at ensuring that @entity6 will never become part of a @entity65 state and , in fact , that no such state will ever come to be
the @entity114 and @entity115 movements , as well as @entity28 , responded swiftly and furiously to the announcement that @entity46 may take control of @entity3 in a strongly worded joint statement , they argued that an @entity31 organization can not be trusted to maintain the area as a place for egalitarian prayer
the very suggestion that an @entity31 group would manage the prayer space reserved for @entity130 prayer reveals how tone - deaf some sectors of the @entity22 government have become to the voices of @entity59 , the vast majority of whom believe that men and women should be equal in prayer as in other parts of life
but the danger of transferring power to @entity46 goes far beyond the question of who may pray where
this organization seems to have little stake in the debate over egalitarian prayer and in fact has announced its intent to respect existing agreements
more concerning is the possibility that those of us committed to egalitarian prayer at the @entity5 will end up supporting the expansion of settlements and the erosion of the peace process through our donations and entrance fees
the endless negotiations over religious pluralism in @entity22 have exposed the fissure between @entity59 , who are @entity22 's greatest financial and political supporters , and the @entity22 religious establishment
on issues such as the right of women to lead services at the @entity5 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity169 and even @entity31 @entity170 @entity36 have been willing to issue strong statements and even protest at the @entity22 embassy
the current crisis over ceding control of an egalitarian prayer space to an organization of right - wing settlers has blown apart the delusion that @entity63 leaders can criticize @entity22 on issues of religious pluralism while staying away from criticisms of settlement policy
the two are too deeply intertwined
rejecting the @entity31 hegemony that has placed the main plaza of the @entity5 off - limits to egalitarian prayer services also means loosening the grip of settlers on @entity22 politics .
