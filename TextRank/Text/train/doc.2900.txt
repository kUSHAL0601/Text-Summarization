-- @entity1 came from behind to deny @entity2 on an emotional day as @entity3 paid tribute to the 96 victims of the @entity7 disaster
@entity9 's 81st minute penalty gave sir @entity11 's men all three points against a @entity2 side which played for most of the game with ten men
@entity16 was shown a straight red card in the 39th minute following a two - footed tackle on @entity19
and although @entity2 captain @entity22 gave the hosts a 46th minute lead , goals from @entity21 and @entity9 won it for @entity1
football 's most poisonous rivalry ? @entity2 and @entity1 's tempestuous past on a day where the rivalry between @entity33 's two most successful clubs was put aside , fans and players of both teams paid their respects to the 96 supporters who died at @entity7 in 1989
shirts , flowers and cards adorned the @entity3 by the permanent memorial to the victims who perished 23 years ago
both sets of players wore the number 96 as they emerged from the tunnel with @entity1 legend sir @entity45 presenting former @entity2 striker @entity46 a bouquet of flowers
@entity50 captain @entity22 and his @entity1 counterpart @entity51 then released 96 balloons into the @entity3 sky
fans held up mosaics around the ground as @entity2 's traditional anthem of ' @entity58 ' was played
@entity33 offer apology on @entity7 @entity60 and @entity61 put aside their personal differences and shook hands in the lead up to kick off
@entity2 striker @entity60 was banned for eight matches by the @entity66 after racially abusing the @entity67 during a league game at @entity3
but while the pre-match atmosphere was full of respect , the intense rivalry between the two sides was never far away
once the game had started , both sets of fans began to goad each other , with a small section of @entity1 fans singing , ' where 's you famous @entity80 song ? ' panel : police at fault in response to deadly @entity87 stadium football crush that was a small blot on an emotional and entertaining afternoon as both teams produced the kind of cut and thrust football that makes these derby games so thrilling
@entity2 , without a league victory under new manager @entity95 this season , came out firing on all cylinders as it looked to take the game to @entity1
both @entity22 and @entity60 had opportunities as the home side dominated possession
but the game was turned on its head six minutes before the break when referee @entity104 showed @entity16 a straight red card
down to ten men , the hosts re-grouped at half - time and grabbed the lead within a minute of the restart
@entity111 tricked his way into the @entity1 penalty area and picked out the unmarked @entity22 , who volleyed home from close - range
it was a poignant moment for @entity22 , whose 10 - year - old cousin @entity117 was among 96 victims
that goal sparked an outpouring of emotion from the @entity122 as the @entity2 players celebrated in front of their supporters
but their joy was cut short as @entity1 hit back almost immediately with @entity21 curling home a spectacular equaliser from inside the penalty area
the visitors continued to make the most of their numerical advantage and were awarded a penalty when @entity134 went down under minimal contact from @entity111
@entity136 , who missed his last spot kick during the recent win at @entity139 , made no mistake this time as he beat @entity141
@entity142 wasted a late chance to equalize for @entity2 as @entity1 held out for victory .
