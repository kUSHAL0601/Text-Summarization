-- @entity2 's @entity1 successfully entered @entity4 ' orbit wednesday morning , becoming the first nation to arrive on its first attempt and the first @entity9 country to reach the @entity4
" we have gone beyond the boundaries of human enterprise and human imagination , " declared @entity2 's prime minister @entity10 , who watched from the space agency 's nerve center in @entity13
" we have accurately navigated our spacecraft through a route known to a very few
" the staff at the @entity21 erupted into applause and cheers after learning that the @entity1 , also known as @entity1 , reached the planet 's orbit and made history
before wednesday , only the @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 have successfully sent spacecraft to @entity4
" the odds were stacked against us , " @entity10 said
" of the 51 missions attempted so far , a mere 21 had succeeded
" and @entity2 reached @entity4 with significantly less money
with a price tag of $ 74 million , the @entity1 cost a mere fraction of the $ 671 million @entity36 spent on its @entity38 spacecraft , which arrived to @entity4 earlier this week
some space observers noted that @entity2 's @entity4 orbiter cost less than the $ 100 million budget for the space thriller film " gravity
" interactive : exploring @entity4 from @entity45 to @entity38 " it shows how optimal is the design , that way we 're able to cut cost and we 're not compromising quality , " said @entity46 , a space expert based in @entity13
the groundbreaking @entity4 mission was n't without controversy -- with some critics who said @entity2 should spend the money on other issues
the spacecraft launched on november 5 , and has traveled over 650 million kilometers to enter @entity4 orbit
its mission is to orbit the @entity4 , mapping its surface and studying the atmosphere
the @entity1 kicked off its interplanetary debut with its own @entity68 account
the mission has been freighted with patriotic significance for @entity2 since its inception and is seen as a symbolic coup over its rival , @entity74 , which is also ramping up its space ambitions
@entity74 's joint mission with @entity77 in 2011 , which contained the @entity74 @entity4 satellite @entity79 - 1 , stalled and eventually fell back to @entity80
@entity82 's 1998 attempt with the spacecraft @entity84 was also unsuccessful due to fuel problems
once nears @entity4 ' orbit , @entity2 's spacecraft had to execute a series of complicated and critical maneuvers
about half of all spacecraft sent on missions to the planet have veered off course , malfunctioned or crashed
@entity2 's @entity1 is in the company of @entity36 's two @entity4 rovers on the ground , a @entity28 orbiter and @entity36 orbiters including the @entity38 , which has been there since sunday
the @entity27 has expressed interest in cooperating with @entity2 as their spacecraft gather data about the planet
@entity36 congratulated @entity2 via @entity68
as did @entity105 , the @entity4 rover .
