-- cases of @entity5 virus are up 25 % over the past week and are expected to rise further over the next several weeks , the @entity2 @entity1 said wednesday
as of tuesday , 1,993 reported cases of @entity5 virus have been reported in humans , including 87 deaths
last week , the @entity1 said there were 1,590 cases with 66 deaths
" as we expected , the number of humans with west nile virus disease continues to rise in the @entity2 , " said dr. @entity11 , director of the @entity1 's @entity12
" we expect this increase to continue for the next several weeks , probably until october
" the number of @entity5 cases is the highest reported to the @entity1 through the first week in september since 1999 , when the mosquito - borne virus was first detected in the @entity2
fast facts on @entity5 virus more than 70 % of cases are in six states : @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , officials said
@entity26 bears the brunt of the outbreak , with nearly 45 % of cases
wednesday 's briefing focused on how @entity36 may have affected the outbreak and how @entity26 is managing its high number of cases
" as of now , 2012 is the worst year in the state of @entity26 for @entity5 disease , " said dr. @entity40 , commissioner of the @entity41
he says that before this , 2003 was the worst year for the virus
although @entity11 did not give any specific numbers associated with states affected by @entity36 , he stressed that the @entity1 is working with state and local officials in those areas to offer assistance on managing infestations
experience with natural disasters such as hurricanes has shown that @entity5 cases do not tend to increase in their wake , he said
however , people who spent more time outdoors because they were displaced from their homes or during recovery efforts may be more likely to contract the virus
who 's at risk for @entity5 virus ? aerial spraying has sometimes been used to control mosquitoes after hurricanes , @entity11 said
in @entity26 , spraying has been effective in areas that utilized it , @entity40 said
a 93 % reduction was seen in the density of mosquitoes in areas that received two consecutive sprays , he said
unsprayed areas showed increases in virus - carrying mosquitoes , and places that were not sprayed consecutively showed smaller reductions in mosquitoes
protection against mosquito bites is the best defense against @entity5 virus , @entity11 said
he recommended wearing long pants and sleeves during dusk and dawn -- prime mosquito times -- to prevent bites
in addition , he said , wear insect repellent when you go outdoors ; install or repair screens on doors and windows ; use air conditioning if possible ; empty standing water from outdoor containers and objects that collect water ; and support local mosquito control programs .
