-- @entity1 is just two goals behind @entity4 's international total of 34 after guiding @entity5 ever closer to qualifying for next year 's @entity7 in @entity8
the four - time @entity9 netted from the penalty spot as @entity5 eased to a 3 - 0 win over @entity12 as it remained four points clear at the top of the @entity16 group
@entity18 's @entity17 scored twice to take him to 10 goals for the qualifying campaign , but it was @entity1 who stole the show once again
the 25 - year - old has repeatedly vowed to win the one prize to have eluded him so far in his astonishing career - the @entity7
not since 1986 when @entity4 led @entity5 to glory has the country won the tournament -- a statistic that @entity1 is desperate to change
after an incredible 2012 where he scored 91 goals for club and country , surpassing the previous record of 85 by @entity38 's @entity37 , @entity1 looks set to break new ground once again
this season alone he has scored 61 goals in 51 matches for club and country with 55 of those coming in 43 matches for @entity45 and six in eight appearances for @entity5
@entity1 still has a way to go until he passes @entity49 , who holds @entity5 's all - time record with 56 goals from 78 matches
but his priority is success in @entity8 next year -- a target which is looking eminently possible
" we have a forward line that can be considered among the best in the world , " @entity5 coach @entity56 told reporters
" @entity12 are a tough team , very compact , who know what they want
what happened was that @entity5 played very well , especially in the first half and were very superior
" @entity1 will hope to move past @entity4 on tuesday when @entity5 head to the high altitude city of @entity70 to face a @entity72 side which won its last meeting between the two 6 - 1
elsewhere , @entity74 looks set to end its 16 - year wait to play in a @entity7 after thrashing @entity72 5 - 0
@entity76 gave @entity74 a first half lead with @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 all scoring after the break
@entity84 's side is four points adrift of leader @entity5 but has played a game less
@entity89 's @entity88 hit his eighth goal of the qualifying campaign to help @entity92 secure a 1 - 1 draw against @entity94 to leave it in fourth position
@entity96 , which has not played at a @entity7 since 1982 , remains in the hunt following a 1 - 0 win against @entity99 following @entity101 's strike .
