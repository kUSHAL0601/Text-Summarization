@entity1 authorities in the northern state of @entity3 have made a grisly find in one of their police stations : dozens of human body parts
contract workers made the discovery in the city of @entity12 , around 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) southwest of @entity13
while cleaning a disused part of a city police station late last week , the workers chanced upon sacks filled with human remains in a room that had been locked for a long time
until 2008 , the room was used as a mortuary , where bodies were kept before funerals , @entity23 , an additional superintendent of police for @entity24 , told @entity4
in mid- 2008 , he said , the mortuary was shifted to an area hospital
" these body parts were to be shifted to the district hospital mortuary , but we do n't know how they have since been kept here in the police station , " he said
" an investigation is still ongoing
" foul play is not suspected , officials say , but they are not sure why the bodies were not disposed of properly
in @entity37 and some other @entity1 faiths , funerals are usually conducted by cremation
officials say the bodies are likely to be at least 20 years old
another police official said that dna testing would be conducted on the remains
opposition lawmakers have called for an in - depth investigation
@entity47 state legislator @entity46 told the @entity48 that his party " will take up the issue with the chief minister and organize a movement on this issue
" the discovery comes two weeks after around 80 skeletons and decayed bodies surfaced in the @entity57 , @entity1 's holiest river , in the district .
