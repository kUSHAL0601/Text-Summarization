the first @entity1 opened in 1971 , in @entity12 , @entity13
the name comes from @entity16 's @entity15 , a classic @entity18 novel about the 19th century whaling industry
the seafaring name seems appropriate for a store that imports the world 's finest coffees to the cold , thirsty people of @entity12
@entity25 joined @entity1 in 1982
while on a business trip in @entity27 , he visited @entity29 's famous espresso bars and was impressed with their popularity and culture
in the 1990s the demand for high quality coffee allowed @entity1 to expand beyond @entity12 , first to the rest of the @entity18 , then further afield
after becoming one of the first companies to offer stock options to its part - time employees , @entity1 became a publicly traded company
