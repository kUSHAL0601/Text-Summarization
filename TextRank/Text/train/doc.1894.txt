-- on monday , @entity1 , 76 , of @entity2 announced that he will soon abdicate the throne , passing the crown to his son @entity5 , who is 46
explaining his decision to his @entity2 subjects , @entity1 noted that his son will help " open a new era of hope which combines the experience and momentum of a new generation
" last year , queen @entity14 , 75 , of the @entity15 , abdicated the throne , also passing the crown to her eldest son
explaining her decision to her @entity15 subjects , she said , " it was not because the office was too heavy for me , but because the responsibility for this country should lie in the hands of a new generation
" for those wondering why @entity28 , an octogenarian , has n't made a similar concession to youth , one has to realize that the modern @entity32 monarchy is founded on a different set of principles
as much as @entity32 might enjoy a change of pace at @entity38 , something faster and fresher , the monarchy in @entity32 is not about novelty
it 's about staying the course , resolve , and perseverance
indeed in a culture similar to ours that places a premium on youth and beauty , the @entity32 monarchy stands out as one of those rare institutions where aging , with all of its complications and humiliations , is allowed to -- and expected to -- take place in full public view
consider @entity57 , who reigned from 1760 until his death in 1820 at the age of 81
beginning in 1788 , the king suffered periodic bouts from what was likely porphyria , a metabolic disorder affecting the nervous system
by 1810 , he was permanently insane
blind and infirm , @entity57 spent the last 10 years of his reign doddering about in @entity38
admittedly , @entity57 's son , the future @entity68 , served as regent for most of this difficult period
queen @entity71 , @entity57 's granddaughter , similarly reigned from 1837 until her death , also at the age of 81 , in 1901 -- despite suffering a host of ailments in later years , including failing eyesight , insomnia and rheumatism
yet both monarchs were perhaps more popular in their oldest age than ever before
@entity57 survived the loss of the @entity83 colonies and the scandals surrounding his alleged madness to win the intense loyalty of most of his subjects
following his 1809 @entity89 , a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of a monarch 's rule , the @entity88 proudly proclaimed that the event had been " celebrated by all ranks of people in this great metropolis , in a manner worthy of an aged and venerable @entity1 , and a loyal and enlightened nation
" and queen @entity71 overcame early skepticism about her capabilities -- and a dramatic curtailment in support during the 1860s , when she retreated from public view to mourn the death of her husband , @entity106 -- to become the " great white queen , " and the " grandmother of @entity109
" at her 60th anniversary @entity111 in 1897 , @entity71 was feted like no sovereign before her
she may have only been able to offer a feeble wave from her carriage as she passed by throngs of well - wishers on her way to @entity118 , but her symbolic weight could not be overestimated
the current @entity32 monarch follows in her predecessors ' footsteps
when the young @entity28 received word in february 1952 , while traveling abroad in @entity124 , that her father @entity125 had passed away , she rushed home knowing that the title she had just inherited would be hers until death
" by the sudden death of my dear father i am called to assume the duties and responsibilities of sovereignty , " the 25 - year old queen explained to her privy councilors back in @entity132
" my heart is too full for me to say more to you today than i shall always work , as my father did throughout his reign , to advance the happiness and prosperity of my peoples , spread as they are all the world over
" when @entity28 said " i shall always work , " she meant it
more than 60 years later , at the age of 88 , the @entity28 maintains an active schedule and is the patron of more than 600 charities and organizations
add to this the fact that @entity28 's reign , like those of her predecessors , has only seemed to improve with age , at least if measured by public approval ratings -- shortly before the @entity159 in 2012 , the market research company @entity152 determined that support for the monarchy among adults in @entity32 is at an all - time high -- and there 's little reason to think that @entity28 will leave her post anytime soon
much as prince @entity167 and prince @entity168 may grow tired of waiting in the wings , a @entity166 could well take place in 2022
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .
