@entity0 -- the @entity2 will report thursday the highest level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years ago , @entity1 has learned
the @entity2 is expected to announce a new effort to study soldier suicides and links to post-combat stress
statistics obtained by @entity1 show that the @entity2 will report 128 confirmed suicides last year and an additional 15 suspected suicides in cases under investigation among active - duty soldiers and activated @entity17 and reserves
the confirmed rate of suicides was 20.2 per 100,000
@entity2 officials were reviewing the suspected suicides wednesday
if any of them are confirmed , the rate will rise
in 2007 , the @entity2 reported 115 confirmed suicides , the highest level since 1980 , when it began tracking suicides
the @entity2 is expected to announce a new effort to study the problem and determine why its suicide - prevention programs appear not to be working , and the extent to which post-combat stress may be a contributing factor
many of the suicides occur after troops return home
the @entity2 has long cited personal stress -- including financial , relationship and substance - abuse problems -- as the major reason for suicides , but it is also studying the extent to which deployments to a war zone may play a role
last month , @entity2 officials said the nation 's suicide rate was 19.5 people per 100,000 , a 2005 figure considered the most recent
military officials have long said it is difficult to compare the military suicide rate with that of the private sector because of demographic differences and overall human stress factors
another factor is that military suicides tend to be young men with access to weapons
suicides for @entity65 were also up in 2008
@entity65 had 41 suicides in 2008 , up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006 , according to a @entity65 report the numbers did not surprise @entity69 , whose 23 - year - old son , @entity70 -- a @entity65 -- hanged himself on june 22 , 2004 -- 11 months after returning from @entity71
the night before , " @entity70 asked if he could sit in my lap and if we could rock , " @entity70 said
" it was about 11:30 at night
and i rocked him for about 45 minutes
now here you have a 23 - year - old , 150 - pound @entity65 that i 'm just rocking and his therapist said it was his last gasp
it was his last place for refuge , and then the next time i held him in my lap was when i was taking him down from the rafters
he had put the hose around his neck double - looped and he was dead
" he said his son had not been able to get the treatment he needed from the @entity87
" what is disappointing is that the intervention does n't appear to be there at the present time , " he told @entity1 in a telephone interview from his home in western @entity90
the government settled with the family for $ 350,000
" the foolish part of all this is we just wanted someone to say they did wrong , " he said
" but no one would until recently
" @entity70 said the @entity104 attorney , acting on behalf of the @entity87 , told him his son 's case had led the @entity87 mental system to be changed
fear of stigma also may have played a role in making his son reluctant to seek professional help
his son , @entity70 said , was afraid that getting mental help would affect his chances of getting a job as a state trooper
" a year after he died , they accepted him , " the father said
