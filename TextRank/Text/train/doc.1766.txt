it started like any other of @entity3 's 400 days in captivity
the @entity6 journalist , held in an @entity8 prison since december 2013 , was exercising when the prison warden beckoned him over and told him that he needed to get ready to leave
" pack your stuff , " he was told
confused , he asked the warden what he meant -- was he being transferred to another prison ? " he said : ' you 're going ... the embassy 's coming , they 'll be here in an hour , so get your stuff and go , ' " @entity3 told his network , @entity15 , in an interview with correspondent @entity17 in @entity18
" i ca n't tell you that real mix of emotions that was boiling inside , " said @entity3
" it 's a relief and excitement but also real , real stress at having to say goodbye to my colleagues and friends , the people who have really become family inside that prison
" read more : freed @entity15 journalist is ' safe , healthy and very happy , ' family says having experienced " an awful lot of false starts with this , and an awful lot of false alarms , " @entity3 had n't wanted to set his faith in the @entity8 system until he was safely out of the country
but once he had his " backside into a seat on the plane , " the relief was palpable
however , his joy was tempered by the fact he was leaving behind fellow @entity15 journalists , @entity52 and @entity53
all three were convicted of supporting the banned @entity54 , but have maintained their innocence
in addition , another seven were convicted in absentia alongside the journalists
" i feel incredible angst about my colleagues , leaving them behind , " said @entity3
" amidst all of this relief i still feel a sense of concern , a real sense of worry because ... if it 's right for me to be free , then it 's right for all of them to be free
" after spending more than a year in such close proximity -- " in a box " -- @entity3 says deep bonds were forged , making " the moment of walking out of that prison , saying goodbye to those guys " much more conflicted
" over that period i 've got to know them ... as family , " he said
" they 're my brothers
it could n't be any other way
" still , he says that his release is a positive step , and he hopes that it signals a change in direction from the @entity8 government
" the sense of euphoria , of optimism is so overwhelming , " @entity3 said
" what 's very clear is that ... for @entity8 too this is a big step forward
i think everyone has acknowledged that this is a very important moment and i just hope @entity8 keeps going down this path with the others
" @entity93 , an @entity94 senior correspondent who was sentenced in absentia in @entity3 's trial , spoke to @entity1 's @entity97 about the possible release of the network 's @entity100 bureau chief @entity99
@entity52 had needed to take the drastic measure of renouncing his @entity8 citizenship in his bid for freedom , she said
" he has now renounced that citizenship , " she said
" he was really coerced to do so
he was told by the @entity8 authorities that if this was going to happen he was going to have to give away his @entity8 passport
" it represented an extreme step for the journalist , who came " from a very patriotic , proud military family , " she said
" this is a big deal for him
this is n't just a question of saying , ' oh well
i 'll just take a @entity120 passport and that 'll be that
' " now we 're getting quite a lot of diplomatic messages through that it sounds like really his release is very imminent and he is pretty soon hopefully going to be on a plane headed to @entity120
" meanwhile , @entity3 's parents spoke to @entity1 's @entity129 about his release
his mother , @entity130 , says that they initially were n't sure that the email that informed them of his release could be trusted
" it was pretty difficult to take it in , that this was really going to happen , " she said
" but then a couple of hours later we got a call from @entity3 to say that he in the airport and about to hop onto the plane
" his father , @entity141 , confirmed that his son 's release was a wholly unexpected development
" he was just as surprised as anybody that he was asked to pack his small amount of gear and be ready to leave , " he said , smiling
and now he 's free ? " @entity141 suggested i put him over my knee and give him a whack , " said his mother , laughing
but , she conceded , " foreign correspondents have a habit " of worrying their parents .
