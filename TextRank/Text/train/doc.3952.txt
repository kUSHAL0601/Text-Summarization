@entity0 -- in my @entity1 column last week , i wrote that the first thing a candidate running for office needs to know about @entity8 voters is that they value nothing more than respect
here 's the second thing : it 's not respectful to lump together latino @entity15 citizens with @entity8 illegal immigrants
not all @entity17 in the @entity15 arrived here five minutes ago
in fact , some of us come from families who have been here for five generations
and there are those in the state of @entity26 who can trace their roots in the @entity28 back several hundred years
this message is not getting through
just look at the comments posted at @entity1 in response to my column , which was about @entity8 citizens who can vote
many readers thought that i was demanding respect for illegal immigrants who ca n't vote : " how about the illegals start respecting our laws first off ? then we 'll talk
" -- @entity40 " i will respect them once they stop stealing money and jobs from the @entity15 citizen ... @entity47 ( sic ) they need to go back to @entity26 ... leave now and you may get a little respect , until then you are the enemey ( sic ) of the american ( sic ) worker and taxpayer ! ! ! ! ! " -- @entity52 " i have zero respect for the arrogant , self centered , disrespectful display of illegal foreigners marching and yelling - in @entity57 - in the streets of my country demanding my rights that they have not earned and are not entitled to ! " - for " want respect ? earn it by obeying the laws of our country , even the immigration laws ! " -- robbery in my e-mail in - box , there was more of the same : " @entity70 is something one earns
the @entity8 voter needs to respect this country and not use it as an @entity74 to send money to their families in @entity26
latino voters need to speak and understand the @entity80 language because that is how business is transacted
latino voters need to respect the rules and laws in this country and not demand bilingual education and ballots and drivers manuals in @entity57 ... " - @entity90 " are you saying that because @entity17 contribute to the economy , deserve respect and are family - centric , everything else does n't matter , even if they are here illegally ? ... this is the issue i see coming up with some who advocate for illegal immigrants : a lack of respect for our country 's laws ...
" -- @entity105 " in response to your recent @entity1 articles , i am 100 % against everything you stand for ... i do n't respect illegals , and i certainly want our president , weak as he may be , to continue to deport each and every illegal and every child of every illegal
drivers licenses and tuition for illegals ? ! ... you 're in my country
if you want respect , adapt to our ways ... " - @entity124 i 'm always amazed when i see comments like these
people are pretty worked up over the growth of the @entity8 community and the role that immigration played in fueling it
many of them can talk your ear off about that
and yet , not many of them seem to know any flesh - and - blood @entity17
if they did , they would know how ridiculous it is to treat @entity15 citizens and illegal immigrants as if they are one and the same
besides , they seem to put a lot of stock in what it means to be an @entity15
so should n't they be able to recognize @entity15 when they see them ? there is some good news , though
some readers figured out the difference between @entity8 citizens and illegal immigrants and tried to explain it to others : " just for the record , not every @entity8 in @entity15 is illegal
please stop combining us with the minority that came here illegally
i 'm sick of being told off for ' being illegal ' just because i 'm @entity161
my family has been here since the 1600s thank you very much
longer than most people 's families that tell me to ' go back to @entity26
' @entity169 is n't it ? " - @entity171 ah , yes
in the 20 years that i 've written about immigration , i 've been told that hundreds of times
i do n't suppose it has anything to do with being @entity176 ? apparently , i 'm not the only one hearing it
someone has even taken the experience and put it to music
the result is a profound and provocative song called " @entity183 " from one of my favorite @entity186 bands , @entity187
it goes like this : " they have shouted at me a thousand times that i should go back to my country ... because there 's no room for me here ... i want to remind the gringos : i did n't cross the border , the border crossed me ... and they can call me " invader
" that 's a very frequent mistake ... if we take into account centuries ... even if it bothers our neighbors ... we are more @entity15
. than all of the gringos ... " noting that " @entity15 " is actually made up of three continents and not just one , the lyrics declare that -- in reality -- @entity186 have been " @entity15 " longer than the descendants of @entity213 immigrants
in that sense , @entity186 immigrants to the @entity15 are more @entity15 than the folks trying to keep them out
if that sounds harsh , then so be it
a song like this is born of anger , frustration and righteous indignation
imagine being treated like a second - class citizen on your own home turf
i was born in the @entity15
the same goes for my parents , three grandparents , and half of my great - grandparents
and i 'm supposed to " go back to @entity26 " ? what ? you mean on vacation ? great idea
@entity237 is lovely this time of year
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240
