the trial of the son of former @entity3 leader @entity2 and dozens of other former regime officials resumed in @entity5 on sunday , in continued defiance of the @entity7 that last week rejected @entity3 's plea to try @entity9 domestically
@entity9 , once his father 's heir apparent , has been held in the western mountain city of @entity13 by the militiamen who captured him in 2011
the group has refused to hand him over to the central government , citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital
he appeared via videolink from a courthouse in @entity13 , while more than 20 former officials were in the south @entity5 courtroom
eight other former regime members being held in @entity26 also appeared on a videolink
the officials are facing charges relating to the 2011 revolution and attempts to suppress the uprising , including the killing of protesters , a crime punishable by death
the fourth session of the trial comes less than a week after the @entity7 's appeals chamber upheld an earlier decision by the international court demanding that @entity3 hand over @entity9 to the @entity43
@entity3 submitted put in a legal request to try @entity9 domestically in 2012 , but it was rejected by the @entity7 last year and later appealed by the @entity46 country
wednesday 's decision by the @entity7 appeals chamber is a final
the @entity7 had indicted both @entity9 and former spy chief @entity50 for alleged war crimes in 2011
@entity52 , who was extradited to @entity3 from @entity53 two years ago , also appeared in court on sunday , looking frail and as if he had lost weight
although the international court granted @entity3 the right to try @entity50 last year , his @entity7 - appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling
@entity3 has insisted that unlike under the @entity9 regime , the defendants will receive a fair trial
but rights groups have raised concerns about the ongoing trial , especially the use of videolink that they say does not allow them to communicate with their lawyers before and during sessions
other concerns include limited access of some defendants to legal counsel , and some defendants still have no lawyers
during sunday 's session @entity9 still did not have a court - appointed lawyer , and @entity50 's attorney was absent
without the presence of defense lawyers , the two did not enter a plea or respond to charges read by the judge
the other defendants denied the charges
some of them became emotional as they addressed the court
@entity91 , the former head of foreign intelligence , denied the charges calling them " fabricated " and " politically motivated
" the trial was adjourned to june 22 after the prosecution and defense attorneys requested more time to prepare their cases
@entity3 's government , which has been in the midst of its worst political and security crisis since the revolution , has not yet commented on the @entity7 's latest decision
legal experts say the country could face consequences for its refusal to hand over @entity9 to @entity43 , but only if steps are taken by the international community
" sanctions can be imposed on @entity3 by the @entity112 for @entity3 's non-compliance , and @entity3 's membership in various international organizations could be suspended and / or made conditional on @entity3 surrendering @entity116 to the @entity7 , if states wish to insist on it , " @entity109 , @entity9 's @entity7 - appointed defense lawyer , told @entity110 on saturday
" therefore the matter is in the hands of the international community , in particular states like the @entity122 and @entity123 , which are both members of the @entity7 and permanent members of the @entity112
" @entity109 insisted that @entity3 must hand @entity9 over to the @entity7 , saying his rights have been " gravely violated " since his capture more than two years ago
violations include @entity9 being held in solitary confinement in a secret location and being denied visits by friends and family , according to @entity109
" @entity3 is paralyzed and unable to protect the rights and security of @entity3 , including judges , lawyers and judicial police and detainees , much less the rights of a person like mr. @entity9 , " @entity109 said
@entity142 and @entity143 , who have also raised concerns about the deteriorating security situation in the country , have also renewed their call for @entity3 to hand over @entity9 to @entity43
" the @entity7 appeals decision only reinforces @entity3 's long overdue obligation to surrender @entity116 to @entity43 , " said @entity149 , international justice director
" @entity3 authorities should show the same respect for @entity7 procedures as they did when they first engaged the court on @entity9 's case
" crowds rally in @entity3 to support retired general 's campaign @entity3 : why it 's all gone so badly wrong
