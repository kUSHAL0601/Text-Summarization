@entity0 -- @entity4 's ceo wrote two days before @entity5 died that a doctor @entity5 was seeing " scares us to death because he is shooting him up with something , " court testimony shows
@entity4 ' e-mail could contradict his earlier testimony that he had no idea @entity5 was getting prescription drugs while he was preparing for his comeback concerts
@entity4 is on the witness stand for a fifth day tuesday in the @entity5 wrongful death trial , which is in its seventh week
@entity20 judge @entity19 sent jurors out of the courtroom at one point monday afternoon so she could lecture @entity4 about arguing with @entity5 lawyer @entity24 and appearing to evade his questions
" arguing with the lawyers is not going to help , " @entity19 told @entity4
" it 's not going to help your case
it 's not going to help anybody
it 's lengthening your testimony
" @entity5 's mother and three children are suing @entity4 , saying the concert promoter is liable in @entity5 's death because it hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity38 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter
@entity4 and other @entity4 executives ignored " red flags " that should have alerted them that @entity5 's health was at risk as they pressured him and his doctor to stop missing rehearsals as the " @entity48 " tour premiere approached in the summer of 2009 , @entity5 lawyers argue
@entity5 , not @entity4 , chose and controlled @entity38 , company lawyers argue
although they negotiated a contract to pay @entity38 $ 150,000 a month to attend to @entity5 , it was never fully executed because @entity5 died before they signed , they say
@entity4 executives -- including co-ceo @entity56 , who had managed @entity5 's last two tours -- had no way of knowing that @entity5 was abusing drugs , especially the surgical anesthetic propofol , which the coroner ruled played the largest role in his death , @entity4 lawyers argue
@entity38 told investigators he was infusing propofol into @entity5 nearly every night to treat his insomnia so @entity5 would be rested for rehearsals
on monday , @entity24 confronted @entity4 about an e-mail exchange that he had two days before @entity5 's death in which @entity4 was asked if dr. @entity69 was " on the list of doctors that will help get us from today to the opening night
" " he scares us to death because he is shooting him up with something , " @entity4 replied
@entity79 , who was @entity5 's business manager , shared with @entity4 that @entity69 's office sent him a $ 48,000 bill for @entity5 's frequent visits to his @entity84 dermatology clinic in the months before his death
@entity69 's invoice said @entity5 had been treated with @entity87 , @entity88 and unidentified drug injections , @entity79 wrote to @entity4
" there were a lot of bills for injections , i did n't know what it was , " @entity4 said in his deposition before the trial
@entity69 or his staff injected @entity5 with 6,500 milligrams of @entity98 during the last three months of his life , according to documents and testimony at @entity38 's criminal trial
" since we owe him $ 48k and he wants payment , maybe i should stop paying him so he would stop shooting him up , " @entity79 told @entity4
" i have the details of what he is doing
" it was unclear why @entity79 would share @entity5 's medical records with an @entity4 executive since the company 's lawyers insist they were not involved with and did not pry into @entity5 's health care
@entity4 ' testimony differs from @entity1 interview @entity4 met with @entity5 , dr. @entity38 and show director @entity117 on june 20 , 2009 , after production manager @entity118 sent an e-mail to producers titled " trouble at the @entity122
" " i have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks
he was able to do multiple 360 spins back in april
he 'd fall on his ass if he tried now , " @entity118 wrote about @entity5
@entity117 sent @entity5 home from a rehearsal the night before because of his strange behavior
" he was a basket case and @entity117 was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage , or worse yet -- get hurt , " @entity118 wrote
" the company is rehearsing right now , but the doubt is pervasive
" @entity136 ' testimony about the meeting this week contradicts what he told @entity1 's @entity139 in 2010 , just before the first anniversary of @entity5 's death
he testified monday that it was a " highly charged situation " because of producers ' concerns about @entity5 's readiness for the show just three weeks away , although he downplayed the drama in the @entity1 interview
contrary to the production manager 's e-mail , @entity4 told @entity1 there was no concern about @entity5 's dancing
" you know , there was very little to worry about him performing
" " @entity117 felt that @entity5 was taking this show a little too nonchalantly , " @entity4 told @entity1
@entity4 testified monday that the meeting with dr. @entity38 and @entity5 -- which he called " an intervention " in an e-mail -- was called to find out what was wrong with @entity5
but in the @entity1 interview , @entity4 denied it was @entity4 who wanted @entity38 to be there
" @entity5 brought him , " he said
" that was @entity5 's choice
he brought dr. @entity38 into the meeting
" " i did n't invite dr. @entity38 into the meeting , " @entity4 said in response to a follow up question by @entity139
" @entity5 brought dr. @entity38 into the meeting
" " why would @entity5 feel he needed his doctor to meet with the concert promoters ? " @entity139 asked
" because he was using dr. @entity38 like he would a manager or a representative , " @entity4 said
" he wanted him to speak for him
" " did that seem odd to you ? " @entity139 asked
" no , nothing seems odd in @entity5 world , " he said
@entity1 's @entity180 contributed to this report .
