@entity0 carrying empty jerry cans and water bottles , waiting for the government water tanker truck to arrive
' we only get water once a week and each time we have to fight for it , " one woman yells
there are no laid pipelines in unplanned areas like this , so tanker trucks are their only source of water
with the truck arrives chaos
some climb to the top of the tanker truck , reaching out for the pipes
others jostle and argue below , trying to collect every drop
many have been waiting for hours for their weekly supply and they are visibly angry
every household in this neighborhood is allowed only four jerry cans each
" with so little water , we do n't know if we should drink it , cook with it , or bathe with it , " one woman says
water shortages are a perennial problem in much of @entity42 , but this summer the country 's newly elected government is facing extra heat over water
some 150 million @entity42 have no access to clean water , according to government data
finding a long term solution will take time , but for now the @entity0 government has finalized plans to set up 500 " water atms " across the city
the tall cylindrical concrete structures hold solar powered machines that look and function like an atm
instead of cash , they dispense water
the innovative idea was initiated by an @entity42 social enterprise called @entity65 -- meaning water for all
since the pilot project was launched in late 2013 , @entity65 has installed 15 water atm 's in a @entity0 re-settlement colony called @entity71
for one cent , one can draw up to four liters of water
that 's cheap even by @entity42 standards
though response has been slow , the thousand odd families who use the services say it has made a significant difference to their lives
" there 's no more tension now , " says @entity81 , a @entity82 resident
" now we can get water whenever we feel like it
" before these so - called water @entity59 's , she too had to wake up every morning worrying about where to find water
her whole day revolved around the water tanker truck 's schedule
now with her rechargeable smartcard , @entity81 can access clean drinking water 24/7
ground water is purified at localized plants , and distributed through these solar powered atms
@entity65 's project manager @entity99 says incidents of water - borne diseases have decreased in this neighborhood since the project was launched
but @entity42 's poor have yet to realize that paying for clean water can save much more in health care costs later
the biggest challenge is that everyone expects everything for free , @entity99 said
@entity99 and his team have held countless meetings with the community to make them understand the difference in water quality and why clean water is worth paying for
the change in mindset may take some time , but this simple but high tech idea may be the solution in a country with ever increasing thirst for clean water
