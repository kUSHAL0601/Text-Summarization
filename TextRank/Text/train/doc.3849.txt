after moving to @entity1 , @entity0 could not stop running into his ex-girlfriend
there were four awkward and unplanned encounters in six months , to be exact
so while most social apps are about connecting with friends , family or good - looking strangers , @entity0 began to wonder if a mobile tool could use the same readily available location information to help you avoid certain people
that 's how he and @entity14 were inspired to create cloak , a free @entity17 app that pulls in location check - ins from your contacts ' @entity20 and @entity21 accounts
it maps out the positions of people you know based on their most recent social posts so you can give them the slip
@entity31 's tagline is " incognito mode for real life
" you might say it 's an anti-social network
click on a bubble on the map , and you 'll see a person 's name , his or her location and about how long ago he or she checked in there
if it was a while ago , the image will appear faded , like a ghost
" we feel like we 've reached the point of social fatigue -- too many networks with too much information , all the time , " @entity14 says
" it 's ok to turn off and pick up a copy of ' @entity53 ' and just be alone
" the app lets people set up push alerts for acquaintances they 'd prefer to avoid such as exes , frenemies or annoying co-workers
if someone wants to drop off the grid completely , he can set up these notifications for everyone in his social networks -- presumably while sneaking through dark alleys or hiding behind sunglasses and a hat
the app only works with @entity21 and @entity20 for now , so it has limited usefulness if your friends are n't active on those networks
but the developers hope to add @entity76 soon
they say @entity78 's location information is still weak , but they may add that service as well someday
dodging friends is n't necessarily an anti-social activity
@entity14 says there are plenty of times a person might want to avoid being seen , such as while on a first date or during a quick run to the grocery store in pajamas
anyone playing hooky , recovering from plastic surgery or carrying on a clandestine relationship might also find the app useful
for some digital users , the move away from always - on oversharing is a natural progression
after years of being on our phones 24/7 , getting constant updates from our social networks and broadcasting our every social outing , many of us crave a break
all that contact online can leave us wanting more privacy in real life
" @entity78 and @entity76 ... are like giant auditoriums where we put on ' public performances
' and those have grown exhausting
that 's why @entity112 felt so refreshing , " @entity0 says
the app is still young , but @entity0 says users have already found creative , social ways to use it
some are exploring @entity20 images by using the map , while others have set up alerts for people they do want to see
in theory , someone could use the app purposefully to run into people who 'd rather be ignored
to prevent any unwanted abuse of your location information , lock down your privacy settings and do n't share your whereabouts unless you 're comfortable with people knowing exactly where you are
" @entity131 has had its moment in the sun. now people are beginning to revolt , " @entity14 says .
