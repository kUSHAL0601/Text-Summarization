@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sweet fragrance of a thousand sticks of burning incense curls into reverent smoke clouds on this lucky night of the new moon
we are inside @entity0 's oldest temple , @entity10 , deeply immersed in the history and traditions of this chaotic , modern city in @entity1
on the first and 15th night of each lunar month , @entity14 , @entity15 and worshipers of the ancient goddess of the sea , @entity19 , gather here to pray , bring food and flowers and share the wonders of their faiths
it has been the same here twice a month , almost every month , for 274 years
immigrants from @entity32 's @entity31 province built this ornate temple in 1738 during the @entity34
it has been damaged by earthquakes , storms and war but restored numerous times
as with many @entity42 temples , it has three decorated gates , one inside the next
in the first courtyard is a waterfall , a point of ablution that recalls the water wells outside mosques , the baptismal waters of @entity51 and even more ancient , the washing spring at the base of @entity55 's great @entity54 at @entity56
carved , richly painted dragons guard the entrances
inside the main chamber is an explosion of brilliant color
tonight , there are the people -- hundreds of them , from every section and class of this society
they hold incense between their clasped hands or with their hands open flat and pressed against one another in front of their chest or against their forehead , facing toward an altar or a richly decorated table , bowing and praying
when they are finished , they place the incense into huge gold pots , many decorated with religious figurines
some set bright candles alight on massive candelabra
the ceilings are rich with gold
on the walls hang signs with ancient poetry
long tables are filled with food , which those who have brought it later eat to imbibe the blessings the food has absorbed
everywhere there are flowers , thousands of flowers
just outside are the teeming streets of @entity0 -- the bustle of the @entity10 metro station , the chaotic tastes of the @entity100 night market , the strange sights of @entity102 , and the overwhelming crowds and commercialism of the @entity106 shopping district
beyond the horizon , the mainland 's missiles -- said to number in the hundreds -- poised to arrive in just seven minutes
but inside @entity10 , all that curls away
for the hundreds of believers who gather here , for these few minutes , on this night of luck and wonder , there is just the path , reverent peace and a connection with history that stays with the visitor long after the next morning dawns
location : no. 211 guangzhou street , @entity127 , @entity0 hours : 6:00 a.m. -10:20 p.m. admission : free getting there : driving the circuitous streets of inner - city @entity0 is not for the faint - hearted , and parking can be challenge
