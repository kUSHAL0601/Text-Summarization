-- @entity3 president @entity2 , who is being treated in @entity4 after an attack on his compound , will return to @entity3 on friday , senior adviser @entity1 told @entity0
the ruling @entity8 party said the president will be received by celebrations , but anti-government demonstrators throughout the country likely would not welcome his return
@entity3 security forces and pro-revolution armed tribesmen have been clashing intermittently in @entity16 starting late tuesday night , according to eyewitnesses
the clashes have been in the @entity20 and @entity21 areas of the city , approximately 1 kilometer ( half - mile ) west of @entity23 , according to eyewitnesses
residents also report hearing gunfire in the city
@entity16 is one of the epicenters for the anti-government movement in @entity3 the protesters are demanding that @entity2 leave office , and there were celebrations in the streets when he left for treatment
" @entity2 's arrival back to @entity3 is not a surprise ; we said all along that he is traveling for medical treatment and , like any other president in the world , is expected to be back to his country and continue with the role of leadership , " said @entity36 , a senior @entity2 aide
@entity1 said @entity4 doctors have given @entity2 the green light to return home
" when he is back , he will rule as normal and the country will continue to be under his control
@entity2 will return strong and the will of the people will stand against any other will , " he said
@entity2 will rule until the end of his term in 2013 , @entity1 added
opposition leaders called news of @entity2 's return false rumors
" the ruling party are experts in lying and that is why we are not taking their comments seriously , " said @entity61 of the opposition @entity62
@entity68 , prominent @entity3 rights activist and a leading figure in the youth revolutionary movement , said the " youth are now coordinating with the political powers here in @entity3 in preparation for the @entity77 era " and noted that it is " impossible for @entity2 to come back
" " the youth have the backing of the international community and the @entity2 era is over , " he said
" @entity3 will not allow @entity2 back in @entity3 and he is smart enough to know that he is not wanted anymore and that @entity3 have decided to live without him
" @entity82 -- representative of the revolution youth organizing committee , the largest of the groups that comprise the youth revolutionary movement -- said " the youth want to coordinate and create a transition council but we are trying to involve all political factions in the process except the ruling party
" in @entity94 , @entity93 spokeswoman @entity92 said at the briefing tuesday that she was not aware of reports that @entity2 planned to return to @entity3 friday
but she added , " whether he stays in @entity4 , whether he goes back , our request is the same : he needs to sign the @entity99 agreement and we need to move on with the transfer to a more democratic , progressive @entity3
" @entity2 had voiced agreement with the plan by the @entity99 , a group of six @entity103 , for his gradual departure , but he refused to sign it
government forces have been locked in conflict with @entity109 's @entity3 wing , and authorities fear the group , called @entity112 , is exploiting the political instability
it has a strong presence in southern @entity3
many people have fled their homes because of violence
close to 45,000 people in southern @entity3 have been displaced , particularly in @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity125 provinces , the @entity120 @entity119 estimated this week
