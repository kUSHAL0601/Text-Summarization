-- when @entity3 star @entity2 selected the decor for the @entity5 -- the boutique hotel he co-owns with his wife and fellow actor @entity7 -- there was one thing above all else that he wanted to embody in the design
" sex -- every choice in here was about sex , " joked @entity2 , as he took @entity0 's @entity12 on a tour of the eight - bedroom luxury inn
this amorous sentiment was echoed in a slightly less forward fashion by @entity21 , who said " romance " and " intimacy " were key inspirations behind the hotel 's design
she said they had tried to create an open atmosphere where guests feel at home and comfortable to be themselves
" it 's just a relaxed place , " she said , adding that each room had been designed to exude a " serene " aura -- reflected in the muted palette and earthy tones used throughout the inn
