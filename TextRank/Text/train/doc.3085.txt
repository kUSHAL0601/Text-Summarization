@entity165 has sold 1.2 million @entity148 portable gaming devices since launch last year , but those numbers could have been much higher without increased competition from smartphones and tablets
" i think that the smartphone and tablet market is cannibalizing the dedicated handheld market , especially for non-core gamers , " said @entity172 , videogame analyst for @entity174
" the casual games offered on smartphones and tablets are good enough for a large minority of people who play games , and the large number of free - to - play casual games on smartphones and tablets will keep most casual gamers occupied

" the number of viable platforms for consuming media such as games has exploded , and the tech infrastructure companies now need to be more agile , more responsive , and more diversified than any other point in their histories , " @entity13 said
" it 's a fun time to be a tech company , albeit a bit frenzied and insane by all the new product cycles
" it 's also a fun time to be a gamer , as there are more games available for more devices than ever before
and the quality of these experiences , especially in the portable space , appears to be getting better all the time .
