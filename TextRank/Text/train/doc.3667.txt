-- leave it to @entity2 to give one of the strangest -- or most creative -- interviews of all time
for a recent sitdown with @entity9 magazine , the actor / performance artist decided that he did n't want to use words to communicate and instead let his eyes do all the talking
the result is an hour - long video in which @entity2 and his interviewer , @entity15 , sit and stare at each other in near silence
( no words are exchanged , but there is some awkward laughter
) according to @entity22 , this was all @entity2 's idea
he reached out to the @entity9 writer in september , and the two soon struck up an email correspondence
in a series of exchanges , they cover topics including metamodernism , faith , cynicism and even a claim by @entity2 that he was sexually assaulted during a performance art exhibit this year
after a bit of back - and - forth , @entity2 agreed to do what he calls " the # interview
" " i like the idea that we meet in person with a go pro photographic record but no interview , " the actor wrote in one of his emails to @entity22
" we just look into each others eyes for an hour , connect on a soul level and film that as the interview and keep the words online so we will will both have go pro cameras strapped to our heads for the full hour and the footage will be presented raw as a split screen and you can use it on the @entity58 video site
" indeed , the full video is now up and ready for viewing
interview from @entity63 / @entity62 on @entity64
by doing it this way , " i 'm present in the magazine only in words obtained digitally and online i 'm present only through a mute physical presence , " @entity2 concluded
" ( a ) nd the reality of my self lies somewhere between and beyond the two it 's thoroughly metamodern i think
" while the video shows @entity2 and @entity22 in their staring competition , their emails are overflowing with language
at one point , @entity2 opens up about his # @entity80 performance art exhibit from this year , when he encouraged visitors to come and view him one - on - one in a small room
before seeing him , visitors were encouraged to pick up an item from a table of " implements , " which included things like a " @entity102 " toy , a whip ( he starred in 2008 's " @entity92 " ) , @entity94 's kisses , a bottle of @entity97 whiskey , a bottle of cologne , pliers and a ukelele
once they stepped into the room with @entity2 , they would sit across a table from the actor , who was wearing a paper bag over his head that read , " i am not famous anymore
" @entity2 has said that the art exhibit did n't go the way he anticipated ; he thought people were going to be rude or mean , but once they were face - to - face with him , there were more often displays of humanity
" i went from being a celebrity or object to a fellow human , " @entity2 said in his email exchange with @entity9
" ( @entity124 ) t happened in less than a second for some for others they needed to take the bag off but it usually happened and by ' it ' i mean connection it was a very human encounter once it was 2 people in a room
" the title of the project was a genuine reflection of how he felt at the time , @entity2 continued
" i was broken - it was n't manipulation - i was heartbroken and people i 've never met before came in and loved on me and with me some for multiple days some would come in hold my hand and cry with me some would come in and tell me to ' figure it out ' to ' be a man ' in the end i felt cared for however it came - it was beautiful it blew me away i 've never experienced love like that , empathy humanity , understanding " not every encounter was as exemplary in its kindness , though
there was one visitor whom @entity2 alleges sexually assaulted him
" one woman who came with her boyfriend who was out side the door when this happened whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then striped my clothing and proceeded to rape me then walked out with her lipstick smudged to her awaiting boyfriend who i image was quite hurt by it " not to mention @entity2 's girlfriend , who he said was in line to view his exhibition the same day this event happened
" it really hurt her as well as i guess the news of it traveled through the line she was only about 25 people back when she came in she asked for an ( explanation ) and i could n't speak so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently it was painful the hardest part of the show " @entity2 's had a hard year overall , including legal trouble
in june , he was charged with disorderly conduct , harassment and criminal trespass after being accused of drunken and disruptive behavior in a @entity184 venue
he spent a little time in jail , but the charges were settled on the grounds that @entity2 would continue seeking treatment for alcohol addiction
but with projects like # @entity191 , @entity2 said he 's seeking a sense of purpose
" im finding my self through these projects , " he explained to @entity9
