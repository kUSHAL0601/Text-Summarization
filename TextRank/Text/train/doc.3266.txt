-- @entity1 won a bruising three - hour contest against @entity3 at the @entity4 on tuesday
he had plenty left in the tank when he faced a surging @entity6
he did n't have to save any match points against the @entity9 great -- the @entity11 no. 1 fended off four of them to oust @entity3 , last year 's finalist in @entity4 -- but @entity1 rallied to beat @entity6 36 75 64 under the lights on stadium court wednesday
the 21st - ranked @entity1 has now eliminated @entity6 twice in a row after upsetting the 32 - year - old at the @entity17 in three sets last year
" feeling good , of course , to beat @entity6 , " @entity1 told the @entity20 's website
" i thought i really played well , especially in the third
i was hitting both deep and striking well
" everything was going well
there ( were a ) couple of tough moments , but i was fighting through
" @entity6 entered the match as the substantial favorite despite the defeat in the @entity30 capital , having returned to full fitness and finding his old form after a back injury hindered him for much of 2013
he reached the final at the @entity35 earlier this month and there was a real possibility of the 17 - time grand slam champion making the @entity35 and @entity4 finals in the same year for the first time since claiming both titles in 2006
" i could never really get my service games going , " @entity6 told the @entity20 's website
" on the return , as the match went on , i think it was that @entity1 started to serve a bit better , which made it more difficult
" @entity1 became the first man to break @entity6 in this year 's tournament , perhaps not a surprise since he is second only to @entity3 in percentage of return games won in 2014
still , @entity6 led by a break twice in the second set , only to see @entity1 -- whose career has been interrupted by arm and abdominal injuries -- break immediately back
the lone break of the third set came in the final game
" i think @entity1 does really well controlling the ball , " said @entity6
" he has great technique , especially on the backhand , very simple , very short back swings , so he does a really nice job of having good timing
" i predict he 's going to be in the top 10 in a short while
" @entity1 next faces @entity68 , who defeated @entity69 in straight sets
world no. 1 @entity72 , bidding for a maiden triumph in @entity4 , plays big - serving @entity74 and the in - form @entity75 encounters @entity77 in the remaining two men 's quarterfinals .
