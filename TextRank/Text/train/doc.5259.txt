@entity0 -- a nonprofit consumer group said thursday that it will sue @entity3 , alleging " deceptive and irresponsible " advertising that contends selenium in two of its multivitamins may reduce men 's risk of prostate cancer
one @entity14 ads say selenium may cut men 's risk of prostate cancer , a consumer group says
the @entity17 said it informed the multinational company of its intent thursday
@entity20 , the center 's senior nutritionist , told reporters during a teleconference that the center already has filed a complaint with the @entity26
" we are standing behind all the claims we make in support of the products , " @entity27 , @entity3 's global spokeswoman , told @entity1
" the selenium claims are made by a [ @entity32 ] - approved qualified health claim
we regularly review the evidence , and we change our claims if necessitated
the emerging science has n't compelled us to change our claims , and the @entity32 claim is intact
" @entity3 's @entity38 , based in @entity39 , @entity40 , researches , manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products
@entity3 promotes one a day men 's 50 + advantage and one a day @entity46 @entity45 multivitamins on package labels , tv and radio ads and on its web site
in its promotions , the company says " emerging research " suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer , the center said
" did you know that there are more new cases of prostate cancer each year than any other cancer ? " according to one radio ad
" now there is something you can do
" both dietary supplements contain 105 micrograms of the trace mineral selenium per daily dose , or about twice the @entity69 , which is 55 micrograms a day for adults , according to the center
@entity72 , your connection for better living " it 's astounding that a company such as @entity3 ... would make such deceptive claims , " the center 's litigation director , @entity75 , told reporters during the same teleconference
supporting the center in its letter of complaint to the @entity26 are nine researchers , who wrote a separate letter to @entity87 , associate director of advertising practices
among the signees are medical professionals from the @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity94 @entity93
all agree there is scant evidence to support @entity3 's claim
a seven - year , $ 118 million study funded by the @entity101 found last year that selenium does not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men , the center said
the @entity105 and @entity106 involving 35,000 @entity107 and @entity109 men was halted in october when researchers determined that selenium was not protecting the men from prostate cancer and may have been causing diabetes in some of them
according to the researchers in their letter supporting the @entity26 's complaint , " the federally financed study was the largest individually , randomized cancer prevention trial ever conducted , and , given its high rates of adherence and its statistical power , it is unlikely to have missed detecting a benefit of even a very modest size
" " @entity3 is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer , " they added
@entity1 's @entity132 contributed to this report .
