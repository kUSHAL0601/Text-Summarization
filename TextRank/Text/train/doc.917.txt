-- a report detailing the @entity5 's controversial interrogation and detention program after the 9/11 terror attacks will be delayed over the issue of redactions , @entity2 chairman @entity1 said tuesday
congressional sources in each party had previously said the report could have been released as early as this week
" after further review of the redacted version of the executive summary , i have concluded the redactions eliminate or obscure key facts that support the report 's findings and conclusions
until these redactions are addressed to the committee 's satisfaction , the report will not be made public , " @entity1 said in a written statement
" i am sending a letter today to the president laying out a series of changes to the redactions that we believe are necessary prior to public release
the @entity34 and the intelligence community have committed to working through these changes in good faith
this process will take some time , and the report will not be released until i am satisfied that all redactions are appropriate , " she wrote
the document that will be released is a nearly 700 - page summary of the full 6,800 - page report that was approved a year and a half ago by a committee sharply divided along party lines
senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the @entity5 's treatment of terrorism suspects , saying it amounted to torture , something @entity5 officials have denied
it also finds that those harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future terrorist attacks as many in the intelligence community have said
after the committee voted this spring to release a declassified version to the public , the report was sent to the intelligence community and the @entity34 so classified and other sensitive information could be redacted
the report 's creation has been highly controversial , with the @entity5 director apologizing and admitting the agency spied on computers used by @entity2 staffers who prepared the extensive report
according to an administration official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , a " constructive dialogue " with the @entity2 about the report is already underway
" the bottom line is that the @entity76 must never again make the mistakes documented in this report
i believe the best way to accomplish that is to make public our thorough documentary history of the @entity5 's program
that is why i believe taking our time and getting it right is so important , and i will not rush this process , " @entity1 said
' shocking ' report on @entity5 interrogation closer to public release @entity0 's @entity92 and @entity93 contributed to this report .
