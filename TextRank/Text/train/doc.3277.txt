-- @entity1 has been forced to withdraw from the @entity2 for the second successive year after suffering an injured heel
@entity1 , who surrendered the @entity5 spot monday to @entity6 , was hoping to build on her title win at the @entity8 where she defeated the @entity10 star
the @entity11 would have regained the @entity5 ranking had she won the tournament , but @entity6 is set to remain at the summit until the @entity17 @entity16 tournament next month
" i 'm very disappointed , but i have to listen to my body , " @entity1 told reporters
" the injury happened last week when i played a lot of tennis , so going on to a new tournament is just too much
the heel kept getting worse , and i needed to re-evaluate
" sometimes the schedule is just too difficult
unfortunately you ca n't know when you plan it in november what will happen in february
" i did n't want to continue taking painkillers because sometimes it 's better to feel the pain
so that you can control the injury
otherwise it can cause something which is much worse
" this is just a warning that i have to take care of myself
" @entity1 , who has a 14 - 0 record this year , revealed that the physical demands of the schedule has become a growing concern since she won the @entity41 last month
" i never realised before just how much it takes out of you , " she said
" physically and mentally it just drains you out - and then you realise
" meanwhile , @entity6 , who is the oldest woman to ever hold top spot in the rankings , is the big favorite for the $ 2 million tournament
and the 31 - year - old says she 's feeling in rude health going into the competition
she told reporters : " i was really , really , really , really sick last week and physically i just was n't at my best , considering i could n't train , and i did n't practice
" i practised only one or two days before playing because i had the ankle problems
" but i did n't want to not show up and not play
so at least if i could show up and play my way into shape i would be able to compete and that 's what i did
" i feel so much better this week already
i feel like a completely different athlete , and a completely different person , compared with last week
