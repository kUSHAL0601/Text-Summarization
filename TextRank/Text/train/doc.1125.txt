@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 leader @entity3 said it was " clear that the @entity7 government has lost its mandate to govern this country , " as exit - poll predictions put his party on course to win more seats than it had for 80 years
he said the @entity4 had fought a " positive and energetic " campaign
it was clear from the results that " the country wants change " and " that change is going to require new leadership
" exit polls suggest the @entity4 are on pace to win 305 seats -- though this would be 21 short of a majority in the 650 - seat @entity27
prime minister @entity28 gave no indication early friday that he would step down after being returned to parliament by his constituents in @entity32 , @entity33
full election coverage the " outcome is not yet known but my duty
. is to play my part in @entity39 having a strong , stable and principled government , " he said
" i will not let you down
" i am very determined and have been through quite a lot in my political career and in my personal life , and i am used to difficulties
" if the predictions are borne out by results , the @entity39 is heading for a " hung parliament " in which no single party controls an overall majority
the leader of the largest party traditionally gets the first chance to form the government and become prime minister
but if no party has a majority , the sitting prime minister has the right to stay in office and try to win a confidence motion in parliament
" the sitting prime minister and the incumbent government are given the first chance to create a majority that commands the confidence of the @entity27 , and if they fail to do that it passes to the leader of the opposition , " top @entity7 politician @entity67 told @entity2
@entity28 arrived at @entity7 headquarters in @entity0 early friday after flying in from @entity33
he smiled and shook hands as he entered the building with his wife , @entity74 , but said nothing to waiting cameras and reporters
several high - profile incumbents lost their seats overnight , including former home secretary @entity80 , of @entity7 ; @entity82 first minister @entity81 , leader of the @entity84 ; and liberal democrat @entity85 , who had been in parliament for 13 years
all had been implicated in last year 's parliamentary expenses scandal
@entity81 's loss could hurt the @entity4 , robbing them of a potential supporter in the @entity90 should the party need to form a coalition
the @entity93 , which favors environmental and social justice policies , gained its first - ever member of parliament when @entity96 was elected in @entity97 , in southern @entity1
there were some scenes of voter anger across the country over long lines to cast ballots or polling stations running out of ballot papers , but it was not immediately clear how widespread problems were
anger at polling stations " we will be doing a serious and thorough review of this and making recommendations to parliament and the government , " @entity109 chairwoman @entity108 said
the @entity39 's system of voting is " @entity118 , antiquated , left over from an era when less people had to vote " and not designed to cope with mass participation , she said , adding that the system is now " at breaking point
" it 's very unusual for no party to get an absolute majority of seats in the @entity90
the last time it happened , in 1974 , voters were back at the polls within months
after the election there will be 650 seats in the @entity90 , four more than in the previous parliament
voters chose representatives for only 649 seats , however , because the death of a candidate in northern @entity1 postponed that election to may 27 , local officials said
under the @entity39 electoral system , the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins
the system , known as " first past the post , " is praised for its simplicity and the strong ties it forms between voters and representatives , but critics dislike its failure to provide proportional representation
@entity2 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 in @entity0 contributed to this report .
