after days of caving , counter-caving , threats , u-turns , investigations and pontifications , it 's hard to know which way 's up anymore with @entity9 , " @entity10 " and @entity11
so , now people will go to the movie when it opens @entity15 in the @entity16 and then perhaps everyone can judge the merits of this massive incident , but let 's take a moment to speak for the only subgroup not represented in the viral debate
the film is about journalists , yes ? ok , let 's see what this might do for / to journalists , then
@entity9 chairman @entity30 ( a friend ) said this about the film to @entity7 : " first of all , we made the movie because it was -- because we thought it was a funny comedy
secondly , there is a long history of political satire in film
and this clearly falls into that realm
and @entity30 -- who had run @entity41 after the 1980 's @entity43 affair , when @entity44 condemned @entity43 to death for writing " @entity46 " -- admitted that @entity9 's originally pulling " @entity10 " from theaters was a blow to freedom of expression , which is uniquely dear and protected under the @entity16 @entity51
and after declaring @entity53 was in fact behind the massive attack , president @entity52 weighed in about setting a dangerous precedent : " we can not have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the @entity16 , " @entity52 said
" imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they do n't like or news reports that they do n't like
and that 's where we journalists come in
because after all the @entity73 about process , corporate profits , legal liabilities , constitutional rights , letting terrorists set the agenda -- let 's talk a little about content
let 's in fact spare a thought for our subset diligently working away out there in the @entity16 and around the world
what 's the message ? @entity90 , media writer for the @entity91 , said this about the film 's content : " ... while i am all for bold creative choices , was it really important that the head being blown up in a comedy about bungling assassins be that of an actual sitting ruler of a sovereign state ? if you want to satirize a lawless leader , there are plenty of ways to skin that cat , as @entity109 demonstrated with " @entity110 , " which skewered @entity111 in everything but name
" yes , and ... ? what about those bungling assassins
they 're journalists , right ? @entity118 meant to be ? and what message will that send to every whacked - out dictator from another planet , paranoid , control freak thug posing as president ? not to mention crazy extremist throat - slitting militant terrorists ? i do n't want to spoil the discussion - party about satire , comedy , freedom of expression , etc. , but i can tell you from personal experience the above - mentioned already think we are velvet revolutionaries at best , or @entity135 agents , military spies ... and yes , would - be assassins ! one of the most appalling acts of " journo murder " was the killing of legendary @entity142 freedom fighter @entity141 , just days before 9/11
imagine , two terrorists posing as journalist and cameraman get @entity10
they are in fact wired - up suicide bombers
no one thought to check them and the rest is history
in @entity153 , 35 journalists are in jail on specious charges , including @entity157 @entity156 of the @entity158
his mother told me the family has heard that a closed " trial " condemned him on " espionage - related " charges
it 's nonsense , of course , but this is what journalists have to endure
the @entity153 government seems to believe all these people are regime - change agents , through cultural subversion
they are terrified of a so - called @entity174 and color revolutions ever since they put down the @entity176 after the disputed 2009 elections
journalists were swept up in a dragnet , forced to " confess " on @entity153 state tv before being " tried " and sentenced to the infamous @entity181
check out @entity183 's excellent debut movie , " @entity184 , " on the case of @entity187 - @entity153 journalist @entity186
it 's a sobering saga of the ridiculous , kafkaesque dark reality of what it takes to be a journalist in @entity153 and other countries
in @entity195 , offending journalists -- not to mention anyone who vaguely looks sideways at @entity197 -- can feel the wrath of the system
some are arrested , some worse
anyone remember reporter @entity202 , shot point blank in her @entity205 apartment building in 2006 ? a staunch critic of the @entity207 and author of " @entity209 , " she was working on a series of reports about human rights abuses in @entity213 at the time of her death
and by the way , @entity217 this week caved in to the @entity195 government 's demand that a site for opposition politician @entity222 be taken down
he 's under house arrest
huh ? i did n't hear a peep of " @entity227 " about this serious damage to freedom of expression
terrible year for journalists in the @entity232 over the years , in these and many other countries , the number of journalists killed , injured , arrested and just plain shut up , has soared and continues its horrible upward trajectory
finally , this year , spare a thought for the victims of the madmen of today 's @entity232 : journalists @entity240 and @entity242 , aid workers @entity243 and @entity245 , were trussed up in @entity247 colors , and forced to kneel before their throats were slit so wide their heads came off
before their execution , they were forced to denigrate their families and their flags
they were forced to admit to false charges of spying and plotting
they were forced to give up their very dignity before they were forced to give up their lives
as i say , " @entity266 " might be very funny
i just wish it were n't yet more fodder for the deluded who see all journalists as their mortal enemy
we have n't mentioned what @entity11 does to offending journalists
their own prisoners get labor camps , torture and starvation rations , if they 're not executed
foreigners get traded for a whole load of publicity and who knows what else
but i bet journalist @entity285 is probably pleased her sister 's prison ordeal there began and ended ( in 2009 ) before this film was released
and furthermore i can assure you , our colleagues who have been so brutally killed and imprisoned , this year and every year , were certainly not the " easily distracted members of the @entity16 press who choose gossip " type that " @entity298 " and " newsroom " creator @entity297 railed against in his @entity9 - rage last week
" the wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the @entity16 press who chose gossip and schadenfreude - fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public -- a story that was developing right in front of their eyes , " @entity297 said in a statement
no , the ones we lost this year were brilliant , brave and full of heart , daring to keep doing the dangerous job of bringing you the truth
may they rest in peace
--- - ( @entity323 -- rip also @entity324 , after 100 years of important game - changing journalism
my favorite observation is by now - resigned literary editor @entity325 : " we need not be a nation of intellectuals but we must not be a nation of idiots
