@entity0 , @entity1 -- the plea of a pregnant woman to be granted an abortion has gripped @entity1 for months : she wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby would not survive outside the womb and that her life was at risk
but abortion is illegal without exceptions in @entity1 , and on wednesday , the country 's @entity15 denied her petition
@entity18 for the 22 - year - old woman , known only as " @entity20 , " argued that the mother 's life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated
ill woman at center of abortion debate in @entity1 in a 3 - 1 vote , the justices ruled the risk to @entity20 's life was not imminent but a possibility in the future
" this court finds that the rights of the mother can not be prioritized over those of the ( fetus ) nor vice versa , " the ruling said
the ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life , and to the unborn baby , too
@entity20 is suffering from lupus and kidney problems , and her unborn child developed without parts of the brain or skull
she asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life , but doctors were hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they would n't be prosecuted , her attorneys said
doctors said they expect the baby to survive only for hours after birth
she argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child , who is a year old
anti-abortion groups countered that abortion - rights advocates were using @entity20 as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws
" the constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception , and anything that tries to end a life is murder , " lawmaker @entity71 said after the ruling
women 's rights groups who have held rallies in support of @entity20 said they were disappointed by the ruling and criticized the high court for taking weeks to reach a decision
" there has to be a prudent period ( to make a decision ) that does n't take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis , " said @entity88 of the rights group @entity89
the court 's decision is not the end of the @entity20 's options
her family has said she is considering traveling outside the country to a place where an abortion can be carried out legally
