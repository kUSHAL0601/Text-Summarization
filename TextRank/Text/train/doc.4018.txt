-- legendary @entity2 footballer @entity1 believes @entity4 's return to @entity5 will benefit the @entity7 club but he has warned there is no guarantee the @entity10 can deliver success
@entity4 made his long - awaited return to @entity13 on monday , after cutting short a three - year tenure at @entity15 despite having another three years left on his contract
the 50 - year - old won the 2012 league title with the @entity21 giants , and the @entity22 the year before , but failed in the club 's primary objective -- to win a 10th @entity26 crown
the relative lack of success in the @entity29 , where @entity4 guided @entity15 to the semifinals in each of his three seasons , may underpin @entity1 's comments about his reappointment at the home of the 2012 @entity26 titleholders
" @entity4 's return is good for @entity5 because he 's a good coach , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity36
" he is talented and very honest
but football is a box of surprises
" he has to have a bit of luck because in football , sometimes the best does n't work
i wish him good luck
" during his first stint in charge of @entity5 from 2004 - 2007 , @entity4 delivered the club 's first @entity49 title in half a century before adding another @entity52 crown , an @entity53 and two @entity54 as well
while he was away , the former @entity56 manager won his second @entity29 with @entity57 in 2010 , a year when he won the league title for the second time with the @entity61 club
desperate to win the @entity29 for the first time since 2002 , @entity15 turned to @entity4 just days after he ended @entity57 's barren 35 - year run in the competition
but even with the goalscoring ability of star player @entity67 , the semis proved an insurmountable barrier as successive exits at the hands of @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 followed
@entity4 's relationship with his compatriot @entity67 broke down towards the end of his @entity15 reign and the coach explained why in typically outspoken fashion during an interview broadcast by popular @entity21 football show " @entity82 " on tuesday
" i had only one problem with him -- very simple , very basic -- which was when a coach criticizes a player from a tactical viewpoint , trying to improve what in my view could have been improved , " he said
" and at that moment he did n't take it very well because maybe he thinks he knows everything and the coach can not help him to develop more
" while @entity67 's future at @entity15 has been the subject of recent debate , the endless speculation is finally over about where a @entity2 youngster who is often compared to @entity1 will end up
@entity98 , 21 , signed a five - year deal with @entity15 's great rivals @entity71 this week , leaving behind the very club where @entity1 made his name from 1956 - 1974 : @entity103
after winning numerous titles with the club , including the @entity106 , @entity98 has often been labeled " the next @entity1 " but the man himself -- still the only player to have won the @entity108 on three separate occasions -- refuses to make such a comparison
" to be the new @entity1 would be very difficult , because my mother and my father closed the machine , " joked the 72 - year - old , who lifted the @entity114 trophy in 1958 , 1962 and 1970
" but no doubt he is one of the best players we have in @entity2
" " of course in @entity2 we have a lot of excellent players like @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity1 , @entity127 , but the last two years we have @entity98 , who is very talented
" i hope he has luck in @entity71
i did n't like it so much because he used to play in my team , @entity103
i lost a good player
but it 's important to understand that he deserves to go to the best team
