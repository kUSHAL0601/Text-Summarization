dramatic video of a stunt pilot buzzing a @entity4 runway -- narrowly missing two people -- has prompted the @entity6 to investigate the incident , authorities confirmed thursday
the video , shot january 16 at @entity9 south of @entity10 , depicts a plane coming in close proximity to two people in an apparently staged stunt
the pilot , identified as @entity16 , previously had an @entity6 waiver to do aerobatics at the airport , but the waiver expired in november , an @entity6 source -- who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation -- told @entity24
@entity6 spokesman @entity25 said thursday the agency is investigating the incident
" even with a valid waiver , there is a requirement that people on the ground not be endangered , " he said
the 19 - second clip , titled " 200mph plane fly - by within 2 feet of person , " was uploaded to @entity34 , according to @entity35 , which also posted the video
in a @entity44 post , a member of @entity41 -- a motorcycle stunt team -- reported the footage was shot during a " practice session for upcoming shows , " the @entity39 reported
the @entity39 is owned by @entity48 , which also owns @entity24
a @entity24 phone call to @entity50 was not immediately returned , nor were e-mails to the motorcycle stunt team .
