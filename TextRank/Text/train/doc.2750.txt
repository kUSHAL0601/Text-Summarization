-- for the past week , the political fireworks surrounding the landmark decision by the @entity3 to uphold the @entity4 rivaled the excitement of @entity7 pyrotechnics
president @entity8 is facing heavy criticism from @entity10 that he has raised taxes on working - and middle - class @entity12 because the court upheld the individual mandate based on @entity17 ' power to tax
the president and the @entity20 are arguing that the mandate is not a tax but rather a penalty , since those who do not buy health insurance are paying a penalty in the form of a tax
meanwhile , on monday a top adviser to @entity30 raised consternation among @entity10 by saying that the individual mandate is not a tax , countering the prevailing conservative view
soon after , @entity30 himself made his much anticipated statement on the issue on tv , saying that since the @entity3 has declared that the individual mandate is a tax , then it must be a tax
tax ? not a tax ? what 's going on ? the fact of the matter is this : as for who wins the @entity50 , there is probably very little at stake for either @entity30 or president @entity8 in the debate over the tax status of the individual mandate
however the mandate is enforced -- as a tax or as a penalty -- it is a rounding error in the total tax increases in the @entity4
the @entity59 estimates the individual mandate will raise $ 17 billion in revenue for the @entity62 between 2015 , when the first taxes or penalties would be collected under the provision , and 2019
aside from the individual mandate , the health care law includes numerous tax increases , for a total of more than $ 400 billion between 2010 and 2019 , according to estimates by the @entity71
about half that amount , $ 210 billion over 10 years , comes from the increase in the @entity75 payroll tax and a new @entity75 tax on interest , rent and other investment income for individuals who earn more than $ 200,000 or families that earn $ 250,000 annually
but other changes that raise @entity12 ' tax bills include the reduction in the maximum annual contribution -- now capped at $ 2,500 -- to @entity87 ( your employer might call it your " cafeteria plan " to help pay for medical expenses )
there is also an increase in the percent of your income that you must spend on medical expenses before those expenses are tax deductible , up to 10 % from 7.5 %
these two provisions taken together will raise taxes by about $ 28 billion over the law 's first decade
by 2019 , the year when all the health care law 's tax increases will be in effect , the taxes raised by the @entity4 are estimated to be 0.49 % of gdp
that is the 10th largest tax increase since 1950
in 2019 , it will be the largest tax increase in the 26 years since @entity111 's 1993 tax increases
whether the $ 17 billion from the individual mandate is a tax is hardly necessary for the @entity10 to argue that president @entity8 raised taxes
nor does the mandate being a penalty clear the president 's record on taxes
the @entity8 administration and democrats point out that the @entity59 has estimated the health care law will reduce total annual budget deficits between now and 2021
there is considerable controversy over the estimate of the effect of the health care law on deficits , but that aside , it will raise taxes -- and a lot of them
some republicans insist that campaigning against the president on the individual mandate as a tax is still important
because while most of the taxes are levied on employers , corporations and high - earners ( including small businesses ) , the individual mandate is a direct tax on low - and middle - income @entity12
if the mandate is a tax , they argue , the president has broken his pledge not to raise taxes on working - and middle - class @entity12
but , in the court of public opinion , conservatives have already won on the issue of the individual mandate
time and time again , when polled over the last two years , a majority of @entity12 have opposed the national requirement to buy health insurance
looking at self - identified independent voters , those swing voters who decide elections , a march 2012 @entity160 survey found that only 32 % supported a mandate with a " penalty " for noncompliance
while the charge that " you raised taxes on hard - working @entity12 " is a good go - to move in @entity12 politics , it might not be possible for @entity10 to gain more political advantage off the individual mandate than they already have
so what will matter to voters on @entity176 ? how about principled arguments about what " good government " looks like and the proper balance between personal economic security and individual liberty ? and what about a clear , concrete vision for returning prosperity to working - and middle - class @entity12 ? those can be winning issues
for one of the candidates and for all @entity12
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .
