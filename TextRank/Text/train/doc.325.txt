-- this time of year , i am disturbed at the number of curveballs we see being thrown during the @entity5
i coached youth baseball for eight years , each spring and fall
three years ago , i wrote that @entity7 should ban the use of the curveball by its young pitchers
the evidence seemed clear -- and sports injury doctors seemed to all agree -- that pitchers who were 13 and younger were not physically capable of handling the torque and strain on the elbow when throwing a curveball
the ulnar collateral ligaments connecting the lower and upper part of an arm simply could n't survive the strain , they said
now , there is evidence the curveball may not be entirely to blame
but there is still debate over whether it should be allowed at such a young age
@entity5 and others did separate studies -- and got somewhat similar results showing that injuries can result not just from throwing curveballs , but from kids throwing too much , with too little rest between pitching appearances
@entity5 instituted strict pitch - count and innings - pitched rules five years ago
but those rules do n't apply to @entity41 - sanctioned games
" the difference now is , kids are playing on a number of travel and showcase teams outside @entity5 , and they have no such rules , " says @entity42 , vice president of communications for @entity7
" travel ball has no rules on pitch count or number of innings pitched
so you now have kids throwing 300 to 400 pitches over a four - day period , " he says
doctor : ' do n't throw curveballs until you can shave ' @entity7 commissioned its study with @entity62 and the @entity63
more than 1,300 pitchers of all ages were examined
for the @entity5 age group , 409 pitchers were analyzed , looking for which factors influenced injury risk
" what was causing arm problems was not the curve ball , but the overuse of the arm
it found no evidence to say breaking pitches caused no more injuries than any others , " says @entity42
meanwhile , a group of doctors including dr. @entity83 , the country 's leading doctor in sports arm surgeries , conducted their own study
@entity83 specializes in " @entity88 " surgery , which reconstructs the ulnar collateral ligament and is named after a former @entity92 pitcher
@entity83 and his team at the @entity94 did their study in a laboratory , not on a field
and they found throwing a curveball enacts no more force on the arm than a fastball
but , they say , throwing curveballs early can lead you down a dangerous path later in a baseball career
" dr. @entity83 still insists , ' do n't throw curveballs until you can shave , " @entity108 , executive director of @entity94 told @entity0
and , he acknowledges , " that was a controlled lab setting
the field of play during a game is n't like that
" " we 've tracked @entity5 games right through the @entity5 , and as the competition grows , the kids throw curveballs up to 70 % of the time , " @entity117 , @entity94 's director of research and co-author of the @entity83 study , told @entity121
" it 's good that @entity7 have enacted rules on pitch counts , but for say , a kid in the @entity136 ( @entity135 ) , if you see an unusually developed curveball at an early age , who knows the mileage on that arm ? " @entity108 says , " the kid who throws all those curve balls in the @entity5 is a hero
but does he ever get a change to earn a college scholarship or sign a major league contract ? do you want to take a chance on your son or daughter to get a college scholarship ? do you want to be a hero at 13 or 14 but never much else after that ? " surgery on the rise for young players ? even though @entity5 has instituted new pitch count rules , @entity94 says @entity83 has performed about seven times the number of arm operations on young pitchers that he did 15 years ago
so why not err on the side of caution and take @entity83 ' advice ? " ( @entity83 ) himself will say that is an opinion of his , and is not based on any empirical data , " @entity42 says
" there was n't any evidence in this study
it 's a fine distinction between the two
" " @entity5 has always been the leader in sports safety
we make changes in our sport based on data , not on feelings
we act out of scientific evidence , " he says
however , @entity83 ' office does agree that kids who pitched while fatigued are 36 times more likely to have serious arm problems
some 2.6 million kids play @entity5 baseball all over the world
parents often are sizing up the competition for their 10 - to 13 - year - olds for future high school teams and college scholarships , and believe their kids should play as much as possible to improve their chances
@entity5 officials admit too much baseball is not healthy
" kids play year - round now , " @entity42 says
" kids should n't be playing year - round in anything
if a parent is making a 10 - year - old do that ... it will make them hate the game by the time they are 16 or 17 years old
" @entity83 ' group is n't alone on its curveball stance
dr. @entity203 , director of the @entity204 at @entity205 , told the @entity206 in april that he still believes the curveball is best not thrown until a pitcher is at least 14
he also said kids should n't attempt to throw a slider , a pitch that puts even more stress on the elbow , until 16
@entity214 , an @entity215 - based pitching instructor and former scout for the @entity217 and the @entity218 , gave my son the same guidance in years of lessons
my son went on to pitch for @entity224 @entity223
dr. @entity225 , an @entity226 orthopedic surgeon who is the @entity227 ' physician , told the @entity228 this spring he performs 150 elbow ligament reconstructions a year
" seventy percent of those surgeries are pitchers who have n't hit college yet , " @entity225 said
" i ask each one the same question : when did you start throwing curveballs ? and they say : ' i was 10
' sometimes , it 's 9
" five years ago , i attended a coaches ' clinic at @entity240 that included the coaches and trainers of @entity240 and the @entity217
at the time , @entity240 had a team that counted and documented every pitch of the televised @entity5
team members noted an increase in the use of the curveball every season
@entity83 appeared in a video message , and all at the clinic agreed no one under 14 should be throwing the curveball
if you are watching the @entity5 as a baseball purist , that sweeping hook of the curve can be a thing of beauty
but take a good look at the kids throwing them now
chances are , you may not see them throw it or any other pitches without major surgery needed before they reach high school
so i will ask @entity5 again : why not ban the curveball ?
