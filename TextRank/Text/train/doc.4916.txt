@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's highest court friday ordered president @entity4 to ensure the @entity6 country holds elections by the end of july
chief justice @entity9 said that out of a nine - judge panel only two had dissented to the ruling he delivered
opinion : @entity6 's rocky road to democracy @entity4 " is hereby ordered and directed to proclaim dates for presidential , general elections ... which elections should take place not later than 31 july 2013 , " he said in a packed @entity17 chamber
the ruling was made after a former journalist with a defunct daily newspaper asked the court to order @entity4 to call for elections by end of june
@entity1 's parliament expires automatically on june 29 but @entity4 would have had until october 31 to hold elections
earlier this week the country 's finance minister , @entity28 , told journalists that @entity1 was struggling to raise the $ 132 million needed for conduct elections
the elections -- to be held under a new constitution endorsed in a referendum in march -- will end the power - sharing government of @entity4 and prime minister @entity35 formed in 2009
that followed a violence - marred election in 2008 in which @entity4 had claimed victory but regional leaders regarded as a sham
a new constitution was one of the conditions set by regional leaders before fresh elections
the new constitution limits the president to two five - year terms
@entity4 , 89 , has been in power since 1980 , when @entity1 attained independence from @entity50 , but may seek another term because the new charter does not apply retroactively .
