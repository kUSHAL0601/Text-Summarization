-- record - breaking cold across the @entity1
record - breaking heat in @entity3
makes you wonder what 's up with @entity6
for example , @entity8 heat made news all week -- for better or worse
@entity3 saw a record - setting winter heat wave , but on friday , gov. @entity12 delivered the bad news : he declared a drought emergency , after seeing little rain since 2012
that announcement came two days after @entity17 , @entity3 , reached 83 degrees wednesday , smashing a record for the date by 8 degrees
at the other extreme , it was just last week that a polar vortex delivered some of the coldest temperatures in two decades to the @entity1 and @entity25
have @entity26 and @entity6 gone @entity27 on us ? as it turns out , there 's nothing sinister at work
it 's natural variability , meteorologists say
" it happens every year , it just varies in intensity , " said @entity36 , a @entity0 weather producer
last year in mid-january , many @entity39 were wondering why it was so warm compared to most years
but now it 's the opposite -- well , for much of the country
it depends on where you live in relation to the jet stream
the jet stream is a ribbon of wind that flows west to east high across the globe , typically at 110 mph , although its speed can often top 200 mph
think of it as an aerial highway along which storms travel along
but the jet stream fluctuates north and south
it drives our temperature variability daily
one day you might be below a ridge in the jet stream and its warmth , and days later , a trough or dip will send brrrrr - utality your way
the @entity68 says climatologists in recent years observe a more wavy pattern to the jet stream , bringing outbreaks of colder weather to the areas of the @entity75 -- including the @entity39 and @entity76
" whether this is normal randomness or related to the significant climate changes occurring in the @entity80 is not entirely clear , especially when considering individual events , " @entity68 says on its climate.gov website
it 's something @entity83 meteorologist @entity83 talked about last week when asked to explain the polar vortex that was leading to the coldest temperatures in many states in decades
when asked if it was a side effect of global warming , his response was , it 's under review
" this is a hotly researched topic
in short , yes , it could be , " he said
" it seems counter-intuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one , but some research shows that it could
" we know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet , melting of the @entity104 , etc. this includes extreme distortions of the jet stream , which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter , " he said
@entity110 , the president of the @entity111 , says more study is needed on whether @entity80 warming will have a big effect on northern climates
in nature , air north of the jet stream is cold , and to the south it is warmer
but the @entity80 is getting warmer
" we 're relaxing or loosening that difference in temperature and that changes the jet stream and loosens it some , " he told viewers of a @entity124 video chat last week
" i think this is an area we have to look ( at ) ... closely in the science
i think it is quite plausible
" he agreed it 's too early to say with certainty
but a study by @entity138 of @entity140 's department of atmospheric science found no support for the increased temperatures in the @entity80 leading to additional slow - moving weather patterns
she described the relationship between the @entity80 and the weather to its south as " complex
" in the study , published last august , she said there are likely influences from other parts of the world and internal variability
as scientists press ahead in their research , this month 's jet stream reached far down to the @entity159 , bringing such frigidity that @entity1 resorted to outlandish experiments , such as tossing a cup of boiled water into the outdoor air and watching it turn to snow
finally this week , a weather ridge in the @entity8 pushed the jet stream back into @entity169 , to the relief of many @entity39
@entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .
