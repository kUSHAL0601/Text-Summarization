-- how did @entity1 manage to build a tablet computer for less than the $ 199 price tag ? according to analysts ' estimates , the company could n't
in order to meet the low asking price , @entity1 will sell the @entity10 at a loss when it debuts on november 15 , analysts said
the @entity13 's largest retailer is apparently aiming to make up the costs by selling other goods , as it and other retail giants such as @entity17 often do
each @entity18 costs $ 209.63 to build , which includes paying for parts and manufacturing , according to technology research firm @entity21
that amount does not factor in research - and - development investments or marketing , executives for the firm have said
the preliminary estimate is typically based on analysts ' talks with people in the supply chain and does not change significantly once @entity21 is able to tear down the hardware for a thorough report , executives say
shortly after @entity1 's announcement on wednesday , @entity35 analyst @entity34 sent a note to investors saying @entity1 is likely to lose $ 50 on each sale of the fire
when factoring in marketing and other costs , @entity42 's estimate could jibe with @entity21 's
another analyst group , @entity45 , says the parts cost $ 150 , not including assembly
even if this estimate is accurate , the margins for @entity1 would be razor thin
@entity1 is making a potentially expensive entrance into the tablet market with its aggressively priced tablet
the company could make up for the losses with digital sales or physical products bought through its online store using the tablet
it could also heavily market the @entity62 club subscription to @entity18 customers
@entity66 , over what timeframe @entity1 will recoup its costs is unclear
" we 're very excited about tablet computers , " @entity1 ceo @entity69 said in a television interview last year , " because they have great web browsers , and they make it easier for people to shop at @entity1
" factoring in projections for all of the e-books , music and video that customers will likely purchase for the device , @entity1 is expected to turn a profit of $ 10 per @entity18 , @entity21 said in a statement
by contrast , @entity86 's @entity85 2 , the most popular tablet , costs $ 333.25 to make , @entity21 says
the @entity85 costs at least $ 499 at stores
not including @entity86 's expensive marketing campaigns , that 's more than $ 100 in profit on each sale with better margins for the more expensive models that have larger storage capacities
the strategy to lowball the price of a sought - after product in order to " upsell " customers on other merchandise is common for retailers , but is less so in electronics hardware
@entity104 has found buyers after slashing the price of its touchpad tablet to $ 99 , which it only did because the company is discontinuing the product
however , the business strategy is not unheard of
@entity113 was able to break into the video - game market by selling the original @entity115 , then the most powerful console , at a loss
in the next game generation , it took @entity120 years for the @entity122 's manufacturing costs to come close to catching the price customers paid
in that industry , console makers reap licensing fees from game software publishers
@entity1 , too , can try to make up its losses on software
it hosts an app store , digital music retailer , streaming video service and bookstore , all of which it takes a cut from
not to mention the piles of nondigital stuff @entity1 sells to be delivered to customers ' doors
the only thing missing from the @entity18 is an app to let the delivery person in .
