growing up , @entity0 hoped to escape poverty by finishing school and becoming a teacher
but now 52 years old and having never finished school , she wishes she had learned a few things
" if i knew back then about the choices in family planning , i would 've been able to control having children , " said @entity6 , who has 12 children
" if it were up to me , i would n't want to have so many
but i did n't use family planning , so basically they just kept coming and coming
" she eventually heard about the birth control pill from neighbors , but did not know how it worked
moreover , she said she could not afford it
" instead of spending money on those , i use it to buy food , " @entity6 said
her story is a familiar one in a country where 81 % of @entity25 are devout @entity26 and 30 % live below the poverty line , according to the @entity29
while contraception is legal , the majority , like @entity6 , do not have access or the means to afford birth control
but that could all change
after 14 years in limbo , a controversial landmark legislation called the @entity40 bill could bring major changes in the country of almost 96 million people
the proposed law requires the government to provide contraceptives , information on modern family planning methods at public health centers and comprehensive reproductive health curriculum in schools
national surveys show 65 - 70 % of @entity25 support the bill , but it faces fierce opposition by the country 's @entity26 leaders
lawmakers are trying to negotiate a compromise , by addressing some of the strongest objections to the bill
the bill 's co-author congressman @entity62 stated that amendments are in the works to emphasize that reproductive health services and information would be geared to the " poorest and most marginalized households
" " in order to obviate the unfounded criticism that the government will distribute contraceptives for free to everyone , the amendments will underscore that only the poorest of the poor will have free access to contraceptives if they are willing acceptors , " @entity62 said in a press release
a dozen children in @entity6 's small home in @entity85 , a poor neighborhood in @entity86 , she and her family sleep , cook and eat inside one room
seventeen people share a cramped 12 - square meter room , one person next to another
although limited in space , the room has a sense of order
an array of slippers in different sizes sits next to the front door
the family has one mattress and the rest sleep on the floor , covered with cardboard , mats and blankets
two pieces of plywood serve as a bed and a desk for one of her children
during the interview , her sleeping grandchild curled next to her teenage father , using a pair of adult shorts as a blanket
the walls are covered in family photos
@entity6 is most proud of the school pictures showing three of her children , which bear the word " graduate , " showing that they finished elementary school
@entity6 hopes that unlike herself , her children will have choices
national statistics show that the @entity25 population is growing at 1.98 % and that it could reach 105 million by 2016
the growth rate is not the problem , said @entity136 , the @entity25 representative to the @entity137
" it 's about the quality of life available to the segment of the population having the most children , " she said
" poor women are the ones having more children
so as the @entity25 population is growing , it 's growing poorer
" @entity6 first became pregnant at 17
since then , she ca n't recall when she did not struggle to provide basic needs for their children
her husband , a carpenter does not have steady work
" if we earn money , they eat , " she said , referring to her children
" if we do n't , they have nothing to eat all day
most days they just bear with it
even when they go to school without food
" " i find it so hard when they go to school without food , without money
i just want to cry most times
" with no one else to care for her growing family , @entity6 stayed home to watch her children
her adult children struggle to find work , because they did n't graduate from high school
" the older ones had to stop going to school so the younger ones could start " , @entity6 said
but her children appear to be entangled in a familiar cycle
just like @entity6 , her daughter became pregnant at 17
her son became a father when he was 18 , and her 17 - year - old son is expecting a child soon
the health bill , @entity6 said , would give her youngest the means to " understand what happens with their bodies
" young people in the @entity25 lack health services and education , said @entity136 from the @entity137
this has caused a problem of skyrocketing teen pregnancy rates in the @entity25 , which are the second highest in @entity199
" we are also failing the young people in the @entity25 , " she said
" ideally it 's a time when young people are focused on education and skills - the things they need to live productive lives
instead , we have a situation where children are having children
" a pack of condoms cost about 50 pesos and upwards , and birth control pills start at 100 pesos
when @entity6 's husband can find work , he earns about 350 pesos a day
condoms are sold in convenience stores and groceries , and pills are available , but they 're harder to find in remote areas
the health bill would make various forms of birth control free and available to the country 's poor
it would help quell the dramatic rise in maternal mortality rates , which has increased from 11 women dying per day to 15 , from 2006 to 2010 , said @entity136
it would also help address the fact that the @entity25 is one of seven countries in the world where @entity236 rates are increasing , according to a @entity137 report
proponents of the @entity40 bill say it is about human rights , health and sustainable human development , not religion and sex
church resistance the @entity26 hierarchy has seen the bill differently - saying that artificial birth control is a sin and its distribution will relax moral standards
" preventing fertilization is not a surgical , but a chemical or medical abortion , " said father @entity254 , executive secretary of the @entity255 , of the @entity256 of @entity25
" it 's like okay , go ahead
as long as you do n't get pregnant or you do not impregnate anyone , you can have any physical relationship
it will destroy the trend of marriage in our country
and slowly when you bring down the bar of morality , everything follows
" @entity254 said the government is infringing on territory beyond its authority by " legislating an immoral law , " and maintained that the state should not intervene in the moral and religious realm
but @entity6 , who is catholic and regular church - goer disagreed
with a faded print of @entity282 and the @entity283 hanging on a wall behind her , the mother of 12 said , " the choice is yours if you need them for your own family , your own life
when you use them , it 's not like you 've sided with evil
" the battle over the health bill has both @entity297 officials and lawmakers accusing each other of overstepping boundaries between church and state
the bill in its previous five attempts at passage , has languished in @entity306
the stiff resistance from the @entity26 , which is influential in politics , has prevented the passage of the bill , said @entity311 , national chairperson of the @entity312 , which supports the health bill
in the past , politicians have hesitated openly supporting the bill in fear of going against the @entity26 and damaging their chances of re-election , she said
" legislators are called on regularly by bishops , one by one , and some priests visit legislators in their districts , to ' convince them ' to drop support or strengthen their opposition to the bill , " she said
for years , politicians have feared the @entity26 's moral influence on voters , said @entity330 , professor emerita at @entity331 , @entity332
" there are two kinds of @entity26 in the @entity25 , the unthinking - who say i do n't need to read that bill because my priest is the guardian of my morality and whatever they say goes
and the thinking -- who will study the issues , follow their own conscience , and do n't let anybody try to sway that , " she said
but father @entity254 denies that the church gets overly involved in politics
bishops issue guidelines when @entity26 decide whom to vote for , but they do not openly endorse political candidates , @entity254 said
" it 's up to the voters to ask themselves if this particular candidate possesses those needed criteria to lead our nation
" " in the final analysis , no one can stop the priest when they want to do it
but they will never be ordered to do so by the bishops , " he said
but @entity330 said the @entity25 is a different country today compared to when the bill first tried to fight its way to the legislative floor 14 years ago
" it 's no longer a one - sided , unidirectional situation , where the hierarchy says something , it goes down and everybody says ' amen , ' " she said
for @entity6 , a lifelong @entity297 , the issues are simpler
her greatest fear is that her children will end up trapped in the same life she has known
" i do n't want them to be like me , " she said
" i do n't want them to go through what i have
