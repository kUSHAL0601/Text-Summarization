-- famous for honest self - portraits , @entity2 artist @entity1 said that she painted her reality and that her paintings carried a message of pain
her life was full of it , both physical and emotional , and she used it to fuel her art. @entity1 was born in this house and lived in it with her husband , @entity15
much can be learned about both her private and public life by visiting the home she shared , first with her parents and later with her painter husband , @entity15
the bold blue house with red trim stands out in the quiet residential street of the @entity24 section of @entity25
it was painted that way because @entity1 and @entity15 felt that the bright colors represented @entity2 culture better than the original white paint
this home - turned - museum , known as @entity33 , is where @entity1 was born , began to paint and died , making the house a witness to one of the most important artistic lives in @entity2 history
the museum entrance leads to a large patio where pre-columbian sculptures collected by @entity15 throughout his lifetime are scattered among the plants and fountains
the couple 's love for traditional @entity2 art can be seen throughout the house , from the large fireplace designed by @entity15 that dominates the first room , resembling a step pyramid like the ones built by the @entity53 and @entity54 , to @entity1 's paintings and the couple 's collection of smaller sculptures
some of @entity1 's most well - known works , such as " @entity60 , " a still life of watermelons , are on display in the museum , but it is the personal objects that tell the most interesting stories
an entire room is dedicated to communist paraphernalia
@entity1 was very politically active and did not hide her political leanings
in fact , she and @entity15 invited exiled @entity73 communist revolutionary @entity72 and his wife to live with them in the late ' 30s
as visitors move through the museum , it is the remnants of @entity1 and @entity15 's private life that begin to tell their story
part of the collection is a bed with a mirror attached to it , used by @entity1 in order to create many of her celebrated self - portraits
at the age of 18 , she was left bedridden for a few months when her spine was broken in a serious bus and trolley accident
it was during those months that @entity1 began to paint , to help pass the time and keep her spirits up
also on view are several corsets that @entity1 had to wear during her lifetime because of lasting injuries from the accident , several surgeries and a childhood bout of polio
it was because she began painting that @entity1 met @entity15 , who was at the time a famous @entity2 muralist
@entity1 wanted to know whether she had talent enough to make art a career , so she sought out @entity15 to get his opinion
that was the start of their famously tempestuous relationship
they were married for the first time in 1929 , but after infidelities on both sides ( including an affair between @entity1 and @entity72 ) , they divorced in 1939
they were married again a year later
she once commented on their relationship , saying that there had been two great accidents in her life , the trolley and @entity15 ; @entity15 , she claimed , had been the worst of the two
the house , which was witness to the birth of @entity1 on july 6 , 1907 , was also witness to her death july 13 , 1954
@entity15 put her ashes in a @entity133 urn , which remains in the house to this day
he donated the house in 1957 , and it opened to the public as @entity33 , @entity33 in 1958
so the blue house , which has seen so much of the history of two of @entity25 's most famous artists and was witness to so much of @entity1 's personal suffering , is open to the public , ready to tell their story to all who are willing to listen .
