-- the morning three women won the @entity2 , @entity3 was tired from a night spent strategizing about how to stop rape and other sexual violence toward women in war
@entity3 won the prize in 1997 for her work to ban land mines
thursday night , she 'd joined other female @entity12 winners and peace advocates in @entity14
they belong to a group associated with the @entity16 , founded in 2006 by female laureates and activists
as the news broke friday about the 2011 winners , @entity3 was just getting out of bed
" my husband is already on his computer , and i hear him say , ' woah ! three women ! ' " @entity3 rushed to him and peered at the monitor
@entity28 president @entity27 , activist @entity29 of @entity28 and rights activist @entity30 of @entity31
on television , a @entity12 official explained the decision to award the prize jointly
the women were chosen " for their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights ... " we can not achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence development of all levels of society , " he said
she knows @entity29 , she said , and loved that the @entity2 was being given to three women , raising the total number of women who have individually won the prize to 15 , according to the prize 's official site
only nine @entity59 are still living , according to the @entity60
" @entity29 is incredibly powerful and sure of herself , " @entity3 told @entity0
" she has no trouble dealing with the media
i can imagine she is stunned and yet excited and recognizes how much this changes what she does
" @entity3 was startled in 1997 when she got the call that she had won
looking out her window at 5 a.m. that day in october , she saw reporters camped out on her gravel driveway in @entity70
though she knew she was on the @entity2 short list , she had n't believed she would win
@entity3 assumed the award would go to more prominent people within the organization where she worked
as an introvert , she said , she was worried
but she managed to do interview after interview that day
the spotlight has n't dimmed as time has passed
" it was a lot of attention all at once , which was hard for me personally , but it was incredible for the campaign and that was the important thing , " she said
the @entity86 launched in 1992 with six nongovernmental organizations and grew to more than 1,000 @entity88 in more than 60 countries
within six years , @entity3 told @entity0 , the campaign succeeded in getting an international treaty banning the weapons
the campaign worked with government , @entity96 bodies and the @entity97
the agreement came during the diplomatic conference in @entity100 , @entity101 , in september 1997
she was awarded the @entity12 a month later
@entity3 predicts that the @entity12 awarded to two relatively unknown female activists will put more focus on democratic uprisings in the @entity106 and @entity107
and it will make @entity30 a visual representation of the @entity110
" that is going to be totally intense , " @entity3 said
" but it 's awesome
" it will be impossible for these @entity2 winners and the women they represent to be tamped down or forgotten or told what to do as the movements in their countries unfold and slowly resolve , @entity3 said
" you ca n't have them go back into the kitchen once they 've overthrown the dictator , " @entity3 said
giving the @entity12 to all the women at once signals a declaration of sorts to the world
it says : we 're not going back
we are stronger in numbers
sharing the prize , as two @entity134 peace activists have in the past , does not diminish the honor , @entity3 stressed
she has heard criticism to that point and believes it 's important to quash that mentality
" they were jointly recognized because each of them has done significant work nonviolently to being about democratic change to stop violence against women , " @entity3 said
women tend to work together , she added
it seems fitting that they share the prize
@entity3 offered advice to the women who won friday : remain true to yourself , she said
" these women would n't have been recognized if they were not really clear about who they are , what they believe and what they are willing to do to demonstrate their belief through action
