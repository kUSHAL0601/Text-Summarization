@entity0 -- the @entity2 refused to indicate monday whether president @entity3 will issue a posthumous pardon for @entity5 , the @entity6 boxing champion convicted in 1913 for dating a white woman
@entity5 's 1910 defeat of @entity9 , the " @entity10 , " sparked riots
the @entity12 on july 29 unanimously passed a resolution urging @entity3 to grant a pardon ; the @entity15 passed a similar measure by a voice vote on june 24
the push for a rare posthumous pardon has been spearheaded for years by sen. @entity20 , @entity21 , and rep. @entity22 , @entity24 - @entity23 , two of @entity26 ' top boxing enthusiasts
" it is our hope that you will be eager to agree to right this wrong and erase an act of racism that sent an @entity6 citizen to prison , " they wrote friday in a letter to @entity3
@entity5 , the first @entity6 to win the heavyweight title , was convicted for violating the @entity36 , which outlawed the transportation of women across state lines for " immoral " purposes
he served 10 months in prison on charges " brought forward clearly to keep him away from the boxing ring , where he continued to defeat his white opponents , " @entity20 and @entity22 said
almost a century after @entity5 's conviction , his compelling saga has continued to capture the interest of sports writers , civil rights activists and historians
it provides , they agree , a unique window into @entity6 politics and culture at a time when @entity59 - style racism reigned supreme
@entity5 was first arrested for breaking the @entity36 in 1912 , four years after winning the heavyweight crown
that case fell apart , but investigators soon after charged him with a similar offense involving a woman he had dated years earlier
@entity67 lawyers argued it was a " crime against nature " for him to have a sexual relationship with a white woman
judge @entity72 , later to become the first commissioner of @entity74 , set @entity5 's bail at $ 30,000 , the equivalent of more than $ 660,000 today
when a bail bondsman showed up , @entity72 jailed him , too , according to an account that filmmaker @entity79 relays in his documentary " @entity81 : the @entity82 of @entity5
" an all - white jury convicted @entity5 in less than two hours
" mr. @entity5 was perhaps persecuted as an individual , but ... it was his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the intermarriage of whites and blacks , " one of the prosecutors later said
@entity5 's real crime , in the eyes of many , was committed on july 4 , 1910 , when he successfully defended his boxing title against @entity9 , a white boxer who came to be called the " @entity10 " because many white fans saw him as the best chance to wrest back a boxing title from the @entity6 - @entity6 champ
@entity5 beat @entity9 , who had come out of retirement for the fight , before a stunned , almost entirely white crowd in @entity103 , @entity104
more than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured
so when they " could n't beat him in the ring , the white power establishment decided to beat him in the courts , " @entity79 said in his documentary
@entity5 fled to @entity115 in 1913 while free on appeal
but after years of fights overseas , including the eventual loss of his title in @entity120 , @entity121 , in 1915 , @entity5 came home
he turned himself over to @entity124 authorities at the @entity126 border in 1920 and served 10 months in prison
he died in a car wreck in 1946
" back then , if you were black and you were told that you did something wrong , you really had no recourse , " @entity129 , @entity5 's great - niece , recently told @entity1
" you just accepted what was done because black people were basically powerless and voiceless
@entity5 may have been a rich boxer , but he could n't fight the system
" @entity20 and @entity22 introduced resolutions calling for a presidential pardon in 2005 and last year
@entity20 , who says he made a mistake by once voting against a federal holiday for the rev. @entity141 , sees the pardon as a way to right an old wrong
" the @entity5 case is an ignominious stain on our nation 's history , " he said on the @entity15 floor in the spring
" rectifying this injustice is long overdue
[ the resolution recognizes ] the unjustness of what transpired , and sheds light on the achievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice
