-- the ubiquity of the " @entity2 " is staggering
more than 18 million copies have sold since the @entity4 -- when a @entity6 widow named @entity7 published her recipes and anecdotes in the hope of lifting @entity12 's spirits
and while the lemonade concoctions and tuna casserole recipes were delicious , the real secret of the cookbook 's success is n't that it soothed stomachs ; it 's that it catered to hearts and minds
the artist of life @entity7 's young life was uniquely charmed
she was born in 1877 to wealthy @entity25 immigrants and spent her teenage years shuttling between her hometown of @entity27 and the elegant port city of @entity29 , @entity25
after enjoying a brief tryst with novelist @entity31 , @entity7 settled down and married an attorney , with whom she raised two children
although never employed , she thought of herself as an " artist of life , " a renaissance woman who aspired to live vibrantly and suck the marrow out of every moment
when the stock market crashed in 1929 , @entity7 's spirit was put to the test
her husband , who 'd long suffered from depression , committed suicide
but instead of wallowing in grief , the 54 - year - old widow found meaning in a project -- writing a cookbook she titled " the @entity2 : a collection of reliable recipes with a @entity51
" once completed in 1931 , she spent half her savings to publish the book locally in @entity27
friends and acquaintances tested the recipes , and the feedback was encouraging , so she began pitching it to major publishers
five years later , in 1936 , @entity61 finally took a chance on it and agreed to distribute the " @entity2 " nationwide
the truth is that @entity7 had never been a great chef , but she was an excellent hostess
she could whip up a party at a moment 's notice and keep all of her guests entertained
by infusing the " @entity2 's " text with that same wit and conviviality , @entity7 set her cookbook apart
from the first page , she skipped the kitchen basics in favor of extolling the virtues of cocktails : " they loosen tongues and unbutton the reserves of the socially diffident
serve them by all means , preferably in the living room , and the sooner the better
" @entity7 's @entity25 heritage also deeply influenced early editions of the book
the first @entity87 includes recipes for dishes such as blitzkuchen and linzer tortes and even a few rousing quotes from @entity92
@entity7 also exhibited an endearing frankness with her readers
unlike any other cookbook narrator at the time , @entity7 admitted to her lack of expertise and joked about not having time to cook
in one section , she wrote , " the @entity25 recipe reads , ' stir for one hour , ' but of course , no high - gear @entity12 has time for that
" simply stated , @entity7 knew her audience
@entity0 : 10 foods that are aphrodisiacs @entity87 and depression other than maybe " @entity109 , " no book grasped the hardships of the @entity4 better than the " @entity2
" @entity7 understood that @entity12 housewives were struggling to put food on the table , and she addressed those challenges head on
many entries began with the tag " inexpensive and good
" there was even an appendix on making the most of leftovers , including stale bread , bones , coffee grounds , and pickle vinegar
along with these tidbits , @entity7 also included the food preferences of celebrities and monarchs
" is there anything better than good coffee cake ? " she wrote
" i am told that the former king of @entity133 ' dunks
' " these asides bore little culinary relevance , but they made readers believe they shared something in common with royalty and celebrities
follow this recipe , @entity7 hinted , and you 're making the same sponge cake that @entity143 once made for @entity144 when he was under the weather
as the country marched off to @entity147 , the " @entity2 " adapted to the times
@entity7 's 1943 edition was the first major cookbook to address the issue of rationing
once again , she treated cutbacks as opportunities for innovation , creating recipes such as @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159
she even gave soybeans top billing , featuring them as a prime substitute for meat
@entity0 : food challenges for the @entity166 family tradition by 1951 , @entity7 was in her seventies , so her daughter , @entity169 , took over the bulk of her work
in some ways , @entity169 was even more of a visionary than her mother , and many of her choices for the 1951 " @entity2 " helped transform it into the classic it is today
for example , to illustrate techniques and ingredients , @entity169 added 150 line drawings
she could have chosen trendy photographs , but her decision to use simple , helpful sketches ensured that the book would feel timeless
by contrast , the technicolor cakes and sweaty roast turkeys of 1950 's " @entity191 's @entity190 " now feel dated
@entity169 also introduced a simple lowercase font for the logo
at the time , this was an understated choice ; today , it 's an icon of cookery
like her mother , @entity169 also drew inspiration from the national mood
when the next edition of @entity87 was commissioned in 1963 , the carefree consumer atmosphere of postwar @entity12 was over
doctors no longer plugged cigarettes on tv , and books such as @entity207 's " @entity206 " dominated the shelves
to address growing consumer awareness , @entity169 cut some of @entity7 's digressions to make way for more relevant information
she included a massive section titled " know your ingredients , " containing charts , diagrams , and exhaustive explanations on everything from the best way to beat eggs to how yeast works
the goal was to help readers understand not just the hows of cooking , but the whys , as well
@entity169 also wanted @entity12 to eat healthier , so she added nutritional advice to the pages of @entity87
plagued by undiagnosed food allergies as a child , she understood the link between ingredients and wellness years before people started talking about " organic farming " and " health food
" although the book still contained plenty of recipes for condensed - soup casseroles , 1963 's @entity87 suggested using fresh , seasonal fruits and vegetables instead of canned or frozen produce
in an era of @entity247 , @entity169 pushed for whole grains
@entity169 produced her last revision in 1975 with the help of her husband , @entity252 , and son , @entity254
the work was a monumental tome , containing more than 4,500 recipes and 1,000 illustrations
thanks to its encyclopedic size , this edition became the resource not only for grandmothers searching for @entity25 chocolate cake recipes , but also for their hippie grandchildren looking for tips on granola
presciently , the book warned readers against overusing microwaves , which were embraced by most major cookbooks at the time
( off the record , @entity169 actually wrote to @entity274 that she believed microwaves were zapping the nutritional value from food
) the 1975 @entity87 was considered so authoritative that it remained in print for more than 20 years
@entity0 : secret menu items at fast food restaurants today 's tastes in 1997 , @entity282 hired a team of chefs to write a completely new @entity87 without any input from the @entity169 family
critics slammed the edition for being sterile and lacking any sense of playfulness
in 2006 , the publisher made amends
@entity293 and his wife , @entity294 , were put in charge of the 75th anniversary edition , creating a new version that combined @entity169 's conscientiousness with her mother 's sense of fun
instead of catering to weight - loss fads ( the authors thank heaven that low - carb diets are no longer in vogue ) , the latest @entity87 stresses moderation and balance
the classic , gut - busting @entity25 cakes are still there , but they share space with homemade energy bars
@entity169 would be proud that ethnic cooking is finally represented on a level that reflects our culture , with recipes for hummus , cream cheese balls , and salsa on neighboring pages
meanwhile , her mother would be happy that cocktails are back , along with old , quirky recipes , such as @entity324 for 100 people
and the tidbits are classically @entity7
for example : " the @entity327 , who were passionate about snails , grew them on ranches where they were fed special foods like bay leaves , wine , and spicy soups as pre-seasoning
" but to really grasp the spirit of the " @entity2 , " one needs only to look at the index of the latest edition , which begins with a @entity342 quote
it reads , " knowledge is of two kinds
we know a subject ourselves , or we know where we can find information on it
" @entity7 would be proud
