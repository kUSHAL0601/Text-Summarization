for weeks leading up to the 2013 off - year elections , prominent @entity1 @entity0 directly blamed the state 's new voter id law for problems in registration
first , judge @entity7 said she had a problem because the name on her driver 's license and the name on her voter registration card did not match
it turns out she had left her maiden name on her voter registration
it also turns out that it is the individual 's responsibility to ensure that his or her voter information is up to date
@entity7 was able to vote
then , state sen. @entity20 , the presumed @entity0 nominee for @entity1 governor , said she had a problem , too
like @entity7 , the name on her driver 's license did not match the name on her registration card
she signed an affidavit , which the polling place provided , and was able to vote
then , nearer @entity29 , former speaker of the house @entity30 said that he , too , had a problem voting
he said the @entity33 would not give him a voter id card
but @entity30 , who is 90 , tried to use an expired driver 's license , which for most voters serves as their photo @entity34
how is this the fault of the state or anyone who supports voter id ? @entity30 got his card by going home and finding his birth certificate , and was able to vote
we know of these stories because all three prominent @entity0 took those voting problems straight to the media
what we do not know from these three stories is how the voter id law actually affected turnout
@entity0 who oppose voter id have consistently claimed that it suppresses votes
if they are correct , then @entity1 should have seen turnout drop off in 2013 compared with the closest comparable election
the 2013 election in @entity1 was an off - year , constitutional amendment election
@entity1 holds constitutional amendment elections every two years , after its legislative sessions , to give @entity62 the opportunity to approve or reject items that the legislature has approved for a vote
the @entity1 secretary of state administers elections and posts totals going back to 1992
according to the @entity1 secretary of state 's office , 10 amendments were up for vote in 2011 , the last constitutional amendment election before the voter id law passed
some issues received more votes than others
the one most voted on received 690,052 votes , for and against
overall , an average of about 672,874 @entity62 voted on these 10 constitutional amendments
if voter id suppressed votes , we should see a drop in turnout , right ? well , according to the @entity1 secretary of state 's office , nine amendments went up for vote in 2013
the amendment that attracted the most votes , @entity92 , attracted 1,144,844
the average number of votes cast in 2013 was 1,099,670
so , in terms of raw votes , turnout in 2013 increased by about 63 % over turnout in 2011 in comparable elections
how about in areas the anti-voter @entity34 side predicted should see " suppression " ? turnout for the 2011 election was 5.37 % of registered voters ; for 2013 it was about 8 %
@entity0 allege that voter @entity34 will suppress the vote in predominantly @entity109 regions
@entity110 sits on the @entity112 border and is 90 % @entity109
in 2011 , an average of just over 4,000 voted in the constitutional amendment election
in 2013 , an average of over 16,000 voted
if voter id was intended to suppress votes , it is failing as spectacularly as @entity119
look at @entity120 , which is about 85 % @entity109
turnout increased from an average of 4,700 votes in 2011 to 5,100 in 2013
so in its first real - world test , @entity1 ' voter id law -- which 66 % of @entity62 support , according to a 2012 @entity127 poll -- had no impact on suppressing the vote
it even can be argued that voter @entity34 helped increase turnout
turnout was up , and in fact , the 2013 constitutional amendment election saw the highest constitutional amendment election turnout in @entity1 in about eight years
opponents of voter id must come up with a new line to attack it
the old dog that it suppresses the vote just wo n't hunt
join us @entity143 / @entity142 .
