i was saddened to learn of the passing of @entity3 , a fellow space traveler because he helped make the journey into the final frontier accessible to us all
@entity3 's mr. @entity9 in the original " @entity13 " television show , followed by the series of movies , proved to be a seminal , enduring and endearing character
while the late @entity17 's " one small step for man , " as we began our exploration of the @entity20 back in july 1969 , is ageless , so , too , is @entity9 's iconic " live long and prosper , " a phrase that also spans time and space
it brought out the @entity25 in all of us ; that , for me , translated into a peaceful progression of exploring the vastness of outer space for all mankind
@entity3 's quite logical and always calm @entity9 struck me as an ideal person to have with us onboard a spaceship headed into the unknown
i also admit to being jealous of how much room was available on the @entity35 -- far from the cramped quarters allotted space travelers of past , present and future ! fans honor @entity3 with tweets , @entity25 salute @entity3 's final communiqu√© to his fans read : " a life is like a garden
perfect moments can be had , but not preserved , except in memory , " followed by " @entity46 , " the acronym for live long and prosper
for all of us , @entity3 is in our collective memories as a passionate , inspirational and creative soul who beamed us all up on an enterprising voyage of exploration and discovery
be assured , there is a great need to reaffirm our country 's space exploration goals
thanks to mr. @entity9 , the stage is set -- in more ways than one -- to continue our voyage outward into deep space
during the next few years we must choose whether we rebound as a vibrant nation leading our global civilization toward a permanent presence beyond @entity70 , or relinquish @entity72 leadership in space
i recently testified before @entity75 , and in my opinion , there is no more convincing way to demonstrate @entity72 leadership for the remainder of this century than on july 20 , 2019 , the 50th anniversary of our landing on the moon , to commit to and strive toward a permanent human presence on @entity86
@entity87 : ' i loved @entity9 ' indeed , there are strange new worlds to explore -- to seek out new life and start new civilizations
it is time to boldly go where no man -- or woman -- has gone before
thanks to @entity3 and his beloved mr. @entity9 , the bar has been set high for us to continue humanity 's quest to probe outward in the universe .
