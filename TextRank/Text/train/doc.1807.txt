with negotiations for a longer - lasting cease - fire set to begin soon , many @entity0 returned to their neighborhoods tuesday while some remained at shelters not trusting the break in the violence
for now , a 72 - hour humanitarian pause is in place , allowing delegations to gather in @entity11 , @entity12 , to talk about how to make the truce last
for @entity16 's 1.8 million residents it also offered a chance to go to a street market for food and goods , or to check on abandoned homes
for @entity23 , where more than 2,300 rockets have landed since early july , there was , for a change , no sirens blaring
in @entity28 , one man told @entity29 he was happy the shooting had stopped , but his problems were just beginning
the man said he could n't understand what he was seeing -- the home his family invested $ 100,000 in , now destroyed
no insurance company will give him money to rebuild , he told @entity29
there are no winners in this war , he said
but on @entity42 , the @entity41 declared : " @entity43 accomplished
" the @entity41 said it had destroyed 32 tunnels -- many of which ran under the border into @entity23 -- during the four - week conflict
@entity23 says @entity50 militants used the tunnels to sneak into @entity23 for terror attacks
nearly 1,900 @entity53 have been killed in @entity16 during the conflict , according to the @entity54
it 's unclear how many were militants
the @entity57 estimates that about 70 % of the dead were civilians
but the @entity41 says it estimates about 900 militants were killed
@entity41 spokesman lt. col. @entity61 said it was a preliminary figure based on field reports from troops returning from battle
@entity23 officials have said 64 @entity23 soldiers and three civilians in @entity23 died in violence
' peace ? what peace ? ' after the cease - fire began , residents trickled into @entity74 , an area near @entity28 that experienced some of the most destructive violence of the conflict
they found craters and ruins where homes and shops once stood
people scaled crumbled concrete and twisted metal to rummage for any belongings left in the rubble
@entity87 , a ph.d. student whose family home was demolished , lamented the situation
" peace ? what peace ? we have no home , no water , no power , " he said
" there is no peace here
" residents were stunned as they returned to their neighborhoods for the first time since being displaced by the fighting
" after the cease - fire agreement took effect , the world will now see the level of destruction which should serve as an evidence of the level of crimes of the enemy , " @entity103 , a senior leader of @entity50 , said in a statement aired on @entity50 - run @entity106 television , according to a @entity29 translation
the conflict has displaced more than 200,000 people across the densely populated territory
residents are coming back to similar sights -- rubble , ruins , buildings pockmarked by shrapnel
a white - haired man , @entity127 , stood on the roof of his collapsed two - story home
" i am a wedding photographer , i have nothing to do with this war , " he said
" maybe if we had gotten some concessions , it would be worth it
" for the first time tuesday , the number of people packed into @entity57 shelters decreased , said @entity57 official @entity141 in @entity16
but not everyone left the @entity57 facilities
others were more pragmatic , thinking it best to wait and see
" they said there was a truce before and we left , " one man told @entity29
" but five minutes after we got home , the airstrikes started
" @entity23 released a map noting numerous sites it targeted in @entity74 , which it said " @entity50 used for military purposes
" the @entity41 said the map showed locations of tunnels , hideouts , rocket firings and launchings , and more
troop withdrawal " we have no forces within @entity16 , " @entity41 spokesman @entity61 told @entity29 tuesday
with its goal of demolishing the tunnels achieved , @entity23 announced the withdrawal of ground forces for what is supposed to be a three - day cease - fire with @entity50
@entity23 is implementing the @entity12 - brokered truce , which took effect tuesday morning , while maintaining " defensive positions " outside @entity16 , the @entity41 said
officials from the @entity57 and @entity175 , who have been pushing for a cease - fire for weeks , hope that the 72 - hour pause will allow negotiations to take place for a more lasting peace
why are so many civilians dying in @entity50 - @entity23 war ? meetings in @entity11 an @entity23 delegation arrived tuesday evening in @entity11 for negotiations , two senior @entity12 government officials told @entity29
the officials , who asked not to be named , said they expected indirect negotiations to begin wednesday , with the @entity12 officials acting as intermediaries
the two sides are not expected to talk directly to each other
@entity12 and @entity53 negotiators had arrived over the weekend
@entity197 to any talks , @entity23 government spokesman @entity195 said , is that @entity50 must disarm
@entity50 leaders say that they want to negotiate an end to the @entity23 blockade of @entity16 , or at least a body other than the @entity23 controlling the borders
@entity103 , the senior @entity50 leader , said his televised statement that @entity50 members will work with the @entity53 delegation to end the blockade
@entity23 : ' the onus is on @entity50 ' @entity23 repeatedly accepted an @entity12 cease - fire proposal during the conflict , which @entity50 rejected
temporary humanitarian cease - fires repeatedly crumbled , with each side blaming the other
" the onus is on @entity50 , " @entity195 told @entity29 of the 72 - hour truce
" we are entering this with our eyes open , " he said
" we have been burnt more than once
" the sentiment was similar from @entity50 spokesman @entity219 , who told @entity29 that as long as @entity23 honors the agreement , so will the @entity53
" we hope they can take it and be committed to a cease - fire , " he said
while @entity12 has not released details of the truce , @entity195 suggested it was the same agreement that @entity23 has accepted all along
the @entity175 urged both sides to honor the cease - fire agreement
" the @entity175 has been steadfast in our insistence on an end to rocket and tunnel attacks against @entity23 and an end to the suffering of the people of @entity16 , " @entity231 spokeswoman @entity230 said
@entity57 @entity246 ban ki - moon " urges the parties to commence , as soon as possible , talks in @entity11 on a durable ceasefire and the underlying issues , " his office said in a statement
@entity248 minister resigns over @entity16 in the latest example of the ripples the conflict has sent around the globe , a @entity248 government minister said she was resigning over her country 's policy on @entity16
" with deep regret i have this morning written to the prime minister & tendered my resignation
i can no longer support @entity262 policy on @entity16 , " @entity259 , senior minister of state at the @entity260 , wrote on @entity42
