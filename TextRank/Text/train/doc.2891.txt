@entity21 , who is chairman of the union , said that any tax should not be considered a " negative act
" @entity21 also expects a good year for @entity26 banks , estimating that net profits will grow at 15 % in 2013
he noted , however " the growth will not be equal in all countries
" the @entity4 , headquartered in @entity30 , @entity31 , was setup in 1974 to foster cooperation between @entity35 banks and support those in the region
@entity21 said : " i think the @entity1 banks will take the lead , spearheaded by banks in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity41 respectively
" he added : " that is mainly due to the huge government financed projects in these countries
" the bank union chief is less positive on @entity47 following the recent crisis that has engulfed the eurozone 's third - smallest economy , @entity51
@entity21 believes the euro will face " more problems " as a result of the political decisions made to solve the crisis in @entity51
@entity47 lawmakers initially proposed a levy on all depositors in the two biggest @entity51 banks , causing savers to panic and protest , in return for a 10 billion euro ( $ 12.8 billion ) bailout
he said : " the bailout deal will hit hard on them and this will lead into a serious problem , but i am afraid that more banks in other @entity47 countries will face similar issues

he said : " it is not only about laws and islamic banking products ; there should be an appropriate environment and solid follow up and control from the central bank
