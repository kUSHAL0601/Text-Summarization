-- the epiphany occurred at a baptism
with more than 800 people waiting , pastor @entity3 took them one by one and immersed them in the church 's baptism pool
during this spiritual rite at @entity10 , the pastors hold the people briefly underwater , and then pull them out
" on that particular day , i was baptizing 858 people , " @entity3 told his congregation last fall
" that took me literally four hours
" " as i 'm baptizing 858 people , along around 500 , i thought this ... ' we 're all fat
' " @entity3 turned his realization to himself
" but i thought , i 'm fat , " he said
" i 'm a terrible model of this
i ca n't expect our people to get in shape unless i do
" @entity3 , considered one of the most influential pastors in the country , delivered the inaugural prayer for president @entity28 in 2009 and wrote the best - selling book " @entity30
" now , he was embarking on a new mission : curbing the obesity epidemic at church
@entity3 seems like an unlikely man to lead an anti-obesity crusade
a ruddy man with plastic frame glasses , he has admitted to gaining 90 pounds over the last 30 years and failing at various yo - yo diets
he declined an interview for this story
based in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity10 is one of the largest churches in the @entity44 and has eight locations throughout @entity46
@entity3 has a casual style in his ministry , usually preaching in jeans
since january 2011 , @entity3 has been shrinking
he gave up carbonated drinks , dairy and fast food , he told the church
he works out twice a day , according to his trainer , @entity54
@entity3 shed 60 pounds on a diet - lifestyle program devised at @entity10 called the @entity56
the program 's name comes from the biblical story about @entity56
in the story , @entity56 and his friends , who are israelites living in @entity62 , refuse to consume royal food and wine
by eating vegetables and water , " they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food , " according to @entity56 in the @entity71 's @entity70
the @entity72 , which started at @entity10 last january , advises how to eat healthier foods , encourages workout routines and urges participants to join small groups
@entity3 recruited three doctors to develop the plan : @entity80 , a psychiatrist ; @entity81 , a family doctor ; and @entity83 , a tv host and cardiac surgeon
" the secret sauce of @entity10 is we do this as a community , " said @entity80 , one of the medical contributors
" it 's very different than most health plans where you do it with yourself or your wife
you get to do this with a whole community
" studies indicate that people who try to lose weight or adopt healthier habits in groups are more likely to be successful than individuals working independently
the small groups have health and spiritual curricula , and provide a support network
@entity10 was the ideal place , because small groups already existed at the church and @entity3 had " instantaneous capacity to make this happen , " said @entity81 , another contributor to the @entity56
" the church was the perfect incubator , " he said
" this was a way of leapfrogging and getting a social experiment done
" @entity118 , a member of @entity10 , said that having a small group was instrumental to her 125 - pound weight loss
her group met twice a month to discuss their health , and they also hiked together
each small group has a health champion , whom seals credits with " helping me emotionally , physically
" " the health champion guides the group -- ' this is what we 're cooking , this is what we 're doing ' -- and cheers you on and helps you out
it 's not just the food you 're eating , it 's also mental gain , " she said
the church held a race , cooking demonstrations and various workout classes led by @entity143 founder @entity142
it overhauled the menus and vending machine products sold at church and placed symbols to indicate which choices were healthy
doughnuts often given to the congregation were replaced with trail mix. the church developed a website with recipes , advice on physical activity and health information
" it 's not a diet , not a healthy quick scheme , it 's designed to be a way to create health , " @entity81 said
at the end of the first year , about 15,000 people had registered for the program and 250,000 pounds were lost , according to @entity10
the @entity56 is a program the founders intended to spread to different faith communities across the globe , @entity81 said
but many at @entity10 wondered why the church would get involved in health and weight loss
" i wondered whether this was something church should be doing , " said @entity175 , a member of @entity10 for 18 years
@entity175 and her husband decided to try the plan , because they had gained weight during his illness with multiple sclerosis
between his doctor 's visits , hospital appointments and busy schedule , the family came to rely on fast food as their staple
the couple and their two kids , ages 10 and 16 , cleaned out their pantry , gave up the @entity199 burgers and started cooking as a family activity
they started eating chicken , broccoli , squash and a variety of vegetables , and in smaller portions
they bought a trampoline for the kids and also started hiking
one year later , @entity175 has lost 28 pounds
her husband has lost 55 pounds and stopped taking as many medications
" this is what we should be doing , " @entity175 said about the church 's involvement in the health plan
" i am far more able to serve @entity219 because i 'm healthy
" @entity3 said in several speeches to the congregation that he never paid much attention to the perils of obesity such as diabetes and heart disease
but when he heard that obesity could affect a person 's brain power , it snapped him into action
growing evidence indicates that obesity is associated with impaired cognitive function , such as attention and memory problems
@entity3 often repeats the same phrases when discussing the @entity56
" the @entity239 made your body , @entity242 paid for your body , the spirit lives in your body
you better take care of it
