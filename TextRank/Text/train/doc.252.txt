-- my 65 - year - old father , @entity1 , was shot five times , knife in hand , as he wrestled with a domestic terrorist in the @entity7 of @entity8
the coward fled , leaving my father to pass away in a murmur of meditation
my father lived the @entity14 dream
starting with only a couple bucks in his pocket , he worked hard and long to make a life for his family and his community , helping to build the @entity21 temple where he was attacked
since that day , many discussions in our community have come and gone , with little attention from the majority of the national media or government
it seems many hard - earned lessons from this tragedy already have been forgotten
but they bear repeating and remembering
injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere
this attack was predicated on hate
too many hate groups exist right here in the @entity14 , and terror can take many forms : from school bullies to conservative radio hosts spreading fear and distortions to racists spewing hate
and , of course , to psychotic loners
violence has become part of @entity14 life
the @entity14 has the highest murder rate of affluent democracies
@entity14 had an extreme homicide rate of 5.4 per 100,000 people in 2008 - 2009 , compared with a 1.43 rate in @entity58 and @entity59 and a 1.3 rate in @entity61
the statistics differ somewhat every year , but the rate is always much higher in the @entity14 than in other affluent nations
@entity65 has less than a 10th of the @entity14 murder rate
since 1982 , @entity14 has seen at least 60 mass murders ( defined as at least four people being killed ) committed by guns
but violence does n't manifest only in the psychotic actions of a few
it seems to be part of the fabric of society , prevalent in entertainment and present in the " pre-emptive war " in @entity79 , waged on false information and funded by the @entity14 public
the coward -- i will never utter his name -- who so violated sacred ground and killed so many people was a product of a broken system
he spent six years in the armed forces , drank heavily and was a member of a white - power rock band
at some point , we must acknowledge and understand why this happens
in seems our system of education , our culture and our governance are failing somehow
president @entity100 , come to @entity101 on august 5 , the @entity14 dream was attacked
immigrants , whether naturalized -- like my father -- or not , have been treated as a second class for far too long
@entity108 - @entity14 and @entity109 immigrants shoulder the brunt of this sentiment
yet all people who are not caucasian and @entity113 most likely have felt this disregard , including african - americans , brought to this country against their own free will
conservatives who are anti-immigration add to the poison by denigrating foreigners more and more often
it is a sad and backward situation because immigrants are the lifeblood of this country , as @entity126 wrote so eloquently in his book , " @entity127
" " this was the secret of @entity14 : a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers ... , " @entity126 wrote
" every ethnic minority , in seeking its own freedom , helped strengthen the fabric of liberty in @entity14 life
similarly , every aspect of the @entity14 economy has profited from the contributions of immigrants
" this second - class status was further demonstrated when the national government and media seemed to lose interest in or concern about the shootings and the ensuing dialogue
maybe it was too much to take in after the massacre in a movie theater in @entity155 , @entity156
maybe this was not tragic enough to get prolonged attention
maybe politically , this is a powder keg
whatever the excuse , it is not good enough
@entity100 is coming to @entity101 , but she is not an elected official who is responsible for national policies that are at the core of this problem
on a sunday morning when devout @entity14 were getting ready for a sermon , they were slaughtered by a maniac who should have never been able to own a gun , given his history
no matter what was happening that week , it should have been top priority on any leader 's list to do something to acknowledge and help right this situation
the president should have made phone calls to representatives of the @entity21 community
the media should have sent their best and brightest to @entity8 to dissect the phenomenon of hate murders -- to its credit , @entity0 did
civil rights leaders would have done well to evaluate the nuances of the massacre , to shed light on their own causes
in turn , they would have gained an ally in the @entity21 community
if any of these things would have happened , maybe our discussion would turn to how to take action
how does " freedom " apply to hate speech , gun control , or the history of violence in @entity14 ? maybe @entity203 and @entity204 could unite on the issue of safety in our society
maybe political leaders would realize that when neighborhoods are safer , the economy benefits as more people and businesses move in
maybe immigrants would stand side by side to raise a unified voice in the upcoming elections -- seeking legitimate immigration reform
maybe it 's not too late
maybe these lessons are not lost
maybe those who laid down their lives did not do so in vain
i hope this is the case
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .
