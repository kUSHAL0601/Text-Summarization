-- @entity1 is on a mission to find love , and it 's the kind that has a countdown and can be monitored by any curious voyeur
no , she 's not the newest bachelorette to feed @entity9 's reality tv addiction
the @entity11 media consultant is the brains and heart behind " 52 weeks 2 find him ! " a web site dedicated to the search for her husband
" this whole process has been me really realizing i need to find new ways to be proactive , " said @entity1 , 43 , who might typically get roped into long hours at work or the embrace of a comfortable couch
" i 'm past the stage of believing it 'll just happen
" so she 's putting it all out there on her site
she 's asking friends and strangers to weigh in with advice
she 's pushing herself to do things and act in ways she never has before
and a little more than 14 weeks into the self - imposed challenge , she 's pretty exhausted
" i ca n't believe how hard it is , " she said of the journey so far , which has brought her more dates in two months than she 'd had in two years
" but that 's why the deadline is so important
" setting goals and working hard -- no doubt , it 's the @entity9 way
singles scramble to avoid renewing online dating subscriptions
they sign up for " speed dating " events to feast on a smorgasbord of quick - and - easy first impressions
tv viewers beat up " the bachelor " when he regrets selecting the mate he 's chosen after a limited number of episodes
and how - to books that promise , within a set timeframe , discovery of the one , fly off bookshelves
when it comes to matters of the heart , though , does finding love on a deadline make sense ? " it sounds good from a marketing standpoint , but life does n't work like that , " said @entity67 , " the @entity68 , " who coaches people when it comes to matters of the heart
about five years ago , when she was 27 , @entity67 posted a site called " @entity77 , " with the hope -- albeit somewhat in jest -- that she 'd be engaged within six months
like @entity1 , she felt that setting aside time to focus on her personal life was necessary
" it 's ok to say , ' i want to be a partner in a law firm in three years ' ... but we 're taught to not be open about our desires about marriage , because we do n't want to scare off the guy , " she said
by being honest , " you end up attracting men who want the same thing as you
" a funny thing happened along the way , though
@entity67 found " my one , " as she calls him , ended up living with the guy and felt essentially married
but she walked away when she realized that she had n't taken time to know herself
she was young , caught up in the societal pressures and so worried about finding him that she 'd never bothered to look within
through self - discovery , she fell " totally in love with myself , " she said
" now , i 'm ready for a partner in my life again , but there 's no rush ; there 's no urgency ; there 's no fear
" and nothing is more attractive than a woman who is happy with herself , said @entity110 , a " @entity111 " based in @entity112 , @entity113
he said that putting a deadline on the search for love sounds like " a risky approach " and that allowing time for self - evaluation is most important , no matter the gender
to get where he is , personally and professionally , he had to examine and fix his own mindset when it came to love and romance
" i used to see an ice queen , and i 'd run and impale myself on her cold , bitter heart , " said @entity110 , 35 , who 's engaged to be married next year
" now i have the loveliest , warmest woman i 've ever met
in helping myself , i 've ended up helping other people
" for 23 years , @entity128 has been offering her own brand of assistance by way of an evening course offered at @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135
it was traditionally called " i will be married in one year , " but the psychotherapist has changed the course name in recent years to better represent her curriculum and those she wants to reach , including gays and lesbians who ca n't marry : " @entity143 : the @entity144
" too many people are caught up in the fantasy of how love works and happens , she said
they are prepared to work hard on the job or in school , but they have n't done their homework to achieve true and lasting love
women , for example , think that outward appearances will reel men in , but men do n't give enough attention to how they look , she said
and simple things , like making a conscious effort to smile more often , can make a difference
get advice from matchmakers on what to wear , where to go " women who do n't smile are perceived as hostile
women perceive men who do n't smile as being unsafe , " @entity128 said
" but of course , your best smilers in the world are sociopaths , " she added
though " love does n't have a time limit on it , " @entity128 said giving people time constraints can be important , especially if what they need to do is some of the hard , looking - within kind of work
if people were told to spend five years on this process , they 'd wait until year four to focus , she said
" you have to give people deadlines
" and it 's the deadline of 52 weeks that works for @entity1 , who had never allowed herself this time to focus on her heart and the search for love
this " grand effort , " as she calls it , is simply her attempt to see whether she can add to what is already " a full life " and one that she loves
if she does n't find him by the end of the year , she 's prepared to take a year off to re-evaluate where she is
" at that point , i 'll probably need a year off from dating , " she said with a laugh .
