@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's not every day that a sheriff 's deputy responds to a call on a water buffalo attack , especially in @entity1 , where they simply do n't exist
but in the @entity9 , a man frantically called 911 early friday after the stuffed water buffalo head hanging on his wall fell on top of him as he slept in his living room recliner
the animal head was so heavy he could n't move it , but he was able to reach his nearby cell phone to call for help , according to deputies with the @entity19
" i was just sitting there and watching the news and kabbam , " said @entity20 , 56 , of @entity21 , @entity1
" then it had me pinned , and that really sucked , " he told @entity2
@entity25 's deputies removed the buffalo head so that paramedics could attend to @entity20
" it weighed at least a couple hundred pounds , " said firefighter paramedic @entity28
" it mostly damaged his pride , " said @entity28
" he said to me , what are the odds of this happening ? i said , ' " you were sitting under a buffalo head , so they were probably pretty good
' " @entity20 was taken to nearby @entity39 where he was treated for minor injuries and sent home to rest -- on his recliner on the 911 calls , @entity20 is heard shouting out his address
" i 'm trapped , " he breathlessly tells operators
" i think a f --- --- buffalo fell on me , " he told them
@entity20 , who owns a water filter company in the @entity9 , rents the home from a friend
he says he 's getting rid of the water buffalo head
" i f --- --- got my ass kicked by a buffalo , imagine if it was alive ,
oh my god , " he said
today , he says he 's feeling the after effects of his run in with this long dead animal
" my neck , my shoulder , my back , my face
i feel like i 've been in the ring with @entity67 , " he said
firefighter 's say one of @entity20 ' arms was pinned by the huge head
" he even had a glass of milk sitting on his night stand , and the only thing he could reach was his phone , " said @entity28
alive , water buffalo can weigh up to about 2,500 pounds and grow to about 6 feet tall and about nine feet long
their heads including their horns can be about six feet wide
the gigantic animal is native to south @entity82 , where some still live in the wild , but some are kept in herds all over the world , mostly for meat or cheese production
" this is karma , " said @entity20
" someone shot this thing and now it 's payback , but he got the wrong fella
i did n't shoot him
