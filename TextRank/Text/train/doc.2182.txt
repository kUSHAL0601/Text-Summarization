@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 strides into the former @entity4
some 20,000 people are standing and singing
purple lights softly pulse across the ceiling , and mist floats around two giant screens flashing words to the songs
it 's not a pulpit but a podium
it 's not an altar but a stage
instead a huge globe spins , and two massive bubbling creeks flank the stage
a lighting system softens distant corners of the massive arena and spreads colored light and smoke in strategic spots
somehow , the space that will hold 40,000 - plus on sunday morning does n't feel like a sports arena
in the control room , producers watch multiple camera angles and feeds
smiling broadly , @entity3 bounds up the few stairs to the stage , closes his eyes , lifts his hands and leads a prayer
" @entity41 , i 'm going to start this week off in faith
expecting to have a blessed and a prosperous week
well , @entity41 bless you
give him your very best today
" welcome to sunday morning at @entity45 in @entity0 , @entity1
it 's reportedly the nation 's largest congregation and probably one of the most diverse places in @entity50
one third of these churchgoers are @entity55 , one - third african - american and a quarter white
there are dozens of nationalities
@entity3 will give this sermon twice
he later said he knows immediately which segments to edit together into a sermon that will air on television to millions three weeks later
between services , he is signing his most recent book in the lobby , just past the bookstore that is one of the highest - grossing @entity68 bookstores in @entity50
his wife , @entity69 , is co-pastor of the church and a best - selling author in her own right
in fact , the @entity73 are not paid to be pastors at @entity45 , according to the church , but they live off the considerable proceeds of their books
@entity3 's advance for " it 's your time , " his third book , an instant best - seller , was $ 12 million , according to the church
settled into the pastor 's suite after two sunday services and book signings , @entity3 explains why he is telling people it 's the time to " thrive
" " i tell them that this is not the time to get discouraged or put your life on hold and really to be talked into having a down year , " @entity3 said
" i really believe that fear is contagious , that worry and anxiety ... if you let that get into you long enough , it almost paralyzes you
" " so if you get talked into saying , ' well , i 'm just going to survive this year and make it and not get laid off , ' i believe you draw more negativity in , versus if you get up and say , ' ok , yes , we 're not in denial the economy is terrible , stuff 's not going great , but i believe that @entity41 calls me to be at the right place at the right time ' and you know put your faith out there -- do n't have a survival mentality , believe that you can thrive
" that message is resonating
his publisher , @entity115 , said some 850,000 copies of " it 's your time " are already in print
@entity3 shrugs off criticism from mainstream protestants , evangelicals and others who call @entity123 , more showbiz than theology -- a religious @entity126 , where after the " ride , " the doors open into the gift shop to buy books dvds , calendars and all things @entity3
" i 'm not a debater , " he said , shrugging
he said he 's been called to deliver @entity41 's message to as many people as possible , and @entity41 gave him a unique set of gifts to do so
one of those gifts is the ability to market brand @entity3 across multiple media : podcasts , @entity141 , books , dvds , cds and television
he produced his father 's telecasts for years and stepped into the spotlight after his death
@entity3 's expertise behind the camera has taken his father 's church to a stratospheric level
@entity3 's supporters and associates suggest mainstream @entity68 mistrust of his success may be as much jealousy as theology
" have you been to church in @entity50 recently ? " one aide said
" they put on a funeral
if you put on a funeral every week , eventually people stop coming
" @entity3 's is the largest , but according to @entity170 , there are 1,350 megachurches in the country , and they are spreading , while more traditional @entity68 churches struggle to fill the pews
" what megachurches represent for good or bad is the world that we live in , " said @entity175 , a sociology of religion professor at the @entity176 in @entity177
" i do n't think it is the only form of religion that is going to survive into the future ; i think there is also a very strong place for small intimate worship settings , like house churches and small cell churches
but the megachurch is appealing and attracting people for a reason ; it parallels the experience that we have with rock concerts and sports arenas and the mall
" @entity3 and @entity198 appear profoundly , unfailingly positive
on the screen that recent sunday are these words -- @entity41 plans to prosper you and not harm you
" i do n't believe it 's just money -- money is a part of it -- but prosper is to give you a good life , meaning good relationships , and give you health , " @entity3 said , explaining the " prosper " phrase comes from the @entity203
it 's to " give you a good job and money to pay your bills and do other things , but you know i encourage people to have a prosperous mindset
@entity3 is often characterized , and criticized , for being a " prosperity preacher
" " i do n't like to be called a prosperity minister because i think in most people 's minds that do n't know me they think , ' well , all he talks about is money , ' " @entity3 said , " which i do n't , i talk about being blessed in so many different ways
" yet he does offer advice about finances and he has some experience
@entity3 said @entity45 still has $ 40 million to pay off on $ 100 million he borrowed to convert @entity4 from a basketball arena into a church
in " it 's your time , " he writes , " if you have a burden of heavy debt , you need to announce to that debt , ' it is finished
' look at that house payment
' look at that college loan
' look at those unpaid bills
' " can @entity41 really wipe out your debts ? " it starts ... with the vision that you have to believe that @entity41 can help you to get out of debt to fulfill your dreams , " @entity3 said
" i do n't think anything is going to happen if you do n't believe , so i think that 's where you start
" and what of the @entity254 verse that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven ? or that @entity261 preached his followers to give up all their belongings and follow him ? " years back at least , you know you had to be poor and to show you were holy , " @entity3 said
" you 're supposed to sacrifice everything , and i 'm all for sacrifice and i believe in that , but i also believe that @entity41 wants us to be leaders
he 's put gifts and talents in every person , that they 're supposed to come out to the full
" @entity2 's @entity274 contributed to this report .
