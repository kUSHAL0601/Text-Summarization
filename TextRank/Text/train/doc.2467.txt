@entity0 -- a day after saying homosexuality is not " an equally valid or successful option , " @entity0 gubernatorial candidate @entity2 denied being anti-gay monday but said it was " disgusting " that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade
" i 've been to one ( parade ) in @entity10
i saw the men in their little speedos , gyrating on each other
i think that 's disgusting
and any father who would take his children to such things , is not really thinking of the fatherly responsibilities -- is more interested in politics , " @entity2 told @entity1 at the @entity15 in @entity0
@entity20 , the @entity0 attorney general and @entity2 's @entity23 opponent , shot back later monday : " he 's probably the last person i 'll take advice from ... on how to raise my daughters
" @entity2 drew fire for a remark he made to an @entity29 group on sunday , in which he said he does n't want children " to be brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality is an equally valid or successful option ( compared with heterosexuality ) ... it is n't
" @entity20 criticized his remarks sunday , as did an advocate for gays and lesbians and an organization for gay and lesbian @entity40
@entity2 defended that remark monday , telling both " today " and @entity45 's " @entity44 " that he was referring to the difficult path homosexuals face because of discrimination
" it 's a very , very ugly experience for those who are discriminated against , " he told " today , " adding that he has a nephew who is homosexual and also has homosexuals working for him
" it 's terrible , and it should n't be
society should be more accepting of it
" " when i talk about issues such as this , i talk from my heart , " he told @entity54 , " and i expect that the press will properly interpret my remarks
if they do n't interpret my remarks correctly ... that 's wrong
" " my nephew is a wonderful boy and he 's gay , " he told " @entity44
" " i see the difficulty he suffers with every day with discriminatory people
" @entity2 's nephew , @entity66 , a member of his campaign staff , declined to comment when contacted by @entity1 early monday
asked whether he believes homosexuality is a choice , @entity2 said , " i 've had difficulty with that
my nephew tells me he did n't have that choice , and i believe it 's a very , very difficult life for a young person
i believe that young people should not necessarily be exposed to that without some really , really mature background first so they can learn to deal with it
it 's a very difficult thing , and i sensitize with it totally
" he said his sunday remarks were taken out of context
a prepared version of his remarks , obtained by @entity1 from @entity0 affiliate @entity85 , contained two lines that @entity2 did not deliver
those lines said , " there is nothing to be proud of in being a dysfunctional homosexual
that is not how @entity92 created us
" @entity2 emphasized in a statement sunday night that he did not include those lines when he delivered his remarks , and said monday he had crossed them out from his prepared remarks
" there was a couple lines in there that i deleted and never spoke , purposefully , because i did n't want to , " he told @entity1
it was unclear , however , how the lines got into his prepared statements
@entity2 at first suggested to " today " that the lines were written by members of the @entity106 group he was speaking to , although he later said he was n't sure whether they originated with a group member or one of his staff
he told " @entity44 " he had dictated in general terms his remarks to a staffer who put the lines in his remarks
@entity2 told @entity1 he did n't know who wrote the remarks
" somebody wrote them and gave them to our staff as their suggested position on something , " he said
in his sunday statement , @entity2 said , " apparently a few reporters relied upon suggested remarks distributed by my hosts at the synagogue in @entity128 after my departure , not the actual statement i made
" the written remarks given to reporters were identical to @entity2 's spoken comments other than the two sentences in question
@entity2 on monday denied being homophobic
" i am 100 percent in favor of all gay rights and always have been
i do n't think they should be married , " he told @entity1
he told @entity54 he would recruit homosexuals to serve in key roles in his government if he is elected
@entity2 's monday remarks came the same day @entity0 police announced the arrest of an ninth suspect in a series of brutal , anti-gay hate crimes against four men
the incident in early october involved three victims being held against their will by as many as nine assailants who beat them in a vacant apartment and sodomized two of them , police said
a fourth victim was beaten and robbed in connection with the attacks
" do n't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way , " @entity2 said sunday
" that would be a dastardly lie -- my approach is live and let live
" " i just think my children and your children would be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family , " he said
asked on monday whether the timing of his remark was poor , given the incident , @entity2 said no. " i think my comments were directed at just the confusion that people have had over this issue , " he said
@entity2 also criticized @entity20 for marching in @entity0 's gay pride parade in june
" that 's not the example that we should be showing the children and certainly not in our schools , " he said
asked about @entity2 's comments later monday , @entity20 called them cynical and divisive
" they were reckless in light of recent violence that we 've had , " @entity20 said
" they were divisive , they were the worst cynical politics trying to pit groups against one another
" @entity0 " celebrates our diversity " with festivities such as the @entity197 parade and the gay rights parade , he said
" you 're not going to make it a negative , you 're not going to play one off against another
we wo n't let it happen in @entity0
" on sunday , @entity20 spokesman @entity203 called @entity2 's comments homophobic and said they showed he was " unfit to represent @entity0
" gay rights groups also criticized @entity2 's remarks
" @entity2 's comments would matter if they were coming from a serious political figure
however , they are not , " said @entity210 , chairman of the gay conservative group @entity212 , in an e-mail to @entity1
" they are instead coming from the imploding campaign of a man with the personal baggage of @entity219 and all the electability of @entity221
" the @entity222 of @entity223 also took issue with the candidate
" @entity2 's statements are unfortunate and show he lacks an understanding of what it means to be gay , " said @entity226 , chairman of the group
" i think gay men and women -- my neighbors and your neighbors -- would be much better off and much more successful if they were allowed equal rights and the option of getting married and raising a family
i do n't want @entity0 to be brainwashed into thinking that ignorance is an equally valid and successful option
" but @entity2 's campaign manager , @entity243 , stood by the gubernatorial candidate 's comments on homosexuality
" @entity2 's position on this is exactly equivalent to the @entity248 , " @entity243 told @entity1
" and if @entity20 has a problem with the @entity248 's position on abortion and homosexuality , he needs to take it up with his parish priest
" @entity2 was seen on cell phone video by @entity1 affiliate @entity255 last month seemingly threatening @entity258 statehouse columnist @entity257 , after he was pressed to back up allegations he 'd made that @entity20 had been unfaithful in his marriage
" you send another goon to my daughter 's house , and i 'll take you out , buddy , " @entity2 said , apparently referring to the @entity258 's coverage of a daughter the candidate had out of wedlock
@entity257 shot back : " you gon na take me out ? " " yeah
" " how you gon na do that ? " " watch , " @entity2 said before walking off
@entity2 's campaign issued a statement the next day claiming that the @entity258 sent a photographer to the @entity276 - area house where @entity2 's 10 - year - old daughter lives
on october 5 , a statement on the candidate 's website about his ideas for economic reform in the state said , " i 'm a builder , not a career politician
i may not always say things in the most delicate or diplomatic way , but i will always tell you the truth and the truth is @entity223 is in a death spiral
" @entity1 's @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .
