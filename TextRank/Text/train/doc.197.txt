-- may 16 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity13 , @entity14 : i 'm @entity16 , and today on @entity17 , we 're gon na be talking about something that wo n't happen until november 6th ... of 2012 ! but we start things off down in @entity4
first up : @entity21 @entity22 : officials facing the threat of massive flooding there have opened several gates on the @entity28
a spillway is something that goes over or around a dam
it 's a safety feature
when too much water builds up around the dam , the spillway 's gates can be opened to let some of that water through
this is what the @entity28 looks like normally : gates closed , nothing coming through
but with floodwaters from the @entity44 rushing in , engineers opened up some of the spillway 's gates for the first time in nearly 40 years
that 's what you see here : water barreling through the gate
the @entity28 has 125 total gates
officials plan to open up to one - fourth of those
opening the gates should divert floodwaters away from major cities , like @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity4
but it will send water toward homes and farmland in other parts of the state
people who live there -- many of whom have had to evacuate their homes -- are preparing for devastation
@entity70 , @entity71 , louisiana resident : it 's worse than we thought
it 's really worse than we thought
we thought maybe we might have water in our yard
instead , this is going to come into our home
it 's going to take everything we have got
presidential politics @entity22 : the next @entity84 presidential election is more than 500 days away
might sound like the distant future , but there 's a lot that happens between now and then
and since that process is already underway , we 're going to break some of it down for you today
ultimately , one candidate from each party will face off in the general election
that 's on november 6th , 2012
before that , candidates have to win their party 's nomination
that 's what the primary elections help decide
there are lots of political parties out there
the @entity106 , the @entity107
we 're going to look at the two biggest parties : the @entity109 and @entity110
on the @entity109 side , president @entity111 is an incumbent candidate
he 's running for re-election to the office he already holds
he announced his campaign last month
the @entity110 side has a field of candidates
some of them , like former house speaker @entity120 , @entity84 representative @entity121 , and former @entity123 governor @entity122 , have announced their plans to run for president
others have formed what are called exploratory committees
they have n't officially announced their candidacy , but they 're looking pretty seriously at the possibilities
lot of steps to go through between now and election day
we 'll take you through it as campaign season rolls along
@entity138 @entity139 , @entity14 : today 's first @entity140 goes out to mr. @entity142 's geography students at @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 ! whose slogan is " the toughest job you 'll ever love " ? here we go ! is it the : a ) @entity153 , b ) @entity154 , @entity155 ) @entity152 or @entity156 ) @entity157 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a promotional campaign described the @entity152 as " the toughest job you 'll ever love
" that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity152 at 50 @entity22 : the organization promotes peace and friendship by having @entity84 live and work in developing countries
a simple idea , but one that 's lasted
the @entity152 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year
@entity171 caught up with a new member of the corps as she began her journey
( begin video ) @entity176 , former u.s. president : i have today signed an executive order providing for the establishment of a @entity152
@entity181 , @entity17 anchor : that was march 1961
in the 50 years since president @entity176 launched the @entity152 initiative , more than 200,000 volunteers have served in some 139 countries
twenty - two - year - old @entity187 is now one of them
@entity189 , @entity190 : it 's an exciting thing to be a part of
so many amazing people have been @entity152 volunteers , and just the network of people who have done it
they use the word " family " a lot
it 's exciting to sort of be going into that
@entity202 : @entity187 recently earned her college degree in human biology and african studies
she plans to put it to good use for the next 27 months in @entity208 , where she 'll work in the @entity152 malaria program
@entity210 : professionally , this is going to be sort of the best thing that i can do , in terms of on - the - ground experience and whether i want to work broadly in life or doing policy work
and personally , i think it 's going to be the biggest challenge of my life , being in an entirely new culture
@entity202 : @entity152 volunteers serve in several areas : education , hiv / aids awareness , agriculture , and business development , just to name a few
they are provided with health insurance , a housing allowance , and they receive about $ 7,500 at the end of their 27 - month assignment
and the desire to serve is still very strong
@entity235 , @entity236 , @entity190 : today , we have more @entity152 volunteers in the field than at any time in the last 40 years
and , you know , i think it 's representative that @entity84 are ready to serve
they 're answering president @entity111 's call to service
@entity202 : forty - seven people in this latest group of @entity152 volunteers are heeding that call
@entity249 , @entity190 : i just hope to do stuff , to complete projects that people will appreciate
maybe something that 's sustainable , so when i leave they will have it
@entity256 , @entity257 : two years seems a lot like now , but in the grand scheme of things , it 's really not that big
so , if i can donate a little of my time to try to do some good , i think it 's worth a shot
@entity202 : and for @entity187 , she says she is ready for the learning experience of a lifetime
@entity210 : one of the goals of the @entity152 is to bring a better understanding of @entity84 to other people around the world
and i hope i can , like , be an ambassador for @entity84
and show sort of the good side
@entity202 : @entity171 , @entity17
( @entity276 ) shoutout @entity277 @entity278 , @entity14 : time for a @entity279 ! when did @entity280 become the first @entity281 to play in baseball 's major league ? you know what to do ! was it the : a ) 1930s , b ) 1940s , c ) 1950s or @entity156 ) 1960s ? another three seconds on the clock -- go ! @entity280 made his major league debut in 1947
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity279 ! celebrating civil rights @entity22 : starting with @entity280 , black and white major leaguers played together on the field
but for many years , they could n't go to the same restaurants and hotels off the field
that changed with the @entity302 of the 1960s
saturday , young people got to play and talk with former all - stars as @entity306 honored those who fought for social justice in the game and in the country
the celebration continued yesterday when the @entity311 hosted the @entity312
the teams wore uniforms from 1974
that 's the year that @entity316 hit home run number 715 to break @entity319 's career record
@entity320 talked to " @entity316 " about the influence of the civil rights era
( begin video ) @entity324 , @entity17 anchor : some of them were out there before you
but when you kind of got into the mix , is that something you wanted ? did you ever consider yourself kind of a leader being out front , a leader in the civil rights era ? or did you just want to play baseball ? @entity316 , @entity335 : i wanted to play baseball and i never felt like i was a leader
but i felt like @entity280 had paved the way for , and i wanted to be a baseball player
let me put it that way
and @entity280 had paved the way for all of us
when i say all of them , myself , @entity344 and some of the other black who 's came before him and was a little bit younger than he was , had paved the way
and i felt like it was my responsibility , not only as a baseball player , but to carry myself in such a way that other blacks would be able to look at me and say , " oh , i not only want to be the same kind of ballplayer that @entity316 was , but i want to carry myself off the field the way that he did
" @entity356 : do you ever look back and think , " you know what ? i could have done without it , without the record " ? @entity316 : no , i never did
no. i felt like it was my responsibility
@entity363 had given me the ability to play baseball
i had the world on my shoulders
i knew that i could do most anything i wanted to do out on the baseball field
and i always felt like i was , it may sound kind of silly , but i always felt like i was surrounded by angels on the baseball field
you know , i just felt like there was absolutely nothing that could happen to me
( @entity276 ) before we go @entity22 : before we go , we 've got the scoop on a big story out of @entity379
it 's the world 's largest ice cream cake ! the massive dessert tipped the scales at more than 22,000 pounds
that 's more than 10 tons of ice cream ! engineering students figured out how to build the thing without it melting
talk about a brain freeze
thousands of people showed up for the cake 's debut
thousands of lucky people ; they each got to try some
goodbye @entity22 : must have been sweet to witness a slice of history
we 're gon na chill out for a little bit , but we 'll be back tomorrow with more @entity0
