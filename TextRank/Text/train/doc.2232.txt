-- @entity2 investigators and the @entity3 began combing through a western @entity2 landfill tuesday in search of fresh clues to the june disappearance of college student @entity8
the @entity11 has isolated a roughly 170,000 - cubic - foot patch of garbage at the landfill and may need two weeks to sort through it , the department said in a statement announcing the search
the site holds waste transported from @entity20 , including from bins intersection where the @entity23 student was last seen
" while working with the company that operates the landfill , @entity27 , waste that was taken from the city on and around the dates of @entity32 's disappearance was identified at the landfill site , " police said
" that location within the landfill has remained isolated and secured since that time with no additional waste placed in the identified area
" the landfill is in @entity39 , about 60 miles west of @entity20 and about 10 miles south of @entity40
in a statement issued through police , the @entity32 family offered investigators their " sincere thanks and appreciation for their continued support in our efforts to find @entity49
" @entity32 , a 20 - year - old sophomore , disappeared early june 2 after leaving a @entity20 sports bar with a male acquaintance
police said surveillance video from an alley showed them walking toward his building around 3 a.m. @entity32 's keys were later found in that alley , but the petite blonde never made it home
one of her companion 's neighbors reported seeing @entity32 leave around 4:30 a.m. , but police said they found no sign of her after the 3 a.m. sighting on any of the surveillance video they viewed from the blocks between the two buildings
in a statement posted on their website over the weekend , @entity32 's parents expressed frustration at the " deafening silence " among her friends and acquaintances and pleaded for them to come forward with any information
" there is no reason to think the people @entity49 was last with would n't do everything in their power to help us find her , " they wrote
" the silence compounds our frustration , our desperation and our grief in not having found @entity49 , " they added
" it threatens to be our undoing , but make no mistake , we will never give up
