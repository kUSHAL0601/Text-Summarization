@entity0 -- a @entity3 man accused of orchestrating his wife 's murder by hit men while they were honeymooning in @entity7 has lost a @entity8 appeal to block his extradition there until he is fit to stand trial
the judges ruled that @entity13 can be extradited as long as the @entity7 government pledges to return him to the @entity3 should he ultimately prove unfit to be tried
@entity13 's lawyers had argued that he should not be extradited while he was unfit to stand trial
he is being treated for post traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness
his legal team can appeal the decision at the @entity21
@entity13 is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife , @entity24 , 28 , during a taxi ride in @entity26 in november 2010 , just over two weeks after their wedding
taxi driver @entity28 confessed within weeks of the bride 's death that he had hired two men to kill her
in a plea deal with @entity7 authorities , he said he was paid by @entity13 to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a carjacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of @entity26
@entity28 was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing
proper protection in their ruling , the judges at the @entity8 in @entity0 said there was some prospect that @entity13 could recover sufficiently to be fit to stand trial
it is also possible that the continued uncertainty over his extradition could act to deter his recovery
they also said they were confident in the ability of @entity7 's authorities to treat @entity13 fairly
" the death of the appellant 's wife @entity62 occurred over three years ago , " they said in their conclusions
" the interests of justice , including the interests of her family who like other families of murdered persons wish to see a trial take place as soon as is practicable , require expedition and that there should be no further delay , provided that proper protection is afforded to the appellant in the manner we have set out
" @entity1 's @entity81 contributed to this report .
