-- players in the top two tiers of the @entity4 league have announced they are to go on strike for the first two weekends of the season
over 100 players , including @entity10 captain @entity9 and @entity12 goalkeeper @entity11 , voted for action in a long - running financial dispute with the league ( @entity15 )
@entity4 champions @entity10 are due to begin the defence of their title at @entity19 on august 21 with their nearest challengers , and fierce rivals @entity12 , hosting @entity21
in a statement on their web site the president of the players ' union ( @entity29 ) @entity22 confirmed the strike action would go ahead
the disagreement centers on the union 's demand for an increase to the emergency fund that helps protects players ' wages if their clubs experience financial difficulties
the league said in their own statement that they did not understand the strike action as they had recently introduced two " historic " changes in relation to the players ' requests
a new financial self - regulation code for clubs has been introduced as well as a guarantee to cover a chunk of wages for players at clubs who go into administration
" for this reason , the calling of a strike at a moment when fundamental steps forward are being taken is incomprehensible for the @entity15 , " they said
at a press conference on @entity62 , flanked by @entity9 and @entity11 , attacked the league
as it stands we are at the bottom of the pile in @entity69 , " @entity22 said
" we do n't want more money we want the clubs to honor the contracts they sign with their players
" we have put forward proposals which exist in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 which are preventative
in these countries if a club shows it ca n't pay its players the club does n't compete
" we have asked that players who are owed more than three months ( wages ) can break their contracts
it seemed like we had an agreement but it was left out
" the @entity15 continued in their statement : " the position of the @entity15 is at all times to advance the negotiations , to continue working and to reach early agreement satisfactory to all
