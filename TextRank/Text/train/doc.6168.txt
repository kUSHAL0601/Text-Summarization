@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 military on friday tightened its grip on the politically unstable @entity6 nation , banning more than 150 prominent figures from leaving the country and threatening to arrest politicians who disobey its orders
former prime minister @entity12 was among those who reported to the military junta , which seized power in a coup thursday after months of turmoil that paralyzed much of the government and caused deadly clashes in the streets of @entity0
the @entity22 and other countries have criticized the military 's intervention , the latest in a long list of coups in @entity1 , and called for the swift restoration of democracy
@entity12 , whose government was in power when the unrest began in november , was removed from office this month by the country 's @entity34 over the appointments of top security officials
prominent people summoned @entity12 arrived around noon friday at a military compound in @entity0 with one of her sisters and was still there hours later , a source close to the former leader told @entity2
the military on thursday summoned @entity12 and three other members of her politically powerful family to report to authorities
it has also called on more than 100 others , including prominent figures on both sides of @entity1 's political divide , to come to military facilities
those who do n't report , it has warned , will be arrested
military officials have n't provided much explanation about the reasons for the summonses , saying it 's necessary " to ensure smooth operation of restoration of peace and order
" they have also placed travel bans on @entity12 and scores of others
@entity12 was being detained at a military barracks outside @entity0 , the @entity1 government 's national security adviser , lt. gen. @entity70 , said late friday
@entity70 said @entity12 was detained for her own safety along with and former ministers and one - time members of her @entity75
the junta on thursday detained some of the leaders of the country 's deeply polarized political factions
some of those held , including opposition leader @entity82 and members of @entity12 's @entity84 , were later released
constitution ditched , curfew imposed gen. @entity88 , the head of the military , has assumed the powers to act as prime minister until a new one takes office , the military said thursday
how the government will operate remains unclear , given that the military also has thrown out the constitution it drew up in 2007 after a previous coup , except for @entity99 , which acknowledges that the @entity100 is the head of state
the last six months have been marked by large - scale protests , both by those backing @entity12 's government and those opposed to it
there have been periodic outbursts of deadly violence in the streets
protest camps of both sides in @entity0 have been cleared away since the coup
under the new order , schools will be closed nationwide between friday and sunday , the military said
a curfew is in place between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and all state - run , satellite and cable tv providers have been ordered to carry only the signal of the army 's television channel ; @entity2 is among those networks that have been taken off the air
the military warned against posting misleading or critical comments on social media platforms
in a speech thursday , @entity88 explained that these actions were necessary to restore order and push through reforms
in @entity0 , calm and a cleanup the day after the coup , a peculiar calm had settled on the streets of much of the @entity1 capital , which has been the focal point of political unrest
a few hundred anti-coup protesters gathered in central @entity0 , some cheering and whistling and others holding banners saying " no to coup , " but members of the military kept a distance
a few demonstrators from rival camps argued among themselves , but police tried to calm both sides down
the crowds were thinning out by early friday evening
life in most of the city 's center appeared normal during the day , with shops open and people going to work
in the area by the @entity160 , where anti-government protesters had camped out for months , work had begun to clear up the detritus that had been left behind
dozens of people were dismantling large tents , cleaning and sweeping
trucks and cranes were pulling down the infrastructure the protesters had put up at the camp
the military presence around the city remained subtle , with few soldiers in view , except outside the @entity175 and military sites
" the situation in @entity0 is quite calm at the moment , but obviously we 're all watching very , very closely to see what happens next , " @entity177 , @entity22 ambassador to @entity1 , told @entity2
@entity177 said she would not be attending a briefing friday that the @entity1 military was holding for diplomats but would send someone from the @entity22 embassy
her comments came after @entity22 secretary of state @entity188 said thursday that there was " no justification " for the military coup
the @entity22 @entity186 in @entity0 has updated its guidance for @entity22 traveling to @entity1
it " recommends that @entity22 citizens reconsider any nonessential travel to @entity1 , particularly @entity0 , due to ongoing political and social unrest and restrictions on internal movements , including an indefinite nighttime curfew
" the question many analysts are asking is how the popular " @entity203 " movement , which supports @entity12 and her exiled brother @entity202 , will respond to the coup
the @entity205 , whose support base is in the rural north and northwest of @entity1 , were already angered by @entity12 's ouster this month , a move they viewed as a judicial coup by @entity0 elites
senior red shirt leaders , as well as prominent figures from the @entity217 protesters , were still being held friday by the military , according to @entity70 , the national security adviser to the government
@entity202 , a business tycoon who built a highly successful political movement through populist policies benefiting the rural masses , was deposed as prime minister in a military coup in 2006
in 2010 , when the @entity226 party was out of power , the @entity205 mounted large protests in the heart of @entity0
an ensuing crackdown by security forces resulted in clashes that killed around 90 people
@entity1 martial law : a cheat sheet to get you up to speed soldiers , selfies and a military coup @entity2 's @entity241 and @entity242 reported from @entity0 , and @entity243 reported and wrote from @entity244
@entity2 's @entity242 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .
