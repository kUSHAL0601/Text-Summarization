editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive of the @entity3 , a national nonprofit , nonpartisan membership organization of people with disabilities , their family members and supporters that was founded in 1995
@entity2 says @entity9 's family experience helped drive his commitment to disability rights
( @entity12 ) -- the disability rights movement has lost a giant in our global struggle for equal opportunity , human dignity and self - determination
sen. @entity9 's leadership as a disability champion was part of a broader commitment to civil and human rights
but his accomplishments in the area of disability law and policy may prove to be his greatest and most long - lasting success as a legislator
senator @entity9 's commitment to the cause of disability rights was informed by his experience as the brother of @entity36 , who was born with an intellectual disability ; and the brother of @entity39 , who devoted her life to improving the world 's treatment of people with intellectual disabilities
it was deepened when his son @entity47 had his leg amputated at age 12 after being diagnosed with bone cancer ; and deepened again when his son @entity51 experienced bipolar disorder and substance abuse as an adult
senator @entity9 understood disability as a human issue because he had a front - row seat from which to witness society 's all - too - often callous and bigoted treatment of children and adults with disabilities
in his heart of hearts , senator @entity9 understood that @entity65 was at its best when it expanded opportunities for people with all types of disabilities , for women , for immigrants , for racial and ethnic minorities , for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgendered people , for infants and children and for seniors
he was able to couple this understanding and commitment with a knack for finding @entity84 and moderate @entity83 partners and working out legislation that could pass with enormous bipartisan support
when the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) passed in 1990 , the vote in the @entity88 was 91 - 6
that vote was the product of hours of cajoling and negotiating between senator @entity9 , his @entity93 allies @entity91 and @entity94 , the @entity96 @entity95 , senators @entity97 and @entity98 , and others
the @entity89 was a once - in - a - lifetime piece of civil rights legislation
thanks to the @entity89 , the @entity65 demonstrated to the world that it was possible to mandate that buses , telecommunications , buildings and schools be accessible
our country showed the world that it is possible to outlaw discrimination in employment against people with disabilities without harming businesses
the example of the @entity89 helped more than 70 foreign countries pass similar legislation , and laid the foundation for the @entity122 , which is driving even more change globally as the 65 countries who have signed and ratified the convention seek to pass implementing legislation
senator @entity9 's legacy extends from the @entity89 to so many other critical bills : the @entity130 , the @entity131 of 1988 , which added disability to the group of protected classes under that critical law ; the @entity136 , which outlaws discrimination and guarantees a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities ; the @entity140 , which gives parents of disabled children the ability to purchase @entity145 coverage for their children even if they were not low - income ; the @entity148 , which requires every polling place to have a machine where disabled people could vote privately and independently ; and the more recent @entity152 and mental health parity legislation
as an attorney with bipolar disorder who graduated from law school in 1990 , i am one of a generation of professionals who have developed our careers in the wake of the @entity89 and other critical laws that protect our right to equal opportunity and fairness
i have personally benefited from senator @entity9 's leadership
i have had the privilege of working closely with his extraordinary sons @entity47 and @entity51 and with his top notch staff
i can not imagine a more effective champion for disability rights , for civil rights , for health care , for basic human decency , than @entity9
his legacy will be felt by more than 600 million children and adults with disabilities around the world for generations to come
we have lost a champion , and we must all work harder to continue to make progress toward his compelling vision of a world where all people have value , all people have dignity , and all people can participate as equals in the lives of their communities
