@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 said friday protesters who resorted to violence thursday night will " feel the full force of the law , " and blamed them for wreaking havoc in @entity0 during the pre-christmas weeks
addressing reporters , @entity2 defended the government 's contentious move to triple tuiton at @entity3 universities and said protesters , not the police , should be blamed for last night 's chaos on @entity18 and nearby areas and for attacking a car transporting prince @entity21 and @entity22
" i immediately rang the @entity21 , " said @entity2 , a reference to prince @entity21
" we need to learn the lesson of this incident , " he said
on friday , police sifted through rubble strewn over @entity0 's @entity29 , searching for clues and culprits in thursday night 's protests , where students , enraged by the triple tuition hike , broke windows and ambushed the royal vehicle
" it is not the fault of the police , " said @entity2
" it was the fault of those who tried to smash that car
" members of the @entity44 said in its website the group condemns any forms of violence , including from the police
" regarding many of the scenes that were witnessed yesterday , whilst it is clear that there were a small number of people involved who were inciting violence , many people were contained for a long period of time when attempting to take part in peaceful protest , " the @entity44 stated
" we are calling on the @entity64 to have a full investigation into the clashes yesterday between protesters and the police and for it to look again at its tactics for policing demonstrations , " it said
a photo of the royal couple , dressed in evening wear , made headlines as it showed the startled expressions on their faces as they sat in their @entity76 before exiting for a @entity77
the royal couple escaped unhurt
police said the route had been cleared minutes before the royal couple was due to make their journey
the high - profile incident came late in a day of violent protests that left at least 12 officers and 43 demonstrators hurt
@entity0 's @entity64 issued a statement friday condemning the protests and alleged vandalism that took place thursday night , claiming protesters intimidated @entity93 shoppers and bystanders
" this has nothing to do with peaceful protest , " the statement said
" students are involved in wanton vandalism including smashing windows in @entity101 and @entity103 streets
" so far , 34 people have been arrested in connection with the protests , and more than 40 protesters have been hospitalized , police said
the protests followed a vote in the @entity111 to approve a plan to raise the existing cap on tuition rates charged by universities from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000 a year
in @entity117 dollars , that 's a nearly $ 10,000 a year increase -- from roughly $ 4,700 to $ 14,000
lawmakers approved the plan in a 323 - 302 vote
the measure awaits approval by the @entity123 and a signature by the queen before it can become law
the vote ended hours of debate inside @entity129
thousands of demonstrators outside said the plan will price many students out of a university education
supporters say the tuition cap hike is needed to cut the government 's massive deficit .
