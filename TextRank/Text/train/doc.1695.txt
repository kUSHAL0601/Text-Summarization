-- while there has been much discussion about the heartburn the new @entity5 rule on carbon emissions is causing @entity7 in this year 's midterms -- especially those from energy producing states -- the person who should be most troubled about the president 's decision is @entity14
the administration 's new coal rule could singlehandedly give the @entity18 nominee in 2016 a path to victory in an @entity21 that has been getting more and more difficult for the @entity18
states that have trended @entity7 can flip back red
@entity24 , the @entity18 has certainly missed your 18 @entity21 votes
@entity27 ( 20 votes ) and @entity29 ( 16 votes ) had all but turned blue , but with higher utility bills coming to voters before 2016 , both are right back in play for the @entity18
win two of those three states and the @entity18 wins the @entity37
@entity39 's 13 electoral votes just got a lot more winnable , too
there is a reason the president did not act so aggressively on his environmental agenda until after his re-election
it would have doomed his campaign
his political advisers responsible for his re-election would have never allowed it
the political folks are gone now and the president does not have to think about things in a political context anymore ; he gets to think about himself and the history books
but what 's a legacy issue for @entity57 may not be a good thing for @entity14
to achieve the president 's goal of a 30 % emissions reduction will cost money , a lot of money
much of the money will come from working families paying higher utility bills in an already difficult economy
jobs will also be lost as businesses grapple with higher energy costs
the @entity5 itself estimates electricity costs will increase up to 7 % by 2020 , critics say it will be far higher
the critics will be right on this one
in 2014 , the debate for @entity78 candidates will be about the prospect of higher utility bills
in 2016 , the debate will be about actual higher utility bills
it will be interesting to see the first presidential poll in @entity83 after utility bills spike
if i 'm a @entity87 adviser , it is already giving me nightmares
when voter 's utility bills go up , they get mad
just ask the @entity92 in @entity93
they got decimated last year for passing a carbon tax
just five days before @entity97 in 2010 , @entity92 prime minister @entity96 vowed at the @entity98 , " there will be no carbon tax under the government i lead
" that promise was not kept and a carbon tax went into effect in 2012
as a result of the carbon tax , @entity93 utility bills went up over $ 500 per household a year
public opinion turned on a dime
@entity96 was removed from the 2013 ballot by her own party before a sure defeat and was replaced by former prime minister @entity112
now , on behalf of his legacy and place in history , president @entity57 and his @entity5 are going to make things difficult for the left in @entity120 in 2014 and beyond
and all @entity14 can do about the @entity5 rule that is creating an electoral minefield for her 2016 bid is applaud
@entity87 can not be critical of the @entity5 rule or she could risk alienating her base and losing a second nomination fight
the environmentalists are a powerful force in @entity7 primary politics , especially on the money side
the 2016 presidential campaign just got a lot more interesting
@entity29 and @entity27 , welcome back to presidential politics , you are now again swing states
the path to 270 electoral votes for the @entity18 nominee just got a lot easier
and president @entity57 may have just denied @entity14 the @entity37 , for a second time
join us on @entity142 / @entity141 .
