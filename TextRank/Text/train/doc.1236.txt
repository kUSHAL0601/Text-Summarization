@entity0 -- it 's coming next week
it 'll protect 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation
there 's still a lot of uncertainty about president @entity10 's upcoming immigration executive order , since @entity10 himself has yet to make a final decision on an action to fix the broken system
but while details are n't yet locked down , there are a few things we know for certain : the move is coming before year 's end , the fate of millions of immigrants are at stake , and @entity24 are fuming
here 's what else you should know about the upcoming immigration order : what is @entity10 going to do ? the biggest question -- one the @entity31 is n't ready to answer quite yet -- is what changes @entity10 will bring to the immigration system to make it fairer
he vowed to take action on his own earlier this year , saying @entity37 had failed to pass any meaningful reforms themselves
administration officials , however , have laid out the contours of a plan : many parents of @entity45 citizens , who are undocumented immigrants themselves , will be allowed to stay and work in the @entity45 legally
an estimate from the @entity47 puts the number of undocumented parents who might be eligible -- since they 've been in the @entity45 for 5 years -- at 3.3 million
related : the immigration waiting game will end soon other potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the @entity45 as children
@entity10 enacted a rule in 2012 permitting some of those children to avoid deportation , but there were age restrictions
changing them could bring hundreds of thousands more into the fold
officials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology
lastly , the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border
what will that actually do for immigrants ? immigration activists have long called for a fix to the system that would end deportations splitting up families
thanks to the 14th amendment to the @entity84 , anyone born in the @entity45 is automatically a citizen - that includes children whose parents are undocumented immigrants
but this also means many immigrant families find themselves in positions where one or both parents face deportation , while their children are allowed to stay
permitting those parents in the @entity45 to work legally and avoid deportation would allow families to remain together
president @entity10 has said keeping families together would be part of the reason he 'll acting alone to provide relief from the threat of deportation
how many people would be affected by the move remains to be determined , since the details are n't yet finalized
if @entity10 announces he 'll allow all undocumented parents of @entity45 citizens , legal permanent residents , or deferred - deportation - eligible kids , 3.7 million people could be affected , according to the @entity47 's report
but a stricter policy could bring those numbers down
mandating parents live in the @entity45 for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.4 million ; a 10 - year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.6 million people
will it be enough ? even under the broadest interpretation , @entity10 is expected to provide relief to 5 million undocumented immigrants
that 's fewer than half the 11.7 million currently thought to be in the @entity45
his action would be far less sweeping than a comprehensive bill passed through @entity37
it would also be temporary
the next president could simply undo the orders and re-start deportations
but with @entity37 unlikely to pass a comprehensive bill , @entity10 's action may be the best activists can hope for
immigration rights groups have been waiting a long time for @entity10 to pull the trigger on his immigration action
first announced this spring , the @entity31 initially said the actions would be in place by the end of the summer
politics got in the way when @entity10 pushed the announcement until after this month 's midterm elections
now activists say anticipation is high with the waiting game nearing an end
but their expectations for @entity10 's final plan are n't exactly sky high
" our expectations are n't tempered
but we fear that @entity10 's may be , " said @entity152 , deputy vice president of the @entity153
@entity154 , the advocacy director at immigrants ' rights group @entity155 , said she expected the eventual announcement to fall somewhere short of the maximum @entity10 could do with his executive power
" i think they will try to couch that as ' these are our political constraints , ' " she said
what will @entity24 do if @entity10 offers relief to many undocumented immigrants ? impeachment ? as soon as @entity10 announced he was taking unilateral action on immigration , @entity24 denounced him as overstepping his constitutional bounds
those cries of overreach do n't show signs of quieting as the announcement nears
on the extreme end are calls for impeachment , which were fueled this week when rep. @entity175 , a @entity24 from @entity176 , said @entity10 's moves could spark proceedings in the @entity31
@entity179 , a conservative columnist , said thursday night the potential actions are " an impeachable offense
" related : immigration action would spur calls for impeachment it 's hard to say exactly how @entity24 will react since the action has n't been announced in any detail
but no matter what @entity10 does it 's certain to spark @entity24 outrage
house speaker @entity190 said @entity10 was playing with matches and " would get burned " if he went ahead with executive action
soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity193 said the president would " poison the well " in terms of working with @entity24 for the final two years of his presidency
the lawsuit against @entity10 that @entity31 @entity24 have threatened could be expanded to include the immigration order
and any funding required for the plan could be held up in @entity37
all that only seems to empower @entity203 , who say the threats demonstrate how resistant the @entity24 is to changing the broken immigration system
will it all cause a government shutdown ? it all comes down to timing
as @entity10 prepares to unveil the long - awaited immigration action , lawmakers in the congressional lame duck are wading through some important business , chiefly passing a measure that would fund the federal government
if the immigration announcement comes before the spending bill is passed , @entity24 could hold it up
with funds running out in mid-december , that could trigger another government shutdown
to avoid that , @entity24 could pass a short - term spending measure the keeps the government running while they determine their next steps
but even some democrats do n't want to take chances -- sen. @entity230 , the outgoing @entity193 , said he wanted @entity10 to wait until after the spending bill passes to make the immigration announcement
the @entity31 , meanwhile , has n't given any hints on when the announcement will come , saying the decision wo n't be made until @entity10 returns from his trip to @entity237 this weekend
