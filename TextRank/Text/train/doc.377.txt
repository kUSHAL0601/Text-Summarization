@entity0 -- it has happened before : @entity3
@entity6 but , this time , the @entity7 and a growing number of @entity10 lawmakers on @entity11 promise it will be different
this time , they say , things will change
in @entity0 and around the country , the legacy left by the 26 people -- 20 of them young children -- slaughtered in a school shooting on friday in @entity17 , @entity18 , might indeed be meaningful legislative reform
over the past few days , several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation , ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high - capacity magazines
on monday , there was a moment of silence on the floor of the @entity32 to honor those killed at @entity34
the chamber 's chaplain called on lawmakers to " act promptly
" the @entity7 also observed a moment of silence monday evening
latest updates out of @entity17 , @entity18 " to me and to others , this one feels different , " said @entity40 , co-director of the @entity41
" maybe because of the timing , maybe because of the victims , 20 young children
maybe it 's because we have a president who has been re-elected who is not going to be running again
that does n't mean those political obstacles are n't still there , but it does feel different
" friday , just after the shooting , @entity7 spokesman @entity54 said president @entity56 was willing to consider reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004
on sunday , in his remarks at the vigil in @entity17 , @entity56 hinted that he 'll " use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens ... in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this
because what choice do we have ? " on monday , the @entity7 inched closer to addressing what @entity54 called a complex problem
and tuesday afternoon , @entity54 said the president now supports sen. @entity71 's intended effort to reinstate the assault weapons ban
will @entity17 change @entity74 's attitude toward guns ? pro-gun democrats the most notable shift in tone comes from some conservative democrats who have high rankings from the @entity82 for their pro-gun rights legislative stances
friday 's shooting was a " game changer , " tweeted @entity88 @entity10 sen. @entity87 , who 'd previously received an " a " rating from the @entity82
" this awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us , and everything should be on the table , " sen. @entity90 , a conservative @entity91 from @entity88 and " proud gun owner , " said monday in a statement
" we need to move beyond dialogue -- we need to take a sensible , reasonable approach to the issue of mass violence
" @entity105 @entity104 sen. @entity104 plans to reintroduce legislation in the next @entity107 that would prohibit the sale of high - capacity magazines , his office confirmed monday
he and @entity112 sen. @entity71 hail from states that advocates of gun control , such as the @entity116 , say have some of the toughest gun restrictions
@entity71 announced sunday she 'll reintroduce an assault weapons ban when @entity107 reconvenes in january
movement in the @entity7 citizen - created petitions on the @entity7 's website have netted thousands of signatures on both sides of the issue in just a few days
but the political reality is that crafting meaningful legislation is a tricky prospect
the @entity7 has said @entity56 supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons -- a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term
" it does remain a commitment of his , " @entity54 told reporters friday
but later that day , an emotional @entity56 did not address the issue directly in a televised statement from the @entity7
" we 're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this , regardless of the politics , " said @entity56 , the father of two girls
a @entity7 source told @entity1 that on monday afternoon , @entity56 had discussions with @entity7 senior staff , the vice president and several @entity149 members , including education secretary @entity150 , @entity152 secretary @entity151 and attorney general @entity153 to begin looking at ways the country can respond to the tragedy in @entity17
the politics of guns @entity56 largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term
he wrote an opinion piece two months after the 2011 assassination attempt on rep. @entity164 of @entity165 , acknowledging the importance of the @entity168 right to bear arms and called for a focus on " effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible , law - breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place
" @entity177 sentenced to life in deadly @entity165 shootings but in the aftermath of that shooting and as the election season loomed , the @entity180 backed off from a list of recommendations that included measure designed to help keep mentally ill people from getting guns
there are also other political considerations
while @entity10 lawmakers took to the airwaves this weekend to call for congressional action on gun control , the few @entity191 who did speak out pointed to numerous court cases that have upheld @entity168 rights and said guns are needed as mechanisms for self - defense
and others have said the solution is more guns in schools , not fewer
@entity206 @entity205 rep. @entity205 said on " @entity207 " that if school principal @entity34 had an assault rifle in her office , she could have killed the shooter
" i wish to @entity213 she had an m - 4 in her office locked up -- so when she heard gunfire , she pulls it out and she did n't have to lunge heroically with nothing in her hands , " @entity205 said
" but she takes him out , takes his head off , before he can kill those precious kids
" @entity82 big supporter of politicians protecting those @entity168 rights has also included hefty campaign donations
during the 2012 election cycle , the @entity82 donated $ 719,596 to candidates
republicans received $ 634,146 of that , according to the @entity229 ' analysis of federal campaign data
for example , @entity7 majority leader @entity231 , @entity232 , ranked among the top five recipients , having received $ 7,450 in this cycle
some $ 85,450 went to @entity10 , many of them in states that are considered more conservative when it comes to gun control laws
for example , @entity10 rep. @entity240 got $ 6,950 this cycle and represents a district in @entity244 , a state gun control policy advocates say has some of the nation 's weakest gun laws
a number of @entity10 lawmakers who hail from conservative states are up for re-election in 2014 , which may also increase the pressure not to touch the gun issue
analysis : guns and the law gun policies are " still a third rail especially if you 're really going to try and do something about it , " said @entity262 , dean and professor at the @entity264 at @entity266 's @entity265
" there are a lot of issues there
" according to a new @entity274 / @entity273 survey on gun control conducted over the weekend , 52 % of people see the mass shootings as a sign of broader problems in society
this up from 24 % in august shortly after the deadly theater shooting in @entity3 , @entity281
the poll also found rise in people who strongly favor stricter gun control , 44 % , and a double - digit gap between them and the 32 % who say they strongly oppose stricter gun control laws
in august , 39 % supported tougher laws and 37 % opposed them
a @entity291 poll conducted after the @entity164 shooting found that 49 % of @entity74 said it was " more important to protect the rights of @entity74 to own guns , " while 46 % said it was " more important to control gun ownership
" but a survey conducted by @entity1 / @entity299 in august shortly after the @entity3 incident found that 76 % of those surveyed believe " there should be some restrictions on owning guns
" and as debate is sure to ensue in @entity0 , so it has already online
" you can make as many laws as you want it will not change people who want to hurt others
we all need to arm our self now
that is the only way , " reader @entity312 commented on @entity1
which prompted another reader to reply : " that worked so well for the shooter 's mother , did n't it ? " view from abroad : sorrow , but little hope for @entity74 gun control @entity1 's @entity323 and @entity324 contributed to this report .
