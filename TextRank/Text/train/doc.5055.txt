@entity0 -- a @entity3 prosecutor told the court she intends to seek the death penalty in a case where a 10 - year - old girl was found dead in the back of her father 's truck
@entity11 and @entity12 , the adopted parents of the girl , @entity12 , have been charged with first - degree murder
in @entity3 , the prosecution must file a notice at the beginning of the legal proceedings if it plans to seek the death penalty
if that 's not done , the state waives the right to seek that sentence later in the case
monday 's first appearance on the charges is just the beginning of the @entity30 ' criminal case
as it continues , the prosecutors will make it clear whether the death penalty will be sought
the @entity30 have also been charged with eight counts of aggravated child abuse and eight counts of child neglect
@entity12 is charged with an additional count of mutilation or abuse of a dead body
they pleaded not guilty on monday
in court , the couple sat apart from each other but next to their individual attorneys
@entity12 was wearing a bulletproof vest that showed his bare arms , and @entity12 was in a bright orange jail - issued outfit
over the years the couple has been at the center of multiple complaints to @entity3 's @entity55 , with callers reporting that @entity57 and her twin brother were locked in bathrooms for long periods of time or bound with tape , according to testimony given in family court
nevertheless , the children remained in the @entity67 home
this case prompted an independent review of the @entity55
the panel recently released " the @entity71 , " recommending changes the agency should make in training and technology
the report says when a call is made to the abuse hotline , " @entity55 should work with law enforcement to ensure an appropriate joint response when children are not located quickly
" that change is a result of a phone call to the abuse hotline four days before @entity57 's body was found in her father 's truck
the call was made by a therapist , saying that the granddaughter of @entity12 told her that the twins were being abused , according to documents released in the case
a @entity55 investigator went to the house but did not see the children and did not notify the police
the pest control truck that @entity12 was driving was found by a road ranger on the side of @entity102 in the @entity104 area on february 14
firefighters called to the scene found @entity12 and @entity57 's brother suffering from burns and a chemical - related illness , said @entity111 spokesman @entity110
hazardous material teams were called in to investigate fumes coming from the vehicle
" the department of environmental protection went into the rear of the vehicle , moving aside some chemicals and located a body in a bag in the rear of the vehicle , " said @entity110
the body has since been identified by the @entity104 medical examiner as that of @entity12
@entity12 did speak to police after he was arrested , according to a probable cause affidavit for the aggravated child abuse charges
the document says that @entity12 told police that he drove to @entity104 that day " after he placed his deceased daughter in a plastic bag , which he loaded in the rear of his truck
" when @entity12 and his son were released from the hospital , the father went to jail and the child went to a therapeutic foster home
jail is where both @entity12 and @entity12 will be staying , since they were denied bond , awaiting a resolution of their case .
