-- @entity1 knows a thing or two about upsetting the odds
the 29 - year - old @entity5 sprinter has had to overcome grinding poverty to become one of the greatest olympians her country has ever produced
after being spotted running barefoot at a school sports day , @entity1 burst on to the track and field scene when she won silver as part of @entity5 's 4x100 meters sprint team at the @entity15
that was just the start
she went on to win gold in the 200 meters at both the @entity20 and 2008 @entity21
now she faces her toughest test at her fourth games
@entity0 photos : on the fringe of an @entity27 dream if she emerges triumphant at @entity30 's @entity29 in august , she will be the first person in history to win three consecutive gold medals in the distance
she is in good form too
last year she ran the 100 meters in 10.76 seconds , the second quickest time in history
@entity0 's human to @entity37 caught up with the @entity39 - born sprinter -- who hails from the same @entity5 parish that has given the world champion men 's sprinter @entity41 -- to talk about @entity44 , her rivals and why a third gold would be the icing on the cake
growing up in poverty " i have five brothers , four sisters , so you can just imagine the competition in the house
it helped me be very competitive , strong and independent , " @entity1 said
" i used to race the boys and win
so i knew i had a special gift and should work on improving it
" when i was very young in primary school , we had a lot of sports days
i won the double there running barefoot
my coach and teacher said , ' you 're very talented
' he recommended a high school , the ' @entity69 ' ( @entity70 )
from that moment i came to the realization he was telling the truth
" are yams the secret of @entity39 's success ? @entity1 's birthplace has produced many top runners , including triple @entity27 champion @entity41 , @entity82 athlete @entity81 and disgraced @entity84 sprinter @entity83
" there 's a lot of sprinters that come from @entity39 , it 's so different , the country air
when i was growing up i did n't have central heating
i 'd have to go and collect water from the river
i used to do a lot of walking , " @entity1 said
" i think it 's just hard work and determination
@entity5 is full of so many talents
my parents were farmers and used to plant their own yams that are starchy high in carbs
we took it right from the ground
" life after winning gold in @entity107 " i felt blessed
i do n't think anything i 've achieved has changed me
i am the same person
my personality does n't change
you have to believe it to achieve it ... i visualized it and made it happen
" on giving back @entity1 has a charitable foundation aimed at empowering @entity5 girls through sport
" i believe in giving back
when i was younger so many people helped me to become the woman i am today
so i feel , because i am in the position to help someone , i need to do it , " she said
" if i can touch just one life i will help someone , to try and help females in @entity5 to get a high school education , mentor them and make sure they keep a level head and point them in the right direction
" history beckons at @entity44 ? as well as seeking a record third consecutive 200m gold , @entity1 is also trying to qualify for the 100m , in which she was world champion in 2007 and runner - up in 2005 and 2011
" there are a lot of great , talented women out there , hungry to perform at their best for the @entity27
there can only be one winner
it will be quite interesting
everyone will have a great time watching it , " she said
" the @entity27 are the highlight , the most recognized event in track and field
everybody waits for the @entity27
it 's very important to me
i 'll be going for a fourth time
" i 've never won the 100 meters at the @entity27
if i win the 200 meters for a third time i will be the first woman to achieve that in history
" " it feels good
when i was a little girl my dream was always to get an individual gold medal
i have two , which is more than i asked for
a third will be the icing on the cake
