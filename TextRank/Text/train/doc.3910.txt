@entity1 , @entity0 -- an @entity4 professor doing research in @entity1 stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by , to , and about @entity8 , a stunning find that sheds new light on early @entity4 history
the letters cover @entity8 's success in dealing with a @entity15 general
the collection of 47 letters are hand - written copies made 250 years ago , when @entity8 lived in @entity1
that they were filed under the copyist 's name , not @entity8 's , may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now , said a curator at the @entity25 , where the letters are held
the find is reported in the april issue of the @entity29 , a journal of early @entity4 history and culture
the letters are important in large part because they offer a " wealth of new details " that affect modern understanding of @entity39 , writes @entity40 , the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007
they also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on @entity39 and his life
@entity47 , a professor at the @entity49 , discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to @entity1 , just before the library 's closing time
" the first item was a letter from @entity8 to the secretary of the governor of @entity58 , and i looked at it and i started to read , and i thought , ' this does n't look familiar , ' " @entity40 told @entity2
" i 've read everything @entity8 ever wrote
" @entity40 said he quickly began to realize he had uncovered something previously unknown to historians
" i swear , i just about shot through the ceiling i was so excited , " he said
" it 's like finding a treasure chest
" @entity47 had been working at the time on a book on @entity39 , " @entity8 and the @entity68 , " published last year
the letters cover @entity8 's success in dealing with @entity15 gen. @entity71 , who had been sent to @entity72 in 1755 to defeat the @entity73 at @entity74 , in modern - day @entity75
the march to retake the fort was part of the @entity73 and @entity15 battle for control of the western lands in the colonies , part of a larger struggle for control of @entity87 , @entity40 said
the problem was that @entity71 was given no horses or wagons when he arrived in @entity87 -- no means of transport for him and his 2,000 redcoats
@entity71 started to blame his hosts , so @entity8 -- the @entity72 assembly 's leading politician -- stepped in to help
@entity8 went all over @entity72 trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to @entity71 and his men
it was n't easy , because the farmers were tough negotiators who were also anxious and suspicious of the effort
eventually , @entity8 managed to get the farmers to agree , and within weeks , @entity71 and his men were on the march
@entity71 suffered a devastating defeat before he even reached the fort , however , when a much smaller contingent of @entity73 and @entity109 soldiers surprised the @entity15
they killed @entity71 and about 1,000 of his men
despite the defeat , @entity8 's success -- in what became known as " the wagon affair " -- highlighted his skill as a colonial leader , @entity40 said
when @entity8 was sent to @entity1 in 1757 as a representative of the assembly , he brought with him a collection of letters detailing that success
it was proof of his political value to @entity125 and that the assembly 's loyalties had been on the right side
this collection of letters , which @entity8 referred to in his autobiography as his " quire book , " was never found , however -- until now
@entity40 said he believes the documents he read at the @entity25 are copies of that collection
they were made by @entity136 , an industrious and obsessive transcriber of historical documents who copied anything he could get his hands on
" there was a vogue
it was very common for letters to be copied , " said @entity144 , curator of the @entity4 collections at the @entity25
" @entity136 was very well known for being a copyist
" @entity136 and @entity8 were friends in @entity1 , both members of the @entity150 , and @entity40 said he believes the copies were made sometime between 1757 and 1758
" @entity136 undoubtedly found @entity8 's quire book captivating , and he appears to have copied anything that remotely interested him , " @entity40 writes in the journal
also , @entity71 's campaign and defeat were widely discussed in @entity1 , and " @entity136 may have wanted to capture a crucial moment in the life of the ( @entity162 ) society 's most famous @entity4 member
" @entity136 's transcripts were filed in the @entity25 as " @entity164 relating to the march of @entity165
" they form part of the massive @entity168 containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that @entity136 bequeathed to the library on his death , said @entity144
they were n't properly catalogued until the early 1970s , @entity144 said , which is largely why they have n't been used by scholars
" it 's the first time they 've really been shared with a wider audience , " @entity144 told @entity2
" we 're very pleased
