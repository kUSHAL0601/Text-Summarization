president @entity0 canceled a campaign trip at the last minute to stay in @entity2 and spearhead a more aggressive national response after @entity4 infected two nurses and frightened @entity6 with the prospect that their health system is not equipped to handle a catastrophic medical event
@entity0 said wednesday that monitoring of @entity4 must be done in a " much more aggressive way
" he continued , according to the pool report , to say that as soon as someone is diagnosed , the @entity12 must have a rapid response team immediately on site
the @entity18 is taking this very seriously at the highest levels
the president made the comments after a special meeting of his cabinet that was convened to address @entity4 and came as one of the infected nurses in @entity27 was transported to special hospital facilities in @entity29 for care
get up to speed on @entity4 developments @entity0 said the @entity12 would deploy new @entity34 teams within 24 hours to any hospital with an infected patient
he also promised that the federal government would review contacts made by infected people before they showed symptoms
but he urged calm , repeating that @entity4 is not easily spread if someone is not showing symptoms
" here 's what we know about @entity4
it 's not like the flu
it 's not airborne , " the president said , adding that he had met , hugged and even kissed health care workers at @entity50 in @entity51 who had treated @entity4 patients
the @entity18 announced wednesday that it was postponing @entity0 's campaign trip -- which included stops in @entity57 and @entity58 -- in order for the president to meet with " @entity24 agencies coordinating the government 's response to the @entity4 outbreak
" with the potency of his last years in office on the line , @entity0 was expected to cautiously step back on to the campaign trail wednesday , rallying @entity68 in dyed - blue @entity57 working to keep the governor there in office
but the president still will continue to mostly avoid campaigning in @entity73 contests , sticking to the gubernatorial campaign trail in three visits over the next week and four more planned trips in the final week of the 2014 season
only one of those trips -- in @entity80 -- is set to involve @entity82 's @entity73 nominee
vulnerable candidates in places such as @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 have been loathe to invite @entity0 to rally for them in their own states , spooked by his low approval ratings and the unpopular policy initiatives they helped move through @entity92
that 's left @entity0 relegated to the role of chief fund - raiser , jetting to wealthy enclaves across the country to try and keep donors encouraged enough about @entity68 ' chances to keep writing checks
it 's been a tough sell recently , with republicans almost certain to retain control of the @entity105 and models giving the @entity107 an edge to take the @entity73
@entity18 : no @entity110 replacement until after midterms in @entity57 , where @entity0 had been scheduled to speak wednesday , gov. @entity112 is tied with @entity107 rival @entity113 , who served as the @entity6 ambassador to @entity115 from 2006 - 2009
a @entity118 / @entity117 poll had both men at 41 % among likely voters in a survey taken the last week of september
a @entity18 official had said earlier @entity0 would also campaign with two @entity68 gubernatorial candidates on sunday : @entity124 in @entity125 and @entity126 in @entity127
both have slight edges over their @entity107 rivals , and will depend on high turnout among african - americans , one group with which @entity0 still has sway
@entity0 's midterm malaise @entity57 and @entity125 are both deep blue , swinging in @entity0 's direction by wide margins in both 2008 and 2012
in @entity57 , voters have been more willing to send @entity107 to the @entity140 -- when @entity141 took office in 2011 he succeeded two @entity107 governors
and @entity0 will use the final week of the campaign season crisscrossing the country to boost gubernatorial candidates in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity80
@entity18 aims to show @entity0 at work in states with tight @entity73 races that are either @entity107 - leaning or true battlegrounds , @entity68 have gone to sometimes extreme lengths to avoid @entity0 's drag
@entity157 , challenging senate minority leader @entity156 in @entity85 , would n't even say whether she voted for @entity0 in the last election
the @entity18 , while defending @entity0 's economic record , says issues such as @entity4 and combating @entity161 have occupied the bulk of his time
but they say he 'll do what he can for @entity68 ahead of november 4
" the president obviously has got a few things on his plate these days , but ( he ) is looking forward to the opportunity to campaign with other candidates in advance of the midterms , " press secretary @entity166 said tuesday .
