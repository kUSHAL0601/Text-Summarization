@entity1 , @entity0 -- he is hailed as a god in his native @entity5 , has been a vital part of the country 's culture since the mid- 70s and is largely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time
@entity13 's crowning achievement was captaining @entity5 to @entity15 glory in 1986
now , 11 years since retiring from playing , @entity13 is making a triumphant return to the sport as the @entity19 national coach
however , his checkered past has made @entity13 something of a surprise choice
the 48 - year - old has regularly courted controversy -- not with - standing his well - publicized drug - addiction
his talent has never been in doubt , though , and his performances on a domestic and world stage are the stuff of legend
since beginning his career as a 15 - year - old with @entity34 , @entity13 has attracted legions of fans
at club level , @entity13 won the @entity19 title with @entity39 , prompting a high - profile move to @entity42 football , where he won the @entity43 with @entity44
but it was at @entity46 that his presence was really felt
when he arrived , the club were not considered title contenders in @entity50 , but with @entity13 's arrival , the southern side were transformed into one of @entity56 football 's dominant forces
during his time with @entity46 , the club won the @entity59 twice , the @entity60 and the @entity61
and his status as a national hero was further cemented during his performances in the 1982 , 1986 and 1990 @entity65
though he briefly shone in his @entity15 debut in 1982 , before an act of petulance saw him sent off against @entity70 , it was the 1986 tournament in @entity71 that @entity13 made his own
@entity13 took the finals by the scruff of the neck , scoring five times , including one of the greatest goals ever scored in the 2 - 1 quarterfinal win over @entity0 -- as well as creating more controversy with his infamous " @entity82 " goal in the same match
but his iconic status as a footballer is only outshone by his wild private life
his time at @entity46 came to an abrupt end after he was found in possession of cocaine , and his last @entity15 as a player , @entity90 1994 , was beset with controversy , as he was sent home early after failing a drugs test
and the @entity13 soap opera has continued after his retirement
since quitting in 1997 , he has spent a great deal of time in drug rehabilitation clinics in @entity98 and @entity99 , where he combated his addiction to cocaine
he has also been subject to dramatic weight gain , struggling with obesity and eventually undergoing gastric bypass surgery to prevent any further fluctuations in his size
in recent years he has also been treated for the affects of alcohol abuse and his health has been a cause for much concern among the world 's sports media
he has been hit by hepatitis at least twice and in 2004 he was rushed to hospital after a heart attack , following a cocaine overdose
and at times he has even seemed mentally unstable -- in a famous incident the one time chat show fired a gun at media waiting outside his house , hitting and injuring four
but , despite the negative stories that have circulated about @entity13 , he is still regarded as a national hero in @entity5
no - one can doubt his skills as a player , but it has certainly raised a few eyebrows that he has been put in charge of an @entity5 team that is struggling to hold its own in the @entity15 qualifiers
whether he can strategize like a professional manager is yet to be seen , but simply by being @entity13 , he will prove to be a great figurehead for the team .
