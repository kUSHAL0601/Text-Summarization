@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is not your average 13 - year - old
while other kids his age spent their saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football , @entity3 traveled from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity12 outside @entity13 dressed in a navy blue @entity15 reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle
surrounding him at the historical site were nearly 200 other buglers and trumpeters from all over the @entity21 , some even coming from as far away as @entity23
a head shorter than his comrades , @entity3 's costume was a tad too big -- so big , in fact , that his mother had to roll up the bottom of his pants three times to make them fit
he did n't seem to notice , though
all he cared about was playing the 24 notes that make up taps
it is perhaps the most famous of military signals , and on saturday it turned 150 years old
taps , traditionally played at military funerals and also known as " @entity41 " or " day is done , " were born during the @entity15 along the @entity42
gen. @entity43 , unhappy with the lights - out call , decided to change the nightly tune to a softer melody , ending up with the tune played today
currently , taps are played at the cemetery about 30 times daily , most notably at the @entity50
to commemorate the 150th anniversary , @entity51 , a nonprofit organization that seeks to play live renditions for veteran funerals rather than subject the mourners to a cd version , enlisted nearly 200 volunteer buglers and trumpeters
the musicians joined together and played a united taps performance before they set off in search of a single soldier 's tombstone in the 624 - acre burial ground
some chose a spot simply for its convenient location
others , like @entity3 , chose them for their significance
one of the youngest volunteers , he selected the grave of @entity72 , a 10 - year - old @entity15 drummer who became a sergeant by the time he turned 12
@entity3 usually plays taps by himself but said it was a great opportunity to play with some of the best buglers in the country on the hallowed ground of the cemetery
he admitted he did n't think a military career was in his future , though
" i do n't think i want to be in the military one day , so the best i can do to serve our country is to honor those who are , " @entity3 said
for those who did serve in the military , playing taps in @entity12 is one of the greatest honors for a bugler
well - known bugle historian and 23 - year veteran @entity91 explained that for him , it 's his way of paying back those who fought for @entity21
" whether it would be after a career , 20 , 30 years , or even those who have died on active duty , it 's our way of officially saying to the military , ' thank you
@entity106 is nigh , ' " he explained , quoting the final lyrics associated with the melody
@entity107 , a patrol officer from @entity108 , @entity109 , usually plays taps at law enforcement funerals and ceremonies in her home state , but said playing in @entity0 was a unique experience
" i started playing the trumpet when i was in fifth grade so i 've been playing for quite a while ... even from that age , i remember visiting here when i just started playing , " said @entity107 , dressed in a black uniform trimmed in gold with her trumpet hanging by her side
" this is like @entity125 for me
this is just an incredible experience
" " [ @entity131 is ] just that final honor to someone who 's served their country , and it 's just such an honor to play that for them , " @entity107 said as she stood opposite the grave she was about to serenade , fingering a commemorative gold coin she would lay to rest on the white marble headstone after her performance
" it 's for the family as well , but i think of it as playing to that person , just a final thank you for what they did
