editor 's note : rep. @entity2 , a @entity3 , represents the 3rd @entity4 in @entity5 and is appearing in @entity7 's " freshman year " series , along with rep. @entity8 , a @entity9 from @entity10
here , his wife , @entity11 , talks about how she copes with the challenges of her freshman year as a " congressional spouse
" @entity11 and her husband , rep. @entity2 , pose in front of a view of @entity18
@entity18 ( @entity7 ) -- in reality , there 's a lot more to serving in @entity5 than simply voting on the @entity23 floor
there are plenty of tasks -- technically optional -- that are essential for someone who wants to do this job well
no one makes you read the bills , but to do the job right , you must
there are constituents to meet with , letters to answer , staff to manage , media to respond to and new bills to research
these duties can eat up as much time as i can give
i 'm learning to balance the workload
the real challenge for me is setting the work aside
my family is still the center of my life
i look forward to that flight home every single weekend
through trial and error , @entity11 and i have learned some important strategies for making our family time count
i have learned to schedule time individually with each of my children
i also schedule time to date my wife
we met at a wedding in @entity63 and started dating shortly after when i was a senior and @entity11 was a junior at @entity65 in 1989
we married in february 1991
@entity11 's challenges are different from mine
i 'll let her explain what it 's like to be a congressional spouse
@entity11 : as i sit down for a moment to type , i 'm strangely aware that 10 - finger typing is much harder than thumb texting -- a symptom of my life
@entity76 seems to be flying , as the saying goes , and it is fun
since @entity2 was elected to @entity5 , i have learned to adapt to many new challenges
@entity2 loves his job ; i love my job
raising three children to be healthy , happy contributors to society is my quest
nurturing our 8 , 13 and 16 - year - olds is a lesson in constant motion -- or rather , commotion
it 's important to me that they feel centered and cared for
although i 'm not a perfect mother , i 've got great kids who reward me with hugs , smiles , occasional pouts and late - night chats
before @entity5 , i tended to deal with things day - by - day
now , time is precious
during our campaign i received some sage advice from @entity63 rep. @entity107 's wife , @entity106
she recommended that when @entity2 is in @entity18 , i spend time doing the things i need to do on my own , such as errands , volunteering , time with friends , helping with homework , and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes , i mastered this skill ! so , when @entity2 is home , we can use our time as a family working , reconnecting and having fun
i 'm a people person
@entity119 and friends are a big part of my support
i 'm the youngest of six and i have an amazing family
my parents and siblings are settled everywhere from @entity126 to @entity63
fortunately , @entity127 is a great midpoint
we regularly have company ; so much so that we 've earned the nickname " @entity132
" for day - to - day support , i 'm lucky to have two very close friends
our kids have grown up together and my friends are always there when i need anything : from picking my kids up from school if i 'm running late , tending our dogs when we travel , or giving me a pep talk just when i need it
i also belong to a book club of six women
we have been laughing , counseling and spilling our guts to each other once a month for the past 16 years
and we still manage to read good books , too
one of my recent favorites is " @entity150 " by @entity151
above all , i have learned to be flexible and keep my sense of humor
recently , i was in @entity18 with @entity2 when he decided the right thing to do was to fly to @entity155 and help some @entity156 out
although i was tempted to be bugged , i chose to be flexible
i spent the rest of my day without @entity2 , flew home alone , and arranged for a ride home from the airport
i 'm the ceo of @entity163 and lovin ' it ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity11 .
