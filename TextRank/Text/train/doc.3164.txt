@entity0 , @entity1 -- the doctor currently in charge of @entity6 ' neurological recovery , the man who 's had his very hands in @entity6 ' brain , was once mistaken for a kung fu expert
it was 1972 , and the second - graders at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , did n't quite know what to make of @entity17 , the boy who 'd just arrived from @entity18
" there were probably not that many @entity21 people there at that time , so a lot of the kids just assumed i knew kung fu , " @entity17 remembered , laughing
" i got some notoriety out of that
i knew nothing about kung fu , but i could kind of fake it and impress people , or at least impress other 7 - year olds
" that boy grew up to be chairman of the director of the @entity34 at @entity35
@entity6 came under his care last week when she was transferred to @entity1 from the @entity37 in @entity38
on monday , @entity17 removed a drain from @entity6 ' brain , which had been placed there to remove excess fluid
@entity17 , whose father was studying library science at @entity45 , recalls his early days in the @entity46 sitting in a classroom not understanding anything " a little anxiety - provoking , but i felt pretty comfortable
" he enjoyed math from the beginning , since the numbers made sense , and within the year , he learned @entity54
" i do think that the immigrant experience is quite a strong one , " he said
" i remember growing up feeling strongly that my parents had come here for me and my sister
i remember them commenting over and over again what a great country this was and how we 're lucky to be here
i think that kind of instills in you that you 're getting this real opportunity and you should try to take advantage of it
" @entity17 's family later moved to @entity70 , and he received his bachelor 's degree from @entity72
medicine was not his first love
" at 18 or 19 , i was trying to write the great @entity46 novel , but i would stare at the page for an hour and half and get two sentences out , so that 's not good , " he said , laughing
" what i wrote did n't read well , even to me
" by his junior year at @entity72 , @entity17 had taken an interest in medicine , and he received his medical degree from the @entity85
within a few years of finishing his residency , he arrived at one of his chosen fields of research , the genetics of brain aneurysms , a condition in which a blood vessel bulges out and can later rupture and bleed , causing a stroke
his interest lay partly in his own family history
three of his four grandparents died of brain hemorrhages , or bleeding in the brain , as did his 37 - year - old uncle , a surgeon who @entity17 says was kidnapped by the @entity103
@entity17 and his team discovered several genes related to aneurysms
he had his parents tested , and both were negative
another area of research involves using stem cells from a patient 's skin to treat spinal cord injuries
the treatments they developed have allowed paralyzed rats to walk again , and they hope to begin studies in humans in the next two to three years
@entity17 says his favorite part of his work is when a patient returns to his office after undergoing a traumatic illness , such as a brain injury , stroke or tumor
" when i first meet a new patient with a new problem , it 's tough for everybody
i 'm worried about them
i feel for what they 're going through , and it 's the best thing to get them through it , " he says
the hardest part of his job is when things do n't go so well
sometimes , for example , he has a patient with cancer , and there are few treatments
or " even worse , " he said , is when a patient has a surgical complication
" no matter who you are , a few times a year , that happens , and the thought that you did something , even though you were trying to help them , and things did n't go well , is very , very difficult , " he says
" but nobody 's perfect , and you ca n't have a 100 % success rate
" as for his most famous patient , @entity17 has very little to say aside from a few comments at news conferences
at a recent interview with @entity2 , a public relations representative from his hospital interrupted whenever a question was asked about @entity6
when asked whether he could n't speak because the hospital had limited him or because @entity6 ' family had asked him not to , he laughed
" i do n't know if i can comment on not commenting , " he said
" it would be dishonest if i said ( treating @entity6 ) was n't different , because there 's all this scrutiny
everybody 's calling , " he added
" certainly , that heightens the situation
" but he knows that doing anything different for her , breaking with regular protocol , would be a mistake
" i think the best way to handle it is in the mechanics of care of the patient is to do everything the same , " he said
" i think you can potentially get into trouble when you try to start doing things differently or making exceptions
