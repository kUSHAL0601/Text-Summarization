-- despite current world player of year @entity4 's recent declaration that he wants to finish his career in his native @entity6 , there are very real concerns about the current well - being of football in the soccer - mad @entity11 nation
@entity4 may be the best player on the planet , but problems both on and off the pitch -- including @entity6 's humiliating 4 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity18 in the 2010 @entity20 finals -- have put immense pressure on the national team to perform well in the @entity24 tournament they currently host
there is no doubt that the tournament is being staged on the back of a traumatic few months for @entity31 football
serious crowd disorder , chronic financial problems , the continued drain of top talent to rich @entity37 clubs and the shock relegation of the mighty @entity39 have all combined to leave many fans with furrowed brows
add to this the apparent strength of traditional rivals @entity45 , who have just won the @entity47 -- the biggest club prize in @entity49 -- with @entity50 , and whose teams are managing to keep hold of their better players due to an improved national economy , and it is clear to see why many are questioning the health of the sport
@entity39 's fate is a warning to @entity62 giants so far , the omens are not looking good
a late goal from @entity65 rescued a point for @entity6 in their opening group match against @entity69
and things got even worse for the hosts in their second group game when they were booed off after a dreadful 0 - 0 draw against @entity74
next monday 's final match against @entity76 is now a must - win affair , with the very real possibility that @entity6 might crash out of the tournament at the first hurdle
@entity0 's @entity82 correspondent @entity81 summed up the mood that pervades many of the passionate followers of football in the nation
" @entity6 have some of the best players in the world and for some reason the team is not producing what it is capable of , " said @entity81
" world - class players like @entity65 ( @entity95 ) and @entity96 ( @entity97 ) can not even get in the side , while other nations would be proud to have players like that in their team , let alone on the bench
" you only had to look at @entity4 's face after wednesday 's match
the team can not get the best out of the world 's top player and things are so bad that radio phone - ins and web sites are calling for the return of ( former national coach ) @entity115 , who was castigated after last year 's @entity20 failure
" @entity31 football legend @entity117 also conceded that the national team have got problems at the moment
@entity117 , a key member of the @entity6 side that won the @entity20 for the first time on home soil in 1978 , told @entity0 : " we have drawn our first two games in the tournament and , to be honest , we were so bad that they could easily have been two defeats
@entity6 booed off after goalless draw " @entity6 are favorites for this tournament , and for them to miss out on reaching the knockout rounds would be unthinkable -- but @entity45 also had a bad start ( 0 - 0 against @entity134 ) so i do n't agree that it is all doom and gloom yet
" i also do n't think @entity139 football is better than us at the moment
both countries went out in the same stage of the @entity20 finals , and although @entity50 won the @entity47 , @entity6 won it with @entity145 in 2009 and @entity146 in 2007
" @entity117 continued : " i do believe the future of @entity139 football is in a better state than ours
the @entity139 economy is strong and they are able to bring back some of their better players from @entity37
i think that will really have an effect on the national team in four or five years time
" the tournament comes just a week after the dramatic demise of @entity39
the most famous football club in @entity6 , and arguably the whole of the continent , are known as @entity162 ( @entity163 ) for good reason
a roll - call of honor that has seen the club lift the @entity169 title a record 33 times , as well as two @entity47 crowns and an @entity172 , proved a distant memory as a steady financial decline , coupled with poor results over the past three years , ultimately proved @entity39 's undoing
their demotion has sent shock waves throughout the country , resulting in a feeling of " mourning , " even for @entity183 fans
riots compound @entity39 's relegation misery however , @entity117 believes the fate of @entity39 , and the current failings of the @entity31 national team are not linked , and they should be viewed in completely different lights
" it 's a tragedy for @entity39 's fans that the club were relegated , but i actually think it shows @entity31 football is in a healthy state , " he told @entity0
" beforehand , people were saying that @entity39 would never be allowed to be relegated , that somehow the football authorities would prevent it -- well , that did not happen
" it is good that smaller clubs can beat the bigger clubs , it is healthy for football and shows a high standard
football thrives on shocks and surprises , and there is something magical about that
" @entity81 followed the @entity39 story closely and was present when the team were finally relegated
" the @entity39 relegation saga captivated the nation , not just football fans , and was front page news for weeks leading up to their decisive playoff match
" the public as a whole viewed what happened at @entity39 , the financial mismanagement of a great team , as symptomatic of what they perceive happens in @entity31 politics and society as a whole -- hence the disbelief at their relegation
" @entity31 soccer hooligans offered @entity20 holiday @entity81 continued : " there is a very real social story to this
@entity39 were ' @entity163 ' not only for the wealth of the side but also for their fans -- who traditionally came from the upper - class north of @entity82
" that is why their demotion has been such a major story , it shows what can happen if there is mismanagement involved
" if the shock of @entity39 's relegation was bad enough , the subsequent crowd disturbances that followed their demise were then graphically viewed around the world
" @entity254 trouble is endemic in @entity31 football , " added @entity81
" the police and football authorities seem unable to contain it , but what happened in the stadium that day was the worse i have ever seen
" i was reporting live for @entity0 , not sport , which gives you an indication how big the story was and , after the game , the supporters took their anger out on everybody , including the media
people in @entity6 were embarrassed by those images going around the world
" with those images of crowd disturbances fresh in the memory , the @entity31 national team are under real pressure to get a victory against @entity76 on monday
anything but a win would see a great football nation suffer the ultimate ignominy on home soil .
