-- as president @entity3 's second - term @entity2 starts to take shape , we can see some of the outlines of what the @entity6 hopes to do in the next four years
the major theme is that @entity3 is prepared to defend his turf , tooth and nail
this is a cabinet whose strength is defense rather than offense
gone are the hopes of bipartisanship
now it 's time to really engage the partisan battle
@entity3 wo n't be pushing for many watershed changes in the next four years , but he is not going to make it easy for @entity22 to make any deep inroads into what he has accomplished
during the last two weeks , the president rolled out his nominations on national security -- sen. @entity29 for secretary of state , sen. @entity30 for secretary of defense , and @entity32 to direct the @entity33
he then nominated his chief of staff , @entity34 , to be secretary of the treasury
we must be careful not to infer too much from presidential appointments , since these people ultimately serve the interests of the president rather than vice versa -- but still , the identities of the members of the new @entity2 provide important hints
this is a team with experience and deep roots in @entity48
it is clear that @entity3 , sobered after four brutal years of fighting with @entity22 in @entity51 , realizes that he needs leaders who have clout in @entity51
on national security , this is a team with deep experience that can protect the existing policies the administration has adopted
@entity3 has selected two @entity60 veterans who are also military veterans , @entity29 and @entity61 , with the hope of using their connections with legislators and their knowledge of the ways and means of the legislative process
though @entity32 does n't come from the @entity60 , he is a veteran in national security circles , having worked at the highest levels of intelligence since the 1990s , and someone who @entity3 clearly feels will be effective in protecting his institutional turf should the legislative waters get rough
the nominations also send the signal that @entity3 will continue to emphasize the kind of pragmatic hawkish agenda that he has embraced from the start of his presidency
since 2009 , @entity3 has generally lived within the policy framework that he inherited from president @entity81
he has kept the national security infrastructure in place , followed through with @entity81 's plans on @entity85 and @entity86 ( withdrawing in the first case and increasing troops , then diminishing @entity90 presence in the second case ) , and strategically employed aggressive military power such as drone strikes and assassinations against the leadership of @entity96
none of his appointees is a dove
@entity29 has frequently authorized the use of military force , including against @entity85
@entity61 is a solid @entity22 who supports using troops when necessary
@entity32 withdrew his name from consideration for the @entity33 in the first term because of statements he made in support of " enhanced interrogation techniques " against detainees
in 2007 , @entity32 had said : " there have been a lot of information that has come out from these interrogation procedures that the agency has in fact used against the real hard - core terrorists
" what the three men have in common is not a predilection to being doves but a belief that force should be employed only when absolutely essential and that war must be a tool of last resort
this is a vision of internationalism that has guided @entity90 policy for much of the period since @entity131 both @entity29 and @entity61 are combat veterans who have seen the costs of war firsthand , and they thus remain more squeamish about making mistakes than many of the civilian leaders who have sent troops into harm 's way
with continued tensions involving countries like @entity144 and @entity145 , this outlook will be an essential brake if pressure to go to war intensifies
for all the alleged controversy over the nominations , what is notable about all three is how they are basically supportive of what @entity3 has done in his first four years and , just as important , much of what @entity81 did during his time in office -- outside of going to war in @entity85
although foreign policy is always hard to predict , since it depends on what others do to us as much as what we decide , this is a @entity2 that signals continuity rather than dramatic change
at @entity166 , the choice of @entity34 sends a slightly different signal
as with the national security nominations , @entity34 is someone with a deep record of experience in @entity48 , having served in many roles in the executive and legislative branches since the 1970s
his appointment shows a shift in concern from banking to budgets
in certain respects , the choice of @entity34 , a veteran of budget wars since the 1990s , signals @entity3 's preparedness to fight @entity22 over spending cuts and the debt ceiling , putting into high office one of his most effective and wily negotiators
but @entity34 is also a progressive , someone who believes deeply that the wealthy should pay their fair share of taxes and that @entity189 and @entity190 must be protected
this will be one of the biggest issues at the center of the upcoming budget wars , and by selecting @entity34 for this job , @entity3 is sending a clear signal that he does not plan to give ground easily on these programs in the months ahead
people who were still hoping for big changes on national security or domestic policy are going to be disappointed
at this point , it 's too early to tell what the appointments say about new initiatives that the administration might pursue , such as immigration reform
but we do know that the president is not planning to give much ground on the programs that are in place
these nominations suggest that the administration is gearing up to fight to defend national security and the major social programs from budget cuts rather than really pushing through big reforms
at the same time , @entity3 has selected some of the toughest fighters in @entity48 , suggesting that if @entity22 want big change , they are going to have to mount a pretty heroic effort to get it done
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .
