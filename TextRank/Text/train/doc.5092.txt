@entity0 , @entity1 -- the man with whom @entity4 had a sexual encounter is soon expected to take the stand in the trial of a former @entity9 student accused of spying on @entity10
wednesday marked the fourth day of @entity12 's trial
prosecutors say he and another student placed a camera in @entity10 's dorm room without his knowledge to allegedly spy on his encounter with the man
prosecutors have withheld the man 's name , listing him only as " @entity24 , " to protect his identity
he is expected to testify thursday
just days after the webcam incident in 2010 , @entity10 committed suicide by jumping off the @entity28 , which connects @entity1 and @entity29
@entity30 , 20 , now faces a 15 - count indictment in @entity10 's death that includes hate crime charges , charges of invasion of privacy , bias intimidation , tampering with physical evidence , witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution
if convicted , he faces up to 10 years in prison
last year , he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time
the deal offered by @entity46 prosecutors would have required the former student to undergo 600 hours of community service , counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the web video with @entity10
prosecutors also offered to help @entity30 avoid deportation , though they said they could not guarantee it
@entity30 is a citizen of @entity55 who had been studying on a visa at the @entity1 university
on tuesday , the second student charged in the case took the stand again , saying she felt " sad " and " overwhelmed " in the wake of the incident
@entity4 , 19 , reached a plea deal that requires her to testify against @entity30
" police officers told me that they believe @entity67 is missing and that he possibly committed suicide and i was feeling very -- i was sad , overwhelmed
i felt very bad if anything had happened , " @entity69 told jurors during her second day of testimony
prosecutor : " these acts were purposeful " should @entity69 complete a three - year program on cyberbullying , as well as 300 hours of community service without any additional legal troubles , charges against her for allegedly watching the video will be dropped , according to prosecutors
she also testified about when she learned of messages @entity30 allegedly sent about the stream
" i was very surprised because my friends brought it up , and i had no idea how they knew , but they said that @entity4 had told them
... they told me about these @entity90 , tweets , that they received on tuesday about him trying to have a viewing party , " said @entity69
less than a month after @entity10 's suicide , president @entity94 released a videotaped message condemning bullying
in november , @entity10 's family consented to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the " @entity102
" the proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid " to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student , " said sen. @entity109 , @entity110 .
