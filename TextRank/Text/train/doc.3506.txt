-- librarians across the @entity2 are making noise about new federal restrictions on lead that could take books out of the hands of children
children 's books are covered by federal regulations on lead in items made for children
the @entity15 requires all products , including books intended for children younger than 12 , to meet new standards calling for lower lead content
commission regulations , written in response to the law , take effect february 10
even stricter limits will become effective in august
@entity26 , ink , covers and glues would need to pass lead content standards
" while we understand the process the @entity36 must carry out in order to ensure this law is properly enforced and that the safety of our nation 's children is protected , we believe the commission is wasting time and resources by zeroing in on book publishers and libraries , " said @entity30 , executive director of the @entity33 @entity32 office
" it is our hope that this matter will be resolved soon , so that libraries can continue their efforts to serve children without the threat of closing their doors
" the @entity36 is expected to issue guidance early next week , said @entity57 , spokeswoman for sen. @entity58 , @entity59 , who sponsored the legislation in the @entity61 last year
the bill , sponsored in the @entity63 by rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , was prompted by a rash of recalls of lead - and phthalate - tainted products , many of which were manufactured in @entity72
long - term exposure to lead can cause nervous system and kidney damage ; speech , language , hearing and behavioral problems ; and learning difficulties , according to the @entity82 's web site
@entity58 is frustrated with the product safety commission
" the new law is not and was not intended to be a one - size - fits - all mandate , " he said in an earlier statement
" there is simply no excuse for the @entity36 's slow action on these rulemakings
" a consumer advocate concurred with @entity58
" i do n't think the law needs to be adjusted , " said @entity92 , director of @entity95 's @entity94 division
" the law provides means for the @entity36 to evaluate and decide whether exemptions should be granted for certain types of products
" @entity36 spokeswoman @entity101 said the agency would comment on the issue later friday
ordinary books that are n't made to be playthings ( such as vinyl bathtub books ) and that do n't have baubles or other materials on their covers have always been exempt from regulations on lead in paint
but the new regulations on lead in children 's products do cover all kinds of books , according to a december 23 letter from the @entity36 's office of general counsel to the @entity122
librarians say there 's no way they can verify the lead content of all the books on their children 's department shelves
" the cost would be unbelievably high for them to test all these books so we could keep them in the library , and how long would we go without them if every library in @entity142 sends them to the same lab , " @entity130 , librarian at the @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity134
@entity92 is unmoved by such arguments
" if libraries can provide evidence that broad classes of books do n't pose a risk of harm to the public health , then they can be granted an exemption from the testing requirements , " he said
" if they ca n't prove that and if the books actually do pose a safety problem , then they should n't be sent home with kids
" publishers -- which will have to prove the safety of new books anyway -- and groups such as the @entity33 could foot the bill for testing older books , he said
" they do n't have to test every book , obviously , " @entity92 said
" they do n't even have to test anywhere near every title
i think they really have to test a reasonable sample size of different classes of books -- different types of binding , different types of materials used
" a coalition of consumer advocacy groups continues to support the law but issued a statement friday that criticized the @entity36 's implementation of it
" while we have urged the @entity15 to promptly address reasonable concerns that have been raised regarding compliance , and provide better information about the new law , our organizations all agree that the law is fundamentally sound and essential to ensuring a safer marketplace , " the statement read
it was signed by @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , kids in @entity198 , @entity2 @entity199 and @entity95
the commission earlier this month clarified the regulations to let resale and thrift shops off the hook for testing the used clothing and other items they sell
those outlets still are expected to watch out for items that have been recalled or banned , the @entity36 said .
