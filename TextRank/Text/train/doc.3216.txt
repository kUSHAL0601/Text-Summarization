-- president @entity1 spoke thursday about the unrest in @entity3 , @entity4 -- an unrest that began in response to the shooting of @entity7 , an 18 - year - old boy with no criminal record
while the community searched for answers about the killing , answers were slow to come -- both from city officials and police
the name of the officer who shot @entity7 was not released until today
citizens , exercising their @entity18 right to peaceful assembly , protested
the police have responded with riot gear , military equipment and tear gas -- banned in international warfare , but used more than once in @entity3
against this backdrop , president @entity1 struck the correct tone , telling the country to " take a step back to think about how to move forward
" he 's tasked both the @entity29 and @entity30 with independently investigating @entity7 's death , and he has spoken with @entity4 's gov. @entity32 about the details on the ground in @entity3
opinion : @entity1 needs to lead on racial profiling legislation while there was no direct mention of the role of race in @entity7 's killing and the protests that ensued , the president emphasized the shared values of all parties involved
he urged the local authorities to be transparent and to protect citizens ' rights to peacefully protest
he urged local citizens to refrain from looting or vandalism and to uphold public order
and he urged everyone to start the path to healing from this tragedy
full coverage of @entity3 shooting i do hope that we can begin on this path of healing , but the events in @entity3 are a microcosm of larger forces that pervade @entity68 society
first , initial eyewitness reports from @entity7 's friends indicate that @entity7 raised his hands and tried to explain he was unarmed , but the police officer began shooting
the tendency to shoot first , ask questions later -- particularly when dealing with young black men -- is an issue the police force must confront
second , the subsequent reluctance of the police to release details about such a grave use of deadly force is of concern
in a democratic society , we need the authorities responsible for protecting us and given authority to apprehend us to be responsive and transparent
5 things to know about @entity7 's shooting third , when the community has a grievance with the authorities , the authorities ' first response should not be an extreme crackdown , characteristic of autocratic countries like @entity96
to send militarized units with combat - like gear and weapons into the heart of a suburban community where protests are occurring , is deeply troubling
fourth , the tendency of some in the mainstream media to use pictures of @entity7 that reinforce a " thuggish " stereotype has to stop
the twitter hashtag # @entity109 has effectively been used to show how the media could reduce an individual to a stereotype with simply one @entity114 picture
opinion : @entity1 , ca n't you see black anger in @entity3 ? the situation in @entity3 is changing hourly , but there is hope
with gov. @entity32 's decision to take law enforcement duties out of the hands of @entity126 and put it into the hands of other law enforcement groups , there could be a return to effective law enforcement
i 'm glad to hear the president will continue to monitor the situation and offer federal support to ensure a transparent investigation
when one of our communities experiences tragedy , it deserves answers and it deserves the right to express grievances
i continue to pray for the family and friends of @entity7 and for a community torn apart to begin to heal .
