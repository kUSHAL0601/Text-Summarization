@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's seafood distribution business is a family affair
in the industrial warehouse that houses @entity11 and @entity12 on the west side of @entity0 , his wife , @entity8 , and four of his seven children load trucks , take phone calls , enter data and help care for his infant grandson , who has a playpen in @entity21 's office
but with portions of @entity1 's controversial immigration enforcement law set to take effect thursday , the business is in limbo
" if people are not eating , we 're not selling , " said @entity27 , a family friend who works in the back office
" we 've lost 60 percent of sales , and right now the future 's uncertain
we do n't know if we 're going to stay in the state ; we do n't know if we 're going to close the business
everything 's up in the air
" most of their clients cater to the @entity41 community , which has effectively gone into hiding amid concerns that they may have to leave the state as soon as the bill becomes law , @entity27 said
a key part of @entity1 's immigration law was temporarily blocked by a judge wednesday
this means police wo n't be required to ask people about their immigration status
@entity54 : what does @entity1 immigration ruling mean ? but for the @entity21 family business and others like it , the damage from the controversy already is done
reduced spending in restaurants , grocery and retail stores has triggered a domino effect among businesses in the metro @entity0 business community and throughout @entity1
to stay afloat even as their clients disappear or reduce inventory orders , the business has reduced employees ' hours and cut back operations in the industrial warehouse , home to several large freezers and forklifts and an office sparsely decorated with posters of illustrated fish and cuts of meat
perhaps the toughest decision was to halt lines of credit to customers , even those with good history , she said
" we ca n't really offer credit anymore because we do n't know if next week they 're going to close the business , " @entity27 said
" but it 's also a downside because some customers need that credit to operate
" firm numbers illuminating the economic fallout of @entity100 are hard to come by as the bill has yet to take effect
also , summer tends to be slow for business and tourism in @entity1 because it 's so hot
but anecdotal evidence from business owners , real estate agents and community leaders indicates the mere specter of the bill has created a culture of fear among @entity41 in @entity1 that 's slowly paralyzing sectors of the economy
@entity41 make up 30 percent of the state 's population
the state 's unemployment rate in june rose for the third month in a row , to 9.7 percent
gov. @entity121 signed the bill in april
traditionally , community groups look to indicators such as the housing market , school enrollment and data from utility companies to track economic fluctuations within a certain group , said @entity131 , president and ceo of @entity133 , a community outreach program in @entity0
based on feedback from clients and preliminary data , @entity131 said his group estimates that rental vacancies in predominantly @entity41 neighborhoods will be 10 to 15 percent higher than the normal rate of 12 percent
" people are scared , and they do n't want to wait around to find out what 's going to happen with @entity100 , " said @entity131 , whose group offers housing , economic and education services to low - income families and individuals , both undocumented and @entity148 - born
" regardless of their status , people are frustrated with an environment that 's not accepting and potentially threatening , and they 're fed up with being targeted and singled out by law enforcement
it 's driving them out of the state , and not necessarily to better situations
" reactions to the @entity1 immigration law injunction the @entity1 housing market , which was already suffering from one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , has also taken an extra hit since the passage of the law , according to real estate agents who spoke with @entity2
some homeowners who purchased property in the past year are looking to unload , according to @entity169 , a real estate agent who sells residential properties in neighborhoods in @entity0 's @entity41 communities
" most families usually have one person who does n't have papers , and they do n't want to risk being arrested and splitting up the family by staying in @entity1 , " said @entity169 , who is married to one of the daughters of @entity4 , the owner of @entity11 and @entity12
even during the recession , @entity169 said business was good because property was cheap , and that in better times , he closed an average of five transactions a month
since the beginning of the year , however , he has been lucky to sell two properties in a month , and in july , he has n't closed a single deal
" i had investors buying properties , but now 's who gon na rent them ? " he said
commercial real estate developer @entity193 was in the same situation leading up to wednesday 's ruling
since april , clients in predominantly @entity41 neighborhoods across the state had been pulling out of properties or calling to relay concerns over whether they should stay if the law goes into effect
today , @entity193 said he received several calls from clients expressing relief and letting him know they intended to stay
" the ruling today has definitely been a move in the right direction for commercial tenants and their customers , who 've been scared that @entity1 was n't going be friendly to @entity214 community , " he said
" this gives the federal government to get to work implementing an immigration policy that the @entity148 people will support unanimously and deals with the situation at the border , which is where the real problem is
" @entity0 's sprawling concrete landscape bears testimony to the abundance of vacant residential and commercial property
" for sale " signs in @entity228 and @entity231 adorn brown , sun - scorched lawns and dilapidated parking lots alike , from the heart of downtown @entity0 to as far as @entity234 and @entity235 -- the district of @entity100 's sponsor , @entity238 sen. @entity238
boarded - up big - box stores loom large in their vast emptiness , and rows of abandoned strip mall storefronts outnumber those that are occupied in some parts
not only businesses targeting the @entity41 community are suffering
economic boycotts adopted by other states and cities have hit @entity1 's meeting and convention business
since groups nationwide began announcing boycotts of the state because of @entity100 , at least 40 meetings have been canceled
that 's resulted in the loss of $ 12 million in lodging alone , according to @entity259 , spokeswoman for the @entity260
summer is typically the low season , she noted , and pointed out that tourism was up 8 percent statewide in june 2010 compared with june 2009 , which was one of the " worst summers ever " because of the recession
despite that slight uptick , more telling is the lack of inquiries for future bookings , she said
" what we 're hearing from meeting planners now is they wo n't and ca n't consider @entity1 for 2011 , 2012 meetings not necessarily because of their own stance on @entity100 or the boycott but just because they want to avoid the controversy and do n't want to risk losing attendance , " she said
the absence of meetings and conventions not only affects the hotel industry and its 200,000 employees , but also ancillary businesses such as restaurants , retailers and taxis , @entity259 said
it seems that not even fast - food joints are immune to the encroaching economic fallout of @entity100
as the four @entity4 children stood with their parents in their office wednesday , recounting tales of friends and relatives who have left town or seen families torn apart , daughter @entity293 noted her surprise at seeing a shuttered @entity303
" i was driving down @entity304 with my dad and @entity303 was closed , and i was like , when have you seen that ? like @entity303 -- everybody goes to @entity303 , and that was closed down
