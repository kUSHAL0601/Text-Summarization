editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of a new book , " @entity4 : getting down to the @entity5 , " to be published in march
he provides commentary on @entity9 's " @entity8 " daily from 4 to 7 p.m. et. you can also visit @entity2 's @entity12 blog
@entity2 says @entity13 understands that the @entity14 is the " people 's house
" @entity17 ( @entity9 ) -- i think i am developing a crush on @entity21 's first lady
@entity13 is more compelling than her husband
he 's good , but she 's utterly fascinating
mrs. @entity13 has blown away the stale air in a @entity14 musty from eight years of the @entity26
it 's like the sun came out and a fresh spring breeze began wafting through the open windows
it 's the people 's house , and @entity13 totally gets it
so much so that she has taken to inviting people in from the streets to see her home
nice touch -- one completely lacking in her recent predecessors
watch her when she visits a local school and you see the warmth and affection she instantly triggers in people
kids are pretty much totally honest with very good bs - detectors
if they sense you 're a phony , forget it
but around the first lady , they want to hug her and laugh with her and tell her stories
you can see the same qualities these kids recognize in her daughters
she is the consummate mother as evidenced by the poised , polite smiling children she and her husband are raising
i have four daughters , and trust me -- they do n't turn out like the @entity13 children without devoted parents
new to the @entity62 neighborhood , @entity13 has taken it upon herself to go around and introduce herself to the people in the various agencies of government
when 's the last time a first lady did that ? i do n't ever remember it before
and during her visits she listens rather than lectures
and people respond to her
she was raised on the south side of @entity75 by blue - collar parents
she went to @entity77 , and @entity78
but in many ways she 's still a kid from the south side of @entity75 , and that 's what makes her special
she knows exactly who she is
the @entity84 bring a humanity and humility to their tasks which sets them far apart from the run - of - the mill phonies who populate @entity62
it 's exactly what the doctor ordered for this wounded nation
@entity13 's unassuming , but dead - on , sense of style has the fashion press gushing all over itself
her arms are becoming the stuff of legend
who appears sleeveless on the cover of @entity105 , let alone in front of a joint session of @entity108 while her husband delivers one of the most important speeches of his life ? and the reviews were rave
@entity114 , the editor of @entity115 gushed , " @entity116 ! the first lady has bare arms in @entity108 in february at night ! " if she keeps it up , @entity119 will soon stop making women 's clothes with sleeves
ok , i admit it
when it comes to the first lady , i 'm smitten
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
