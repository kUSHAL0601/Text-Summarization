@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prime minister @entity3 , no stranger to verbal gaffes , has come under fire again for a remark that critics say makes light of rape
in 2008 @entity3 claimed right - wing female politicians were better looking than their left - wing counterparts
while campaigning for local elections in @entity13 sunday , @entity3 was asked by reporters to comment about an interior ministry proposal to deploy troops on city streets after a series of sexual assaults on women
" we ca n't think of deploying a large force , " @entity3 said
" we would have to send as many soldiers as there are beautiful girls
and i do n't think we would manage
" the comment drew widespread criticism , including from his political opponents
opposition leader @entity30 accused the prime minister of " ignoring the seriousness of sexual violence
" later , @entity3 said he meant his remarks as a " a compliment
" " women have to be defended , " he said
( sexual violence ) " is a trauma that remains for life
" a series of violent attacks prompted the proposal to deploy troops
on @entity45 , a woman was raped in @entity0
and on friday , a group of men attacked a couple , tying up the man and repeatedly raping his girlfriend
the conservative leader has a long record of questionable comments
he was criticized in november after he told president @entity54 of @entity55 that president @entity59 " has all the qualities to get along well with you : he 's young , handsome and suntanned
" and in run up to the 2008 @entity1 general election , @entity3 claimed that right - wing female politicians were better looking than their left - wing counterparts .
