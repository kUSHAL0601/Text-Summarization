" she wanted to be an angel , she wanted to be an air hostess , " her mother said of @entity13
" if she was still here i would do everything to support her , but now i have nothing left
" @entity13 's sister , one of two who was traveling with her on the overnight train from southern @entity22 on saturday , wrote on @entity23 of her guilt at not being able to protect her
" @entity13 , i am so sorry that i failed to look after you
i am a terrible sister
please forgive me , " she wrote , according to the @entity26
@entity27 turned to horror it was @entity13 's first time on a train
she was returning from the city of @entity34 with her two sisters and one of their boyfriends to the @entity34 capital @entity0 , a popular route for tourists going to and from the country 's popular southern beaches
they were sharing a sleeping carriage , and turned in for the night
by the morning @entity13 was gone
police searched the train and the track as the teenager 's frantic family turned to the media for help in finding her
three days later , her body was found naked near the track ; she 'd been raped , suffocated and tossed out of a window by her attacker who told police he had been drinking and was high on methamphetamine , according to @entity45 major general @entity61
@entity62 down by phone police named @entity13 's alleged murderer as 22 - year - old railway employee @entity66
they said he confessed to the crime after he was tracked down via his victim 's mobile phone
@entity66 sold the girl 's phone to a shop owner in @entity0 , who took a copy of his i.d. which was later passed to police
police said @entity66 admitted carrying the sleeping child to another carriage where he raped and strangled her , before throwing her lifeless body out the window as the train passed through the @entity84 in @entity85
@entity66 has been charged with murder , rape of a child under 15 years old and theft , police said
he faces possible execution for the murder charge , but activists are using the case to call for tougher charges for child rape , which currently carries a jail term of four to 20 years and a fine of up to 40,000 baht ( $ 1,200 )
rage vented online the reaction on social media was swift and scathing as angry @entity102 bombarded @entity66 's @entity23 page with abusive messages
the page is no longer available
junta leader , army chief @entity106 , expressed his sorrow , and the former transport minister , @entity108 , said he took the blame for failing to do more when he was in charge of the railway
" it is the worst news in many years for the @entity114 and the @entity115
i feel that i am also responsible for this event , because i did not do my job well enough when i was the minister , " @entity108 said
as word spread that @entity13 had gone missing , @entity34 actress and former @entity22 , @entity119 , posted a message on @entity122 urging people to back a campaign to change the law under the slogan , " rape , will be executed
" a change.org petition was set up calling for the tougher penalties -- " no more sentence reduction , parole or pardon " -- which at the time of writing had more than 25,000 signatories
there were also calls for @entity114 governor @entity137 to step down , as officials scrambled to assure passengers the trains were safe
a ban would be slapped on the sale of alcohol on all trains , they said , and background checks would be stepped up for all employees
are new laws the answer ? amid the anger , some called for calm
" we have to listen to this news with full consciousness
to design or change a law base on emotions and hatred will never produce effective law
it will only promote more hatred in society , " said @entity159 , chairman of @entity160 of @entity22
writing in the @entity26 , columnist @entity164 said : " i seriously doubt if the angry calls for the death penalty as the only punishment for child rapists and rapists / murderers will make our society any safer
" these calls stem from the belief that this heinous crime was possible because the punishment is not heavy enough
we hear such calls every time a shocking rape or murder happens
