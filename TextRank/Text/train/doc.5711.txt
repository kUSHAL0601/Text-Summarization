-- @entity2 inspectors will travel to @entity4 " as soon as possible " to investigate three reports of chemical weapons use , a @entity2 spokesperson said wednesday
the announcement of the upcoming visit followed talks last week between @entity4 's government and a @entity2 representative for disarmament affairs , according to the @entity2 statement
@entity4 has been embroiled in a bloody civil war for more than two years , during which more than 100,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced or become refugees in other countries , according to the @entity2
amid the fighting , there have been numerous allegations that chemical weapons have been used
in june , the @entity23 said @entity4 president @entity25 's forces had crossed a " red line " by using chemical weapons , including the nerve agent sarin gas , against rebel forces
this prompted the @entity32 government to begin providing military support to opposition fighters , despite its earlier reluctance to do so
@entity4 's government , meanwhile , has claimed rebel fighters have used chemical weapons as well
that includes a march incident in @entity40 in the northern province of @entity42 , according to state media
opposition officials have said rebels do n't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack , while other rebel leaders said @entity4 troops fired " chemical rockets " at civilians and opposition forces
the @entity40 will be one of the three incidents that @entity2 inspectors will look into during their upcoming visit , according to the @entity2 spokesperson .
