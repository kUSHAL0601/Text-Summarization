@entity0 , @entity1 -- an earthquake in @entity1 , powerful enough to prompt the appearance of a small island off the coast , has killed more than 200 people , @entity1 officials said
the 7.7 - magnitude quake struck in a remote area of southwestern @entity1 on tuesday , but it had severe consequences
at least 208 people were killed in the district of @entity15 and the city of @entity17 in @entity19 province , @entity12 , the provincial home secretary , said wednesday
in addition to the fatalities , around 350 people have been injured , he said , and more people are still trapped in rubble
the quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20 to 30 feet high to emerge from the @entity28 like a small mountain island off the coast of @entity31 , local police official @entity25 said
a large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island , he said
large quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth 's crust , particularly visible along coastlines
the island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast , @entity40 reported
@entity44 , principal seismologist for the @entity45 , confirmed the island had formed
he said it was " not surprising , " considering the magnitude of the earthquake
but @entity50 , a geophysicist with the @entity51 , said that generally it would be unlikely for such a large island to emerge from a quake like tuesday 's
many things , such as the tide , could come into play regarding the rise of the island , he said
more than 1,000 troops will be sent to the area to provide aid , including rescue teams and medical teams , maj. gen. @entity60 said
with a depth of about nine miles ( about 15 kilometers ) , the quake struck 43 miles ( 69 kilometers ) northeast of @entity15 and 71 miles ( 114 kilometers ) northwest of @entity68 , the @entity51 said
some mud - walled homes fell in @entity15 , said @entity70 , director of the @entity71 in @entity19
the tremors lasted two minutes
people flocked out onto the streets of @entity75 , the provincial capital
aftershocks could be felt in @entity77 , hundreds of miles to the southeast
@entity2 's @entity79 and @entity80 , and journalist @entity81 contributed to this report .
