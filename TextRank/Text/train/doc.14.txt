@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity2 has asked @entity4 staff to draw up plans for shutting the @entity7 prison camp at @entity8 , @entity9 , a @entity4 spokesman said
a detainee is seen through a fence in july at the @entity7 prison camp at @entity8 , @entity9
the camp holds about 250 suspected terrorists , down from a peak of roughly 750 men from 40 countries
it houses several top @entity20 figures , including @entity21 -- the confessed architect of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks
@entity2 " has asked his team for a proposal on how to shut it down , what would be required specifically to close it and move the detainees from that facility , while at the same time , of course , ensuring that we protect the @entity7 people [ from ] some very dangerous characters , " @entity4 press secretary @entity24 said thursday
@entity24 described it as a contingency plan in case the new administration wants to take it up early in the new year
president - elect @entity42 has pledged to close the camp at @entity8 but has n't set a specific timetable
@entity45 will continue as defense secretary when @entity42 takes office
" i would like to see it closed , " @entity2 told @entity48 in a @entity50 interview
" and i think it will be a high priority for the new administration
" officials close to the @entity42 team said in november that the incoming administration is pondering options , including trying some of the @entity8 inmates in federal courts , setting up a special national security court to deal with cases involving the most sensitive intelligence information , and releasing some inmates
in an october 31 interview with @entity1 , @entity42 said only that he would close the facility " as quickly as we can do prudently
" " i am not going to give a time certain because i think what we have to do is evaluate all those who are still being held in @entity70 , " he said
" we have to put in place appropriate plans to make sure they are tried , convicted and punished to the full extent of the law , and that 's going to require , i think , a review of the existing cases , which i have not had the opportunity to do
" in may , @entity2 told a @entity80 committee that efforts to shut down the facility were " stuck " over what to do with the inmates .
