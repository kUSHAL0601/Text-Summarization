-- when @entity2 passed the last truly major immigration reform , the @entity3 that opened the door to the modern era of mass immigration to the @entity7 , it was supported by three - quarters of @entity9 lawmakers and 85 % of @entity10
that 's the right way to pass big laws that can have transformative effects on a society
with the @entity16 now tangling over immigration reform following passage of a comprehensive @entity20 bill last month , there seems little prospect for anything approaching that level of comity
indeed , as @entity2 heads to its august break , many have declared the @entity20 immigration reform bill dead on arrival
but the road ahead may not be as impassable as it seems
a new poll from a pro-immigration @entity32 group shows that nearly three - quarters of @entity32 voters would support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants if coupled with tougher border security
there is surprising bipartisan agreement on most of the @entity20 bill 's provisions and plausible paths on the very tough issues that still divide the two parties
here 's a way to get across the finish line : emphasize agreement
expanding high - skilled immigration , luring immigrant entrepreneurs , requiring employers to verify the legal status of new hires and admitting more farmworkers all enjoy overwhelming bipartisan backing
the @entity9 have also agreed to eliminate the diversity visa lottery and end family visas for brothers and sisters of new @entity7 citizens , responding to longstanding @entity32 concerns that the current system is too generous to those with weak ties to the @entity7
as they meet with their constituents in august , lawmakers should emphasize that these measures would be a shot in the arm for the still anemic @entity7 economy and would go a long way to discouraging future illegal immigration
there are , to be sure , many members of the @entity16 who will not vote for any sort of comprehensive immigration legislation , and there 's no point in supporters of reform wasting their time to try to win them over
@entity9 have put together a list of more than 100 @entity10 who might be persuaded to support broader immigration reform
even potential @entity32 supporters do not trust the @entity86 administration on enforcement , particularly on securing the @entity89 border , and there is little reason to think this view will change
fortunately , these lawmakers do n't need to
this bill will set immigration rules for a generation ; president @entity86 will be gone in a few years
what is needed is a closer , ongoing relationship between @entity2 and the professionals responsible for border security -- the @entity101 and @entity102 agents
the @entity103 already passed a bill in may -- unanimously -- that would be an important start , because it requires those agencies to develop , present to @entity2 and carry out a clear strategy for further securing the border
for the @entity32 to reject the new border enforcement resources that will come with an immigration bill because they do n't trust @entity86 is like refusing to pay for new @entity113 weapons programs as long as @entity9 are in charge
border security must be an ongoing mission of national importance that , like national defense , requires a close working relationship between the professionals in uniform and the politicians -- one that transcends the party in power
verification is particularly difficult because the administration has not provided @entity2 with any good measures for success on immigration enforcement at all
the @entity20 bill instead just spends more -- doubling yet again the number of agents and building more fencing
but as we 've learned from the public schools , more money does not always equal better results
instead , @entity2 should demand performance and accountability on such key measures as the apprehension rate of illegal border crossers and the number of those who overstay visas
fortunately , these provisions are already in the @entity103 bill
emphasizing this fact would meet a key demand of many wavering @entity32 members -- to demonstrate genuine results on border security rather than just throwing more money at the problem
many paths to citizenship , or not
all but the staunchest opponents of immigration reform accept that most of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants here today can not simply be deported
but the @entity9 ' insistence on a certain , if lengthy , path to citizenship for all is misplaced
the fact is that many of the unauthorized will never seek citizenship ; of the 2.7 million who were legalized by the 1986 @entity169 , a little more than 1 million later became citizens , fewer than four out of 10
this low number is not an argument for denying citizenship ; a great strength of the @entity7 has been to integrate immigrants as full members of society , and the bill needs to hold open that possibility
but the first priority for both parties should be to free those 11 million from the daily threat of being fired , arrested and deported
instead of a special path to citizenship , there could be many paths -- quicker for young people , for example , but through normal work and family channels for others
as with immigrants who try to enter through legal channels , some may never qualify for citizenship
while this will be the toughest issue to resolve , leaders in both parties should be able to find a sensible compromise
already there is significant movement ; @entity16 @entity10 are working on a version of the @entity204 to allow the children of unauthorized immigrants to become citizens , a policy they had long rejected
sen. @entity209 , @entity211 - @entity210 , who championed immigration reform despite strong criticism in his home state , has said that if @entity2 fails this time , it will be a generation before it dares to take up the issue again
there is no need to wait that long ; the pieces for an ambitious and broadly supported bill are all in place
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .
