yes , @entity0 got a lot less snow than forecast
yes , if we had known there would be this little snow , things probably would n't have needed to get shut down as much as they were
but most of the complaining -- about either the forecast or the decisions by local and state governments -- is misguided
first of all , taking a look at the big picture , this storm was forecast pretty well
the forecast was that a big storm would develop rapidly and cause heavy snow across much of the coastal northeast , from @entity21 up through @entity22 , as well as high winds and coastal flooding
the peak snow accumulations are coming in as high as advertised , just not in @entity0
there were very sharp gradients in the snow accumulations
that is , big differences over short distances
so a small eastward shift in the track of the storm was enough to take away most of our snow
just 10 or 20 miles east of the city , in @entity39 , snow totals are much higher
the reality is that weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain
forecasters are looking at a range of possibilities , as spelled out in different model simulations
they have to choose among them , or split the difference in some way
but there is no perfect way to know which is right , and there never will be
the science tells us that that is the nature of weather prediction : the information is inherently uncertain
that 's just how it is
some meteorologists apologize the right way to communicate uncertain information , really , is through probabilities
the models showed a sharp gradient in snowfall , but showed @entity0 on the snowy side
however , it was also clear that if the track were wrong , the city might avoid the worst of the snow
that uncertainty was n't fully communicated
that suggests that if this storm points to a failure , it 's really a failure not of the specific forecast , but of the format and language that is used to communicate all forecasts , an approach that fails to clearly spell out uncertainties and the difficulty of picking one of a number of potential storm tracks
of course , that has nothing to do with the complaints about the transit shutdowns , because those decisions could -- and perhaps should -- have been made regardless
but it 's important to remember that despite the uncertainties , decision makers have to make decisions , and being under - prepared for a storm that turns out to be worse than the forecast can lead to serious loss of life and property
being over-prepared , in contrast , merely leads to lots of griping on the @entity102
in the face of uncertainty , the right thing to do is almost always going to be to assume the worst - case scenarios
maybe some decisions could have been different given what was known at the time ( in particular , the subway shutdown might have been unnecessary even if the snow totals had come in as high as forecast )
but it 's still way too easy for those of us with no responsibility to play monday morning quarterback
and overall , given the uncertainty of the different models -- and the fine line between the correct call and an inaccurate one -- the authorities look to have taken the right approach in being proactive
good weather forecasts and well - informed , proactive emergency preparation and management save lives and property
those are great benefits to society , and if people take them for granted most of the time , that 's ok
but it 's also important to understand that the unavoidable cost of enjoying these benefits is that sometimes , the problem wo n't be as bad as forecast , and so some decisions might seem unnecessary after the fact
so next time there is a forecast of a big storm , do n't be tempted to disbelieve it just because you think this one was overblown
after all , there are many people in parts of @entity148 and @entity149 right now who will be very glad indeed about the weather forecasters ' -- and their elected officials ' -- caution
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .
