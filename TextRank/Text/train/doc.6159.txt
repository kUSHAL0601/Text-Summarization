president @entity0 told a @entity2 meeting on tuesday that pollution must be contained to address climate change
specifically , he called out @entity5 , saying that the most populous country on @entity7 , with the fastest increase in carbon pollution , must join the @entity10 to lead the rest of the world in carbon reduction
" we have a responsibility to lead , " @entity0 said to applause
" that 's what big nations have to do
" @entity0 was speaking at the @entity20 , a one - day meeting hosted by @entity2 secretary - general @entity22 and open to leaders of all 193 @entity2 member states
wednesday begins the @entity26 meeting , which has marked climate change as one of its top issues as well
the event offers @entity0 a chance to shift the conversation away from the threat posed by @entity35 , @entity36 , and other national security matters and focus on an issue where he can tout accomplishments
hours after ordering strikes on @entity41 , @entity0 said that the " urgent and growing threat of climate change " would ultimately " define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other " issue
obtaining broad agreement to combat global climate change does not come easy , an issue the president addressed
for instance , @entity5 has been reluctant to stem the influx of energy production , as it 's in more demand
and in the @entity10 , the issue is controversial , with some claiming to believe that humans do n't cause climate change
" in each of our countries , there are interests that will be resistant to action
in each country there is a suspicion that if we act and other countries do n't -- that we will be at an economic disadvantage
but we have to lead , " @entity0 said
@entity0 painted a tragic picture caused by a changing climate in the @entity10 , detailing floods in @entity74 , wildfires in the @entity70 , hurricanes in the north and drought followed by excessive rain in the middle of the country
@entity0 noted that some countries are more impacted than others by climate change , but said , " no nation is immune
" actions announced the president unveiled a series of actions to urge the international community to cut emissions
he also announced measures to help developing countries better prepare for climate change
while efforts are still under way to meet and exceed goals set for 2015 , the president outlined a partnership plan to meet additional carbon reduction goals by 2020
" we can not condemn our children and their children to a future that is beyond their capacity to repair -- not when we have the means , the technological innovation and the scientific imagination to begin the work of repairing it right now , " he said
" i believe in the words of dr. @entity107 that there is such a thing as being too late
" actions taken so far in june 2013 , @entity0 announced a plan to cut carbon pollution , including directing the @entity10 @entity113 to establish new emission standards for active coal plants in the @entity10 , and working with other countries including @entity5 and @entity117 -- two of the world 's top emitters of greenhouse gases -- to establish new plans for addressing pollution globally
the plan included many executive actions -- things that do n't need approval from @entity127 , such as new standards for coal plants -- that were controversial
a year later , in june , 2014 , the @entity113 proposed a new plan designed to cut carbon emissions by 30 % by the year 2030
that plan has become a popular subject in several @entity133 races this year , including @entity134 and @entity135
still to be done for the environmental community , the next big frontier to tackle is methane emissions -- different from carbon emissions but , environmentalists say , just as important in the fight against climate change
" for us the big next steps include making a decision to address methane pollution from the oil and gas sector , " said @entity143 , director of the international climate campaign at the @entity145 , one of the country 's oldest environmental organizations
" that 's one of the biggest unresolved pieces
" polling a demonstration in @entity158 on sunday featuring appearances from @entity2 leader @entity22 and actor @entity160 , among others , turned out tens of thousands of supporters , but polling indicates that many @entity10 do not list addressing climate change as an issue they believe should be a top priority for the president and @entity127
a @entity169 research poll conducted earlier this year found that 29 % of respondents listed " dealing with global warming " as a top policy priority -- and that number has remained virtually unchanged since @entity0 took office in 2009
and a @entity176 poll conducted in march 2014 , found that a little under a fourth of @entity10 -- 24 % -- list climate change as a national problem that they worry about " a great deal
" however , when it comes to addressing climate change , polling indicates most @entity10 back action
a @entity176 poll from june found that 65 % of those surveyed support the government tightening pollution regulations on businesses .
