-- @entity1 is hoping to perform another @entity3 rescue act after being confirmed as the new manager of bottom club @entity5 on saturday
the 65 - year - old , who kept both @entity7 and @entity8 in the @entity10 top flight , has replaced @entity11
the @entity12 was fired on friday after 11 months in charge , having failed to win a league match this season
@entity1 , who was interested in becoming coach of the @entity18 national team , was at @entity19 on saturday for @entity5 ' game against @entity21
winless @entity5 sack @entity11 @entity1 has been out of work since being sacked by @entity8 five months ago , having taken the @entity25 club to fourth in the @entity3 but missing out on another @entity27 campaign after @entity30 's @entity29 triumph in may
" i 'm delighted to be back in the managerial hot - seat at @entity5 , " said @entity1 , who won the @entity31 with @entity7 in 2008 after returning the club following a controversial move to neighboring @entity34 , who were relegated in 2005
" when i spoke to the shareholders and they told me about their plans i knew this was too good an opportunity to turn down
" there 's no doubt there 's a lot of ability in the squad , but for one reason or another things have n't gone as well as everyone expected since the start of the season
" i ca n't wait to get to work and get the results necessary to kickstart our season
" @entity1 was named @entity3 manager of the year for 2009 - 10 after taking @entity8 to @entity27 qualification for the first time , and he guided the team to the quarterfinals in @entity61 the following season
he had taken over with the club bottom of the @entity3 in october 2008 with just two points from eight games , but guided @entity8 to eighth place
the former @entity68 manager was favorite to take over as @entity70 boss when @entity71 quit in february this year , but -- although he was cleared in a high - profile tax court case -- missed out to @entity73 and was then sacked after a poor finish to the season
" @entity1 was our number one target , the unanimous choice of the board and we 're delighted we 've been able to attract him to the club , " @entity5 chairman @entity76 said
" he has a proven track record in the @entity3 and has all the characteristics we were looking for to get us out of the current situation we find ourselves in
" his man - management skills are second to none and we are confident he is the right man to lead us away from the bottom of the table
" @entity1 said on friday he had been " close " to filling @entity18 's vacant coaching role
" it was a job which excited me
we met the people and they were fantastic , " he said
" it was exciting and something i 'd never done in my life and something i was really up for
" but when @entity11 left the job it changed everything
yesterday , i was almost on my way to @entity18
but when i got the phone call it changed everything around
