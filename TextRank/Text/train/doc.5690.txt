-- here 's what you need to know about @entity4 : you ca n't make any joke about him that he has n't made about himself , because he loves to play the victim
" it 's like a roast
or @entity12 with ' @entity13 , ' " he says
" i giggle when i put myself down
it 's just funny to me
" after his glory days of chilling major as the weasel on @entity18 and his foray into mainstream movies with stoner comedies like " @entity22 " and " bio-dome , " @entity4 's career stalled
it was when the offers dried up that @entity4 took matters into his own hands and created a new character : self - deprecating former star
he threw himself into stand - up and began creating starring roles for himself once again with independent films that he wrote , directed and produced
" you 've got two choices , " he says
" you can either make a s -- tload of money -- not me personally , but someone in the business who 's very box office - friendly -- being cast in other people 's stuff or do what i 'm doing and not make any money but be 100 % in control of it and make it exactly how i want it to be
" his latest project is a comedy special , " vegas is my oyster , " airing on @entity53 now
" @entity52 " is a throwback to old - time variety shows , and in it , @entity4 plays the emcee and straight man trying to corral wildcards like @entity60 and @entity61 during the @entity62 weekend in @entity51
former @entity64 goddess @entity63 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 also make appearances
" it 's quite a feat to try and pull off a show with all these people , getting them there , having them show up that night sober and looking good , " @entity4 said
but after contemplating every painstaking detail , down to which scalloped curtain to hang on stage , he 's proud of his work
" it 's shot well ; it 's sexy ; it 's no - holds - barred and edgy
my main goal is to do something entertaining , and we 're pushing the envelope on this particular show
i loved having the porno awards be the backdrop
" @entity4 is no stranger to a fast lifestyle
his comedian father , @entity90 , was @entity92 's opening act and founded @entity93 in @entity94
his mother , @entity95 , has been running the club since 1973
from an early age , @entity4 was around lady - loving , hard - partying legends like @entity99 and @entity100
back in his @entity18 days , he romped with " @entity101 , " and he 's been a frequent guest at the @entity102
" i think i 'm living a lot of guys ' dreams
for sure , " he says
" but i am a guilt - free person , " he continues
" unlike @entity106 or @entity107 or any of these guys that live the unfaithful , cheating lie , or even women who live that lie , i 'm not that person
i was when i was younger , but i chose the wrong girls to date
now i still choose those girls , but i also know that it 's not going anywhere
i do n't promise them anything ; they do n't promise me anything
i have enough drama in my own life
plus , i like having different girlfriends in different places that i travel
" if @entity123 , 43 , were to settle down , he says a @entity125 type is his ideal
" at the end of the day , i think , do n't quote me on this -- and you can even say do n't quote me -- that 's probably the type of girl that i would wind up with
she loves him and protects him but also manages him and cares for him
i think if @entity135 did n't have @entity125 , he would be dead by now
" until that love comes along for him , @entity4 will be on the road
" remember that ( life cereal ) commercial , ' i know , let 's get @entity140 to do it ! ' i 'm like the @entity140 of comedians , " he says
" i go to markets that no one would ever go to
people always ask me , who are your fans ? my fans are people that live in @entity151 , @entity152 , and also ( the ) @entity153
