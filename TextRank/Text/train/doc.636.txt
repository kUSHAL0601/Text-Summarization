@entity0 in northern @entity1 has long been a treasure trove for archeologists , but a recent discovery of part of a 4,000 - year - old @entity7 sphinx has been a most unexpected find
inexplicably buried far from @entity7 , the paws of a sphinx statue , resting on its base , have been unearthed with an inscription in hieroglyphs naming @entity15
the pharaoh ruled in 2500 @entity17 and oversaw the construction of one of the three @entity20 , where he was enshrined
" once in a lifetime you find something like this , " says @entity21 , the director of the excavation and a professor at @entity24 , which sponsors the archeological digging
" this is of extreme importance from many points of view , since it is the only sphinx of this king known in the world -- even in @entity7
it is also the only monumental piece of @entity7 sculpture found anywhere in the @entity45 , " he said , referring to the region spanning the east of the @entity40
@entity21 says the sphinx was deliberately broken , as were about 10 other @entity7 statues that had been previously found there
when cities fell , he said , most statues had their heads and hands cut off
" this is what happened to this one here
he lost his hands , " @entity21 said
the full sphinx is estimated to have been a meter tall , weighing half a ton

as for the biggest question of all -- how the sphinx got to @entity0 -- it will likely remain a mystery
" maybe this was a gift which the @entity7 king sent to the local king of @entity0
to prove it ? impossible , " @entity21 said
@entity0 was the capital of the city of @entity79 4,000 years ago , its population reaching 20,000
located on the route connecting @entity7 and @entity83 , the city prospered
excavations first began in the 1950s , and it is now recognized as a @entity85 by @entity86
during most of the year , this remote part of @entity1 is quiet
but every summer , archeologists , students and volunteers descend on @entity0 to uncover how the ancients lived
the site has become important for biblical archeology , which aims to illuminate events in the @entity95

but the real goal is to use them to understand civilizations
" the documents we found at @entity0 tell us about the people , tell us about their names , about their culture , about their cult , about marriages , about divorces , about economies , " @entity21 says
" all these things we learned from out at @entity0
we did not just find mute stones
we have to make these stones speak
and that 's what we do
" but experts and volunteers say part of the rewards of working on the excavation is getting to know a different group of people -- those still living
@entity128 , a doctoral candidate in archeology at @entity24 , serves as a supervisor of volunteers over the summer
" there 's also a story behind every find
not just ancient humans , but also the volunteers that we have in the area , " she said
coming here is considered an experience of a lifetime , even though the work is hard and there is no pay
one of the volunteers , @entity148 , is not an archeologist but has been coming to @entity0 from @entity150 for 10 years
he is a self - described archeology junkie on a " workcation
" " you get to meet people from all over the world , " he said
" @entity1 's a great country
this site is really interesting
every year something new comes up
