-- @entity1 became the first team to be eliminated from the @entity3 in @entity4 after saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity6 , which made the @entity8 the first team to reach the second round following an earlier 1 - 0 victory over @entity11
african teams had held high hopes ahead of the first tournament to be held on the continent , but @entity1 are going home early after a second successive defeat and the hosts are also on the verge of exiting following wednesday 's 3 - 0 loss to @entity21
@entity1 took the lead through star striker @entity23 , but @entity6 rallied thanks to an inspirational performance from winger @entity26 , who made one goal and scored the winner
the @entity29 are top of @entity30 after two victories thanks to @entity33 's second - half winner in @entity34 , while @entity6 and @entity11 will determine the second team to reach the knockout stages when they clash on thursday , both having three points
@entity11 have a slightly better goal difference and can qualify with a draw
@entity6 2 - 1 @entity1 @entity1 star @entity23 has been one of the poster faces of the tournament , and he became the fourth player from his country to score at more than one @entity3 after being restored to his more customary central striking role by coach @entity45
the @entity46 forward punished the @entity48 defense after @entity49 inexplicably gave the ball away to @entity51 in the 10th minute in @entity52
the lead lasted just 23 minutes as @entity26 broke free down the right and delivered a superb low cross into the path of striker @entity57 , who slid the ball into the net
that triggered a frantic end to the half as @entity62 had a goalbound shot blocked by @entity1 midfielder @entity64 , who had given the ball away in the first place , then @entity23 hit the post after a similar chain of events at the other end and @entity70 ineffectually flicked the ball at @entity48 goalkeeper @entity71 when he should have scored
in the second half , @entity51 missed a chance to go ahead and @entity1 immediately went behind as @entity57 set up @entity26 on the counter-attack
the veteran winger cut inside a retreating @entity76 and curled in a left - foot effort , with @entity1 full - back @entity78 caught out of position in the other half
@entity6 should have added to that 61st - minute goal but captain @entity62 shot straight at goalkeeper @entity82 after clever play by @entity26 on 70
@entity1 kept pouring forward in a brave attempt to stay in the tournament , and @entity49 inadvertently made a crucial block with his face from a goalbound shot by 18 - year - old substitute @entity89 while @entity71 did well to deny @entity70 again
" we missed the required coolness in front of goal , " @entity45 told reporters
" we did n't finish very well , but i feel like we gave everything we could
" @entity6 coach @entity95 was not impressed by his team 's performance
" we made far too many elementary mistakes and i ca n't allow that from my players
we must correct that , " he said
" i was n't happy , but they fought heroically
some did n't play well , but they fought
" @entity8 1 - 0 @entity11 midfielder @entity33 scored the only goal at the @entity106 in the 53rd minute with a vicious , swerving shot that deceived @entity11 goalkeeper @entity108 , who could only palm the much - criticized @entity109 into his own net
the @entity29 , two - times losing finalists in soccer 's showpiece event , should have made it 2 - 0 late on in the game when substitute @entity118 -- who replaced @entity46 star @entity33 -- was denied by @entity108 after latching onto a through ball from @entity116
@entity11 , who created a number of half - chances throughout the match , had a good opportunity to equalize in the dying seconds of the game , but substitute @entity126 shot narrowly over the bar
the @entity8 , again missing injured star forward @entity128 , struggled to break down a tenacious @entity11 side much as they did in the first half against @entity6 before going on to win that match 2 - 0 thanks to a fortunate own - goal
@entity134 was closest to scoring when his spectacular overhead effort was blocked , while @entity11 's best chance -- despite several impressive attacking moves -- was a 38th - minute volley from @entity139 that was comfortably saved by @entity29 keeper @entity140
@entity11 's play assumed more urgency following @entity33 's thunderbolt , but they could not turn industrious forward play into any clear - cut chances to worry the @entity29 defense .
