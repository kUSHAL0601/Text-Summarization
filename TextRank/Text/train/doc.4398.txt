-- while most eyes will be on the likes of @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 at the @entity8 play this week , @entity2 teenager @entity1 will be making his own slice of history in @entity11
at the tender age of 17 years and 310 days , he will become the youngest player to line up at a @entity15 event as he surpasses @entity17 's @entity16 , who was 18 and 153 days old when he debuted in last year 's tournament
@entity1 , the @entity19 's 2010 rookie of the year , faces a tough task on wednesday against @entity23 @entity22 veteran @entity21 , at 44 the second - oldest player in the elite 64 - man field
but having finished tied for 36th in his only other @entity23 appearance at the masters last april , he is expected to hold his own against nine - time @entity28 winner @entity21 , the event 's 2001 champion
@entity1 has already won his first senior title , at the 2010 @entity27 , and his rise has impressed fellow young star @entity32 -- who reached the @entity34 quarterfinals as a 19 - year - old in 2009
" yeah , i played @entity1 this morning and it 's hard to believe he 's in this tournament as a 17 - year - old
it 's pretty incredible , really , " the @entity40 told the @entity28 website
" and there 's so many young guys coming through , all guys that are 21 and younger
it 's great for the game of golf , it makes it a little more exciting
" @entity32 is up against @entity23 @entity51 in the 16 - man @entity53 bracket , which also sees @entity55 's world @entity56 take on 19 - year - old @entity58 @entity57 , the @entity59 money leader
top - ranked @entity60 @entity6 plays @entity62 's 2007 winner @entity61 , like @entity63 in the @entity65 group along with @entity16 's match against @entity68 @entity67
world no. 4 @entity69 faces @entity72 @entity71 in the @entity74 bracket , where defending champion @entity75 takes on @entity23 @entity76
@entity5 is a three - time @entity77 champion but has not won the tournament since it moved to @entity80 's @entity79 in 2009
the @entity23 , who has dropped to third in the rankings after a winless past year , will play @entity84 's @entity83 in the @entity86 group , which also features two - time runner - up @entity87
the @entity60 , beaten in last year 's final by compatriot @entity75 , is drawn with @entity72 left - hander @entity89
@entity87 's conqueror in 2009 , @entity72 's two - time winner @entity90 , faces three - time major champion @entity92 of @entity93 in the same quarter of the field
each elimination match is played over 18 holes , with the winners progressing until sunday 's final -- which is worth $ 1.4 million to the champion , out of a total prize pool of $ 8.5 million .
