-- sandbag walls were beginning to rise tuesday across parts of the @entity3 against what the @entity4 warned could be record flooding in the @entity8 and @entity9 river valleys over the next week
widespread major flooding is expected in parts of southern @entity12 , southern @entity13 , @entity14 , western @entity15 , northern @entity16 and parts of @entity18 , said @entity19 , deputy for hydrologic services at the @entity4 's central region headquarters in @entity22 , @entity12
already , governors in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 have declared emergencies , as have local officials in several counties
@entity28 troops are on the job in @entity12 and @entity14 shoring up levees and stacking sandbags
@entity14 also sent 80 prison inmates to the southwestern part of the state , where record flooding was already reported in @entity36
illinois gov. @entity37 sent 125 members of the guard to @entity40 to assist the response in the southern part of the state
calls for volunteers to help with sandbagging efforts were going out across the region
@entity48 of @entity49 , @entity12 , was planning to head to the small community of @entity51 , @entity12 , with his church group tuesday night to help residents there fill and stack sandbags
" there 's a gas station and probably two , three dozen homes that will be under water tomorrow if something does n't change , " @entity48 said
" it 's basically just the simple fact that we 're told to help those in need , and if i was in that kind of situation i would hope someone would help me
" a levee in @entity71 , @entity12 , failed on tuesday , city and county officials said , sending water flooding into a rural but populated area of @entity77 , causing the evacuation of more than 6,000 people
people in the area were asked to leave " as soon as possible , " @entity77 sheriff 's detective @entity80 said
a levee protecting @entity84 , @entity12 , also failed , said @entity85 , public information officer for the @entity86
@entity84 schools let out early tuesday because buses will likely not be able to navigate flooded roads later in the day , @entity85 said
up to 1,200 people south and east of @entity84 faced possible evacuation later tuesday
the breach was 95 feet wide and 6 to 8 feet deep
about 25 to 30 residences in in the county were affected by the water and a dozen people have been rescued since monday , according to @entity85
a levee also failed in nearby @entity98 , @entity85 said
@entity12 's attorney general turned to a federal court tuesday to stop a federal plan to blow a levee to ease pressure on the flood - engorged @entity8
@entity105 , chief spokesman in the @entity109 ' @entity108 office , said the @entity110 is a " safety valve " in the current crisis affecting several states along the @entity8 and @entity9 rivers
in @entity117 , @entity15 , where forecasters are predicting the @entity9 will rise more than it has in at least 61 years , garbage collection was temporarily suspended because every available worker was installing floodgates before the @entity9 rises too high to contain
" we are putting all our resources on this catastrophe , " city engineer @entity120 said
crews were also working to build a steel barrier and extend a levee around the city 's convention center , which was at risk of being flooded
the @entity4 forecast the @entity9 at @entity117 to rise to 55 feet by may 3 , 16 feet above flood stage and two feet above the high water mark in 1950
@entity117 resident @entity132 , a @entity133 , said heavy rains and river water are already covering some streets , including the road she normally uses to drive her daughter to school
" it 's getting hard to get around , " she said
in @entity142 , @entity14 , flooding has forced some people from their homes in the city of @entity146 and other nearby communities
some residents have been evacuated
others are waiting to see what happens , said @entity151 , executive director of the @entity142 chapter of the @entity153
" there 's a lot of u-haul trailers sitting in driveways ready to go , people sitting on porches watching the waters rise , " she said
" of course , these are people who 've lived on the river for a long time so they 're used to that routine
" record or near - record floods are expected from @entity166 , @entity15 , to @entity167 , @entity13 , on the @entity9 and then south to @entity168 , @entity12 , downstream from the juncture of the @entity9 and @entity8 rivers , @entity19 said
if predictions are correct , the flooding could surpass records set in a mighty flood that inundated the region in 1937
the @entity4 said the @entity9 at @entity167 would crest at 61 feet on may 3 , 21 feet above flood stage and 18 inches higher than the 1937 mark
the @entity8 is forecast to top flood stage as far south as @entity179 , @entity180 , according to the agency
the @entity4 said snow melt from the upper @entity3 and rapid runoff from as much as a foot of rain in @entity8 and @entity9 river valley states is contributing to the flooding
three to 5 inches of additional rain expected in the next two days is built into the flooding forecast , @entity19 said
another bulge of water from melting snow is working its way down the @entity8 now , @entity19 said
the bulge , currently in @entity195 , will extend the flooding but is not expected to increase crest levels , she said
@entity198 , @entity16 , received 17 inches of rain between friday and midmorning tuesday
@entity71 , @entity12 , saw just shy of 13 inches
@entity16 ' @entity201 and @entity202 received more than 12 inches
the total for @entity204 , @entity13 , was 8.64 inches and @entity117 , @entity15 , was at 8.24 inches
@entity0 's @entity205 contributed to this report .
