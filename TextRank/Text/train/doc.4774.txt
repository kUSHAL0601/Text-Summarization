-- it 's not easy being a @entity2
the family of @entity4 and @entity5 , the alleged @entity7 bombers , have , like all their ethnic kin , led lives marked by violence and deportation
@entity12 is a small land in the @entity14 mountains that was one of the last places to be conquered by the @entity18 empire in the 19th century
in february 1944 , @entity20 added them to his list of " punished peoples , " whole ethnic groups who were deemed disloyal to the @entity25 and subjected to wholesale deportation
every @entity2 -- man , woman and child -- was packed into freight cars and shipped to the freezing steppe of @entity32
the republic of @entity12 was erased from the map
around a quarter of the 400,000 deported @entity2 died in the process
it was only 13 years later , after @entity20 's death , that they were miraculously forgiven and allowed to return home
but some , including members of the @entity5 family , stayed on in places like the republic of @entity46
fifty years later , in 1994 , the year after @entity5 was born , the @entity18 government unleashed a new wave of violence , sending in the army to crush a turbulent independence movement in @entity12
the @entity18 defense minister of the time predicted it all would be over in 24 hours
ten years later , after two savage wars , the @entity2 city of @entity56 was in ruins , tens of thousands of @entity2 were dead and many more in exile once again
from 2002 , @entity2 extremists began to wage terrorist acts against @entity18 civilian targets , most horrifically against a school in the town of @entity65 , where nearly 300 people were killed
the region is outwardly much more quiet now , but a low - level @entity69 insurgency continues in and around @entity12 that takes dozens of lives each year and is mostly out of the headlines
the two young @entity5 boys were the children of the war generation , displaced from their homeland , growing up as a reviled @entity19 minority
in their biographies we can see some typical characteristics of @entity2 life
where are @entity2 from ? not the @entity81 the first is the migrant life
maybe one - fifth of @entity12 's pre- 1994 population of 1 million has fled to different parts of the world , the vast majority of them to various @entity89 countries
a second is an aggressively macho culture
@entity12 has a warrior tradition and many @entity2 males and their fellow @entity19 from the @entity14 seek to compensate for discrimination by excelling in martial arts
@entity4 and @entity5 took up boxing and wrestling respectively
a third characteristic is that , as refugees from a misunderstood minority group associated with " terrorism , " they apparently found solace in the @entity105 internet , the multiplicity of devout or jihadist websites that linked them with similarly alienated @entity19 around the world
what makes these two different is that their alienation turned into a self - fulfilling prophecy
resentful of being labeled terrorists , they apparently turned to terrorism
what also differentiates the two brothers is that , unlike most @entity2 migrants , they ended up in the @entity121
most of the refugees who end up in this country see it as a safe haven
but in this case , a virulently anti-western streak appears to have followed the two into exile , or caught up with them here
opinion : what we know about @entity12 in @entity12 , @entity18 @entity135 suspicions fused with militant @entity105 rhetoric
@entity12 's first pro-independence president @entity56 ( or @entity138 ) @entity137 was a @entity25 general turned @entity2 nationalist who hated @entity140 as much as he did the government in @entity142
in the 1990s , at the height of @entity145 rapprochement , ordinary @entity2 blamed @entity146 for turning a blind eye to president @entity149 's war against them
more recently , the local warlord @entity150 , whom @entity142 has installed as leader of @entity12 , implausibly blames the @entity152 for backing the jihad against @entity18
members of a wandering wounded generation , the @entity154 seem to have been all - too - typical @entity2 in the tribulations of their lives , but one - offs in the way their journeys ended
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .
