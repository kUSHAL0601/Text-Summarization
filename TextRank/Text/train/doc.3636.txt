" university spokesman @entity33 said that the move to sell off the museum 's exhibits was " a very hard and painful decision " but a necessary one for the school 's survival
he said the decision , which calls for the museum to close in the summer , will not affect the university 's " commitment to the arts and the teaching of the arts
" the facility will become a fine arts teaching center with an exhibition gallery and studio space , he said
the museum 's collection includes iconic paintings by such luminaries of @entity57 art as @entity10 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62

the school has not undertaken a recent appraisal of the works , @entity33 said , adding that the process may take as much as two years to complete
@entity13 , founded in 1948 , is the only non-sectarian , @entity71 - sponsored university in the country .
