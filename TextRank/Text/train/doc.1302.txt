it 's no secret that a battle has boiled over in the @entity2
the fight has played out in the policy arena but also on the campaign trail
and since the inception of the tea party in 2009 , it seemed like that wing had the upper hand
it slowly made effective inroads into a party many members of the vocal new group thought had lost its way
they elected a new breed of @entity2 into office , including @entity20 sen. @entity19 and @entity22 sen. @entity21 , who surprised the political world by defeating establishment - backed candidates in their respective primaries
but those two successes have n't been the norm , especially in the @entity28 , as many inexperienced but ideologically more pure candidates have been unable to seal the deal
in 2010 , @entity31 won the @entity28 primary in @entity33 and @entity34 won in @entity35
two years later , @entity36 and @entity37 won in @entity38 and @entity39 respectively
all four went on to lose against the @entity40
in a year in which @entity2 have their best shot in several elections of regaining control of the @entity28 , party leaders are hoping to avoid general election stumbles
the @entity2 establishment is off to a good start this primary season , but it had an easy opener
@entity20 sen. @entity51 easily won his primary against tea party backed challenger rep. @entity54 , who was largely persona - non - grata during his campaign
still he spent $ 2.6 million in the final weeks leading up to the early march primary
@entity57 , a former @entity51 spokesman and former communications director for the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , which works to get @entity2 elected to the @entity28 , said @entity51 did the work necessary to beat a challenger , including researching possible opponents and raising money
" it 's not a coincidence that @entity51 won , " he said
@entity2 incumbents fight back @entity28 @entity2 want to make sure that what happened in @entity20 happens elsewhere
@entity68 leader @entity68 , who is facing a primary challenge from @entity70 , has taken the unusual step of publicly criticizing at least one group working to defeat some @entity2 incumbents , including @entity74 - the @entity75
" i think we are going to crush them everywhere , " referring to @entity75 - backed candidates
" i do n't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country , " he said in a recent interview with the @entity80
and in an interview with @entity86 , @entity74 said the organization is giving conservatism " a bad name
" " we know their business model is only to criticize @entity2 , " he said
@entity75 executive director @entity92 said in a statement to @entity94 that its members know that beating @entity74 " wo n't be easy
" but they 're working to elect @entity70 " because they know things wo n't change in @entity98 unless we change the people we send there
" while @entity74 's press office said he was talking specifically about the @entity75 , tea party groups took offense
" he must not want the @entity110 vote in the general election and that is why he should be removed , " @entity106 , the @entity107 chair , told @entity94 previously
and the local @entity114 group endorsed @entity70 last week
@entity74 is expected to win his primary , but he 's not making many friends among groups aligned with the tea party
@entity119 say they could be force in midterm elections incumbents at risk the @entity75 is not the only thorn in @entity2 incumbents ' side
in addition to the local and national tea party groups , @entity98 - based operations like @entity128 and @entity129 have vowed to make sure that @entity2 in name only ( @entity132 ) -- those viewed as not committed to their description of a limited government -- have to empty out their @entity98 offices after november
other @entity28 incumbents facing primaries include @entity142 sen. @entity141 and @entity144 's @entity143
in @entity143 's race , the conservative @entity128 published an op - ed this week in @entity146 in @entity144 calling him a " liberal " because , among other things , he voted to create the @entity148 in the 1970s
" why would his seventh term be any different from the last six ? " @entity128 president @entity150 , a former member of @entity151 who voted for the budget - busting expansion of @entity154 in 2003 , wrote in the opinion piece
@entity2 strategist @entity156 said that claim is ridiculous
" these guys are desperate and they are losing , so they are going to be using more and more language that is less and less rational , " he said
but @entity160 , editor of the @entity161 , said @entity143 could have problems against state sen. @entity163 , who will benefit from money and resources of the @entity128 and the @entity75
" if there 's going to be an incumbent whose defeated , @entity143 is the first name on the list , " @entity161 said
perhaps because @entity143 , who has served in the @entity28 for 42 years and won his last election with 61 % of the vote , does n't yet understand the strength of his opponent
" the tea party is something i do n't really know a lot about , " he said on local station wlox
but the @entity2 establishment is n't sitting on its hands and is even active in states like @entity144 and @entity142 where any @entity2 would most likely to win
" in the past , if it 's a red state , we 'd say ' we do n't need to pay attention to that , ' " said @entity181 , adding that incumbents are prepared this year
primary involvement and in primaries where there is no incumbent , the establishment is taking the calculated and unorthodox step of coalescing around favored candidates
while individual senators often endorse candidates , @entity181 said the organization took " a hands off " approach during the last two election cycles
this year , the organization is more engaged
what 's unclear , however , is exactly what resources the @entity59 is providing to preferred candidates
in @entity204 , candidate @entity203 is the establishment favorite against tea party and @entity129 - backed candidates
he held a fundraiser at @entity59 headquarters in @entity98 on monday
@entity74 attended as did a number of the 17 @entity2 senators who have endorsed him
@entity203 spokesman @entity213 said he ca n't speak about the role the @entity59 is playing in the race
" i do n't work for them and ca n't speak for " the @entity59 , @entity213 said
" until we clear the primary , we 've got to be respectful of the process
" asked if the @entity59 was getting involved in any primaries this year and if it could identify specific ways the group was helping , spokeswoman @entity220 said , " as we have said time and again , any @entity2 candidate running for @entity28 is free to use our building as a location for their fundraiser , " @entity220 wrote in an email
" this is all information that has been repeatedly reported
" if @entity203 ' does n't beat his opponents , @entity239 @entity238 and pastor @entity240 , in the may 6 primary , democrat @entity235 's path to reelection is thought to get a lot easier
a similar scenario is playing out in @entity244 where @entity246 sen. @entity245 is in danger of losing her seat in the state that president @entity250 lost by 12 points in 2012
conservative groups , including the @entity75 , endorsed @entity253 , a candidate who announced that he would not support @entity74 as @entity2 leader , over well - funded , establishment - preferred @entity2 @entity255
what changed @entity2 strategist @entity156 said @entity2 incumbents have learned their lesson from difficult losses in the past two election cycles
" i think @entity2 have recruited better candidates and incumbents are taking this seriously , " he said
the government shutdown over @entity266 funding was also a pivotal moment for the @entity2 as many in the @entity2 thought it was a pointless endeavor
after the shutdown ended , house speaker @entity270 said conservative groups like @entity129 , which advocated the shutdown strategy , have " lost all credibility
" and he said in january the shutdown strategy was a " predictable disaster
" the shutdown " hurt their standing and degraded some of the leverage they had , " @entity2 strategist and former @entity270 spokesman @entity277 said
" that leverage has now swung back toward @entity74 and @entity270
" lessons from @entity287 's special election some establishment candidates are receiving an added boost
the @entity290 , which usually does not get involved in primaries , decided that this year would be different
" our goal for 2014 is to protect and expand a pro-business majority in the @entity294 and advance our position in the @entity28
how do we accomplish that ? we 're going early , often , and local , " the chamber wrote on its website
the chamber has backed @entity74 and a series of other races that are seeing opposition from conservative groups
@entity156 said @entity74 has nothing to lose by going after groups like the @entity75 who , he said , make their money by being " professionally unhappy
" " these people have no desire to find common ground
nothing that @entity68 will do will make these groups happy , " @entity156 said .
