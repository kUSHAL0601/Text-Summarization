-- @entity1 of @entity2 claimed the first yellow jersey in the 99th edition of the @entity5 with a commanding victory in the opening prologue in @entity8
@entity9 champion @entity1 is a specialist against the clock and over a flat 6.4km course underlined his domination with a winning time of seven minutes 13.46 seconds
it left him seven seconds clear of the pre-race favorite for overall honors , @entity18 's @entity17 , with @entity20 @entity19 ( @entity21 ) in third place
@entity24 's @entity23 had edged out @entity19 by less than half a second to take the lead before @entity27 star @entity1 repeated his 2004 win in the @entity30 city with another powerhouse performance
it was a welcome return to form for @entity1 , who had struggled in the early part of this year and made little impression in the spring classics
i 'm really proud to have won here today eight years after my first tour victory in @entity8 , " @entity1 told @entity37
the globalization of the @entity5 " it has n't been the best season for me , but this really helps make amends
" despite his defeat , @entity23 is left well - placed after the opening exchanges , gaining nearly 10 seconds on reigning @entity5 champion @entity47 , whose @entity49 teammate @entity48 finished a promising fourth place
@entity52 champion @entity51 ( @entity53 ) finished one second adrift of @entity47 , the same time as @entity56 @entity55 , rated by many as the main rival to @entity23 and @entity47
but @entity59 of @entity60 , who finished third overall last year , lost nearly half a minute to @entity23 , coming home 135th at 38 seconds behind teammate @entity1
@entity64 's @entity63 , who took the world time trial title from @entity1 last year , was left to rue a puncture , having to change bike and still coming home just 23 seconds down
sunday 's first stage takes in 198km from @entity8 to @entity70 , with testing terrain likely to rule out the possibility of a bunch sprint .
