@entity64 headed a late consolation for @entity63 but they were unable to prevent @entity55 moving to withing three points of them
in earlier matches , @entity69 - chasing @entity28 were held to a 0 - 0 by a @entity49 side who played almost the entire second half with 10 men after @entity75 was dismissed for two bookings
and @entity47 were jeered off by their own fans after slumping 2 - 0 at home to @entity79 , their ninth defeat of the season .
