@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 will hold a general election on march 4 next year , the country 's @entity4 chairman @entity3 announced saturday
the vote will be the first since ethnic violence followed disputed elections four years ago and left more than 1,000 people dead and 350,000 displaced , according to the @entity1 @entity12
in that election , both @entity13 , the incumbent , and challenger @entity15 claimed to have won
the post-election chaos escalated into ethnic violence with members of the president 's tribe , the @entity20 , fighting members of @entity15 's @entity24 tribe and other groups
the two later entered into a power - sharing agreement , with @entity15 named prime minister and @entity13 named president
setting the date for new elections has been a contentious process
under the old constitution , the president had the power to dissolve parliament after which the electoral body would announce the election date
but under the new constitution , agreed in 2010 , the election date is already set -- it 's in august , every five years
however , because @entity1 is in a unique situation -- it has a coalition government following the 2007 disputed elections -- the president and prime minister have to agree on when to dissolve the coalition parliament to pave way for the electoral body to set an election date
this scenario generated ambiguity as to when the next general election would be held , which led a group of @entity1 to move to the high court
the court ruling gave two options
one was that the president and prime minister agree on a date to dissolve the coalition , allowing the election to be called
the second was to wait for the lapse of the current parliamentary term , which is january 14 , 2013 , and then hold the election within 60 days after that , as set out in the law
since the president and prime minister could not reach agreement , with the president favoring the second option and the prime minister keen to see a 2012 election , the @entity4 opted to take the second option
@entity15 's political party , the @entity72 , had urged the commission to set a date in december this year
the commission " should avoid any temptation of serving any sectarian interests through extension of the life of the coalition government , " the party said in a statement
a december date was the preferred option of the majority of the @entity1 people and would be in line with the high court ruling and a recommendation by the @entity91 , the party said
@entity1 will be keen to avoid any repeat of the violence that swept the country four years ago
in january , the @entity95 ruled that four @entity1 officials , including deputy prime minister @entity97 , will stand trial on human rights violations that are alleged to have occurred after the 2007 election
@entity97 and cabinet secretary @entity101 are accused of crimes against humanity
former agriculture minister @entity104 and radio journalist @entity105 face similar charges
the men named by the @entity95 come from opposite sides of the disputed 2007 election
