service had been restored by midday thursday for tens of thousands of @entity2 's u-verse tv , @entity3 and phone customers after an outage that lasted several days
" " u-verse service has been restored for all customers affected by the outage. , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity7 told @entity8 on thursday
" we know our customers count on their u-verse service , and we apologize for the inconvenience
" @entity7 said the outage hit " a limited number of customers " in the @entity16 , some of whom were without service since monday
the service has roughly 7.4 million subscribers
in all , fewer than 1 % of those customers experienced the outage , according to an earlier @entity2 statement
the outage was related to a software upgrade , @entity7 said , saying the problem was fixed by @entity2 engineers thursday morning
the service outage did not affect @entity2 's landline or wireless service subscribers
@entity32 reports on a discussion thread in the @entity2 forums spread from @entity35 to parts of @entity37
by thursday , many of them were reporting that service had returned
not that it prevented several from venting their frustration
" i just got an @entity2 ad in email that said how wonderful they are too , " wrote one subscriber from @entity45
my husband says we are canceling
there is no excuse for no service at all for 3 days , no explanation , and not even following through on the ones that you had appointments scheduled with ...
bad , bad , bad business
" @entity7 said that affected customers will receive a credit on their bills
the credits will appear within 30 to 60 days , she said
u-verse is a " triple play " bundle of cable tv , phone and internet services offered by @entity2
it was launched in 2006 and is available in 22 states .
