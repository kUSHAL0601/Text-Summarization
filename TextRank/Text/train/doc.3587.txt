-- screenwriter @entity1 has written some of the most famous lines in movie history
" my name is @entity9
prepare to die " from " @entity11
" " is it safe ? " from " @entity13
" " follow the money " from " all the president 's men
" " think ya used enough dynamite there , @entity20 ? " from " @entity21
" he 's won two @entity22 , two @entity23 , a @entity24 and a career achievement award from the @entity26
he obviously knows how to write
and he still has no idea why some of his dialogue manages to become part of the national vernacular
there are so many factors that go into creating a movie , he says , that it 's all a writer can do to get his script right
" when you 're doing a movie you have no idea who the powers on the movie are going to be , and is there going to be a star who wants this line or does n't like that line
you 're at the mercy of everybody and you do the best you can , " he says
" but you never know
" ( it 's no wonder that another of @entity52 's most famous lines is his summation of @entity54 : " nobody knows anything
" ) if you 're a screenwriter , it 's not exactly something you can plan
maybe the actor gives a line a poor spin ; maybe the director does n't capture the moment ; maybe the film editor changes the rhythm of the scene in the cutting room
it 's been said that nobody plans to make a bad film , but with so many variables at play , even a good script is n't bulletproof
great cast ! great director ! why did that movie flop ? @entity77 , editor of " the @entity78 " and several other books in the field , points out that movie quotations can be a shorthand -- something that brings up powerful associations
" some movie quotes become popular because they evoke a great film , or a great scene , or a great actor , " he says
" sometimes the words of the quote become proverbial -- something like ' the natives are restless ' or ' if you build it they will come ' or ' win one for the @entity96 ! ' they enter into the language
" he also notes that lines tend to get condensed or changed
for example , he was quick to point out that the correct quotation from " @entity101 " is " if you build it , he will come
" they 're also social glue
repeat a line from popular comedies such as " airplane ! " or " @entity110 and the @entity111 , " and you can immediately establish bonds with similarly minded individuals
this summer @entity116 fans have been fond of repeating , " i am @entity118
" the late @entity119 was a champ at composing such wisecracks , anti-establishment jokes that have been repeated by generations of viewers
during the @entity22 , @entity124 even promoted its " mini can " with a commercial that featured only well - known movie quotations
why that strategy ? " we want to take this to an emotional place , " @entity128 , @entity130 's vp - marketing for colas , told @entity133
@entity77 makes a distinction between popular quotations and catchphrases
the latter is more of a trademark , he says -- @entity144 's " what 's up , doc ? " , for example -- and incessantly repeated
they 're often even said in the voice of the performer
it 's hard to say " make my day " without evoking @entity151 's clenched - jaw delivery
these days , thanks to repeated television showings , video streaming and the @entity156 , quotations attach themselves to our craniums more quickly than ever
ironically , that means the person who wrote the immortal line is now more ignored than ever
think about @entity52 's classics : who do you think of , the actor or the writer ? " nobody cares about who the screenwriter is , " @entity1 says
" that 's one of the things you have to deal with if you write a screenplay
nobody has the least knowledge of what 's going to work , and everybody wants @entity178
