-- tension brewed wednesday between the @entity2 and @entity4 rebels after about 30 rebels detained 21 @entity2 peacekeepers and refused to let them go
the @entity2 , in turn , is demanding they be released
the rebels contend that the peacekeepers entered a @entity4 village near the @entity12 - occupied @entity11 , an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces
the rebels say they suspect the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy , which is defending the regime of president @entity22
the @entity2 confirmed the peacekeepers ' detention and explained that the peacekeepers were on a " regular supply mission
" the @entity2 offered no further details of that mission but said it is " dispatching a team to assess the situation and attempt a resolution
" @entity12 says it wo n't intervene in @entity4 - @entity2 incident there are two videos rebels posted on @entity36 that present the rebels ' point of view
in one , a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until @entity22 's forces withdraw from the village of @entity43 , where there has been heavy fighting
" we demand from @entity47 , @entity2 and the @entity48 to intervene and get @entity22 forces to withdraw , then we will release these detainees , " the rebels say
the other video shows rebels walking near several @entity2 trucks
" this @entity2 force entered @entity57 village to assist the regime ... and ( the @entity2 is ) claiming that they are here just to stop the clashing , " a rebel says
members of the @entity48 condemned the detainment and demanded the peacekeepers be released
the 21 peacekeepers are @entity64 , the @entity64 government said thursday
" the apprehension and illegal detention of the @entity64 peacekeepers are gross violations of international law , " foreign affairs secretary @entity66 said in a statement
the peacekeepers are reportedly unharmed , and negotiations are underway to secure their safe release , the @entity64 government said
the @entity76 said said it is coordinating efforts with the @entity2 ' peacekeeping agency
the rebels posted on @entity80 a letter to @entity2 secretary - general @entity82 and the leaders of the @entity84 and the @entity85
" what is happening ( is a ) genocide for the @entity4 people with the world watching and listening ( and ) will lead to the gravest consequences , " they wrote
" the blood of the people of @entity4 will be a curse on the whole world if there " is " no effective action , " it said
the letter pointed out that the city of @entity100 is under constant bombardment
there has been " hardly a @entity4 village spared from the regime bombing " the letter said
" this might be the last message to you , " it warns
" i call on you all to bear your international responsibilities before @entity112 and the people
" the letter is signed by @entity115 , the president of the @entity116 , an umbrella body of @entity119 rebels
opinion : @entity4 refugee crisis ' spiralling out of control ' deadly explosion hits rebel city @entity125 continued to plague the country this week , as @entity4 marked the second anniversary of the war
at least 62 people died across the nation wednesday
also on wednesday , a massive explosion ripped through the city of @entity134 , two days after rebels claim to have captured this provincial capital
" honestly , i cried when i saw the bodies
it 's the first time i witnessed such ugly images , " said @entity138 , a writer and resident of @entity134 who saw the aftermath of the mysterious blast
@entity138 , 50 , told @entity0 he saw 19 burned bodies at the scene of the blast
an uncut , six - and - a - half - minute amateur video of the immediate aftermath of the explosion showed panicked rebel fighters and civilians racing to pick up several wounded and apparently dead men
in the video , two middle - age men lay bleeding in the street next to scattered oranges and tomatoes that they appeared to have been carrying
smoke billowed in the distance from a burning car
the entire facade of a nearby three - story building appeared to have been blown off by the force of the blast
it 's not clear what caused the explosion , but supporters of the opposition were quick to blame the @entity4 government for the blast
" i thinks it 's the regime who killed those people , and that is because the regime wants to take revenge against @entity134 because that it 's the first province that was fully liberated , " @entity138 told @entity0
on tuesday , eyewitnesses told @entity0 residents were fleeing rebel - controlled @entity134 , as government war planes bombed targets in the city
