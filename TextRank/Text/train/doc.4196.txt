-- if you 're confused because your @entity2 is filled with women saying that they " like it on " the floor or the kitchen counter , you 're not alone
it 's all part of a new internet meme that has gone viral on @entity2 to raise awareness for breast cancer
first things first , though : these women are actually referring to where they like to place their purses , not to their favorite places to make love
of course , part of the reason this meme has gone viral is due to its heavy sexual connotations
the reason for all of these " i like it on " status updates is simple : october is @entity24 , and hundreds of thousands ( if not millions ) of women are using this meme as a rallying cry to raise awareness for cancer research
the status updates naturally get their friends to ask them about their commentary , which is exactly the point of this meme
like any social platform , @entity2 is susceptible to rapidly spreading memes
in january bra color status updates started dominating newsfeeds worldwide , again to raise awareness for breast cancer
while we do n't know where the campaign originated from , it 's cute , fun and generating some buzz ( especially useful , as the commenters point out , for getting women to go in for their medical examinations )
still , we ca n't forget that this is a disease that will kill 10 million women in the next 25 years , so we also implore you to donate to breast cancer research if you can
