-- even when a drone 's small , turned off , unarmed and resting on a table in a coffee shop , it can make people uneasy
that discomfort could change in the next few years as the airborne gadgets become commonplace and more people buy personal drones
startups are already popping up with different takes on design , uses and price
the latest aerial offering is the @entity15 by @entity16 , a midrange drone for photographers who do n't want to mess around with additional complicated technology
@entity21 and unremarkable - looking , the @entity15 is simple to put together -- just snap in the four propellers and two pieces of landing gear
it can hold a @entity26 , the drone photographer 's camera of choice because of its light weight , or other lightweight cameras and camcorders
" this is not designed to be a toy ; this is a tool for the average person to use , " said @entity33 , founder of @entity15 , who showed off his creation last week in , yes , a coffee shop in @entity36
the consumer drone market is still wide open for newcomers due to a combination of tangled @entity45 restrictions , high price tags , privacy concerns and a bad reputation
airborne photography is the most popular consumer use for drones , and the @entity53 line from @entity54 currently dominates that field
@entity16 wants to take on the slick white and red @entity53 drones with a slightly less expensive design and some quirky features
the @entity15 's landing gear can be pulled up in flight so that a camera is able to capture a true 360 - degree view without obstructions
pilots can control the device from a smartphone or tablet , pointing to any direction on a map to set a route
the apps can also control the camera position and track flight hours
when it 's not flying , the @entity15 is programmed to speak when turned on but not in the air
it spits out a mixture of warnings ( such as your gps is offline ) , explanations and casual chitchat in a @entity84 accent or voice of your choosing
" sometimes it has a little bit of a dry wit and sometimes it has more of a sarcastic sense of humor , " @entity33 said
the @entity45 is slowly working on clearing commercial unmanned aerial vehicles , or @entity93 , for use
( it 's expected to announce details by the end of this year
) last week , the agency issued an exemption that will allow a handful of tv and movie companies to capture aerial footage with drones , but regular people are still on a short leash
so to help consumers stay out of trouble , the @entity15 is also programmed to obey the law
amateur drone users ca n't go above 400 feet , and the devices ca n't be used for commercial purposes without express permission
@entity15 limits use of the device accordingly
like many @entity93 entrepreneurs , @entity33 comes from an aerospace background
he worked for @entity117 , the company that makes @entity118 , for six years
@entity16 now has seven employees , mostly aerospace engineers and one biomedical engineer
at its 800 - square - foot office in @entity123 , the company prints out drone prototypes on industrial - grade 3 - d printers and tests them in a 10 - by - 10 - foot cage
on wednesday , it kicked off an @entity128 campaign to get attention and funds for the first run of 1,000 drones
these early devices go for $ 480 to $ 1,200 and are scheduled to ship in early 2015
@entity33 said the @entity134 will cost between $ 800 and $ 1,700 when it becomes more widely available after the first run
the @entity15 is meant primarily for photographers , but @entity33 said he hopes to find other uses
" we 're working with a researcher who wants to create a metal detection halo
he wants to swarm these thing together to find landmines
" @entity143 reveals secret drone delivery tests
