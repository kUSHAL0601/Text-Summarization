@entity0 -- the illegal export of @entity5 military technology to @entity6 and @entity7 poses a growing threat , the @entity2 said thursday as it announced plans to combat the practice
@entity6 is the only country still flying the @entity11
the department said the @entity5 will tighten monitoring of export licenses and increase export restrictions on technologies that could have both civilian and military applications and could pose a danger to @entity5 national security in the hands of terrorists or potential enemies
" @entity7 and @entity6 pose particular @entity5 export control concerns , " the @entity2 said in a statement issued thursday
" recent prosecutions have highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology , military aircraft components , naval warship data , night vision equipment , and other restricted technology destined for @entity7 or @entity6
" representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly announce their plans at a @entity2 news conference thursday
officials plan to highlight two recent cases
in the past week a @entity39 company , @entity38 , was sentenced for lying about an illegal export of products that can be used in nuclear reactions and in the nose cones of ballistic missiles
the products ended up in @entity45 after being routed from the @entity46
in @entity48 , two men were charged last week with attempting to illegally export restricted components for @entity50 and @entity11 fighter jets
f - 14 components are widely sought by @entity6 , which is the only military in the world that still flies the jet
