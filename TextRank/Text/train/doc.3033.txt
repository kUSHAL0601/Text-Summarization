@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was standing in @entity4 when @entity0 mayor @entity5 called his cell phone
@entity5 was calling @entity3 to congratulate him and his students for taking first place at the @entity10 poetry competition july 20 - 23 in @entity4
@entity3 , a social studies teacher and spoken - word poet , founded @entity12 to provide a positive outlet for teens in his hometown
expressing loss , anger through ' slam ' poetry the four - day @entity10 festival and competition was created by @entity22 in 1998 after the inaugural youth speaks @entity24 in @entity4 -- the first poetry competition ( or slam ) dedicated to youth in the nation 's history
since then , @entity10 has grown to include youth from across the @entity31 and @entity32 , making it the largest ongoing spoken word event in the world
the @entity0 team almost did n't make it past the first round
dubbed the comeback kids by their mentors , they fought back from the bottom of each round , making it to the semifinals before sweeping the finals
" that call was confirmation that what they did was bigger than them , it was a reflection on the city that needed something positive from its youth , " said @entity3
" the mayor has been very good to @entity12 and has been very supportive
" the mayor did more than make a phone call
during the week leading up to the competition he invited the group to @entity60 , where he had a surprise for them : $ 5,000 from the city , $ 5,000 from the @entity64 and 20 round - trip airline tickets from @entity66
when young people step up to do the right thing , adults must step up to support them , @entity5 said
" these young people , expressing themselves creatively and positively , should be an inspiration to our entire city , " he said
" this sends a message to all young people in @entity0 that if you work hard , if you are positive , and if you are supported then there is nothing that you can not achieve
" long hours of preparation the close - knit group of @entity0 teens spent weeks preparing for the competition , often practicing six days a week for sometimes up to six hours
" it was their decision to put in this kind of work , it was n't mandated by us , " said @entity85 , a performance coach and poetry movement mentor
" we never had to push them because they did n't want to let anybody down
" @entity12 , Â­ a 5 - year - old nonprofit run entirely by volunteers , helps @entity0 youth discover the power of their voices through spoken word and literary expression
the students spend their saturdays throughout the year attending free writing workshops
there are monthly " slams , " regional performances and community service outings
the team returned to @entity0 with very little fanfare , and the students went right back to attending saturday writing workshops
catching the attention of news outlets was the latest flash mob to plague the city in recent months
flash mobs in the @entity0 are n't the singing and dancing kind uploaded to @entity120
instead , flash mobs in @entity0 are violent eruptions in which mobs of teens run through the streets attacking people and damaging property
over the weekend , @entity0 police arrested three juveniles and a 19 - year - old on charges of assault , reckless endangerment and robbery after a rampaging mob struck the @entity137 area , causing minor injuries to two people , according to police
" it 's very frustrating
while that 's going on we have kids who are waking up on saturday to go to a writing workshop , " @entity85 said
" it 's hard to keep telling my kids to keep doing well when the ones causing problems get the attention
" a safe outlet @entity152 is still in disbelief that her team won
she joined the team in january after meeting up with a friend at one of the group 's saturday writing workshops
" winning was n't on my mind , it was doing the best that we could , " said @entity152 , an incoming high school senior who performed the poem " @entity166 , " a social critique on the harassment of women , at the finals alongside teammate @entity168
" i have fallen in love with spoken word and do n't want to stop writing
" the group provides a safe place for personal growth for youth who might otherwise have gone unnoticed , she said , adding that it is disappointing to have flash mobs be the face of @entity0 youth
" most of the people in @entity12 do n't have a structured family , but it has n't made them worse people , " she said
" they would n't be out shooting or getting in trouble , they 'd be out there trying to survive
" visiting @entity4 was the farthest @entity191 has ever traveled from home
the group helped him find his voice , said @entity191 , a 19 - year - old plumber 's apprentice who graduated high school in june 2010
he joined the poetry group after hearing about it at an after - school poetry workshop hosted by his @entity202 class
" it 's a chance to show people what i can do on and off stage
i believe i have yet to reach my peak and i 'm not stopping here , " said @entity191 , whose mother died when he was 8
" we should be known for things other than playing sports or flash mobs
