-- ephemeral messaging apps such as @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , all of which advertise that your photo , message or update will only be accessible for a short period , are on the rise
@entity4 and @entity6 , for example , claim they permanently delete messages , photos and videos after 10 seconds
after that , there 's no record
this notion is especially popular with young people , and these apps are an antidote to sites such as @entity25 where everything you post lasts forever unless you take it down -- and taking it down is no guarantee that it is n't still available
these ephemeral apps are the first concerted push against the permanence of @entity34 conversation
we started losing ephemeral conversation when computers began to mediate our communications
computers naturally produce conversation records , and that data was often saved and archived
the powerful and famous -- from @entity42 back in 1987 to @entity43 in 2011 -- have been brought down by e-mails , texts , tweets and posts they thought private
lots of us have been embroiled in more personal embarrassments resulting from things we 've said either being saved for too long or shared too widely
people have reacted to this permanent nature of internet communications in ad hoc ways
we 've deleted our stuff where possible and asked others not to forward our writings without permission
" @entity65 scrubbing " is the term used to describe the deletion of @entity25 posts
sociologist @entity66 has written about teens who systematically delete every post they make on @entity25 soon after they make it
apps such as @entity5 just automate the process
and it turns out there 's a huge market in that
social media users migrating to smaller circles ephemeral conversation is easy to promise but hard to get right
in 2013 , researchers discovered that @entity4 does n't delete images as advertised ; it merely changes their names so they 're not easy to see
whether this is a problem for users depends on how technically savvy their adversaries are , but it illustrates the difficulty of making instant deletion actually work
the problem is that these new " ephemeral " conversations are n't really ephemeral the way a face - to - face unrecorded conversation would be
they 're not ephemeral like a conversation during a walk in a deserted woods used to be before the invention of cell phones and gps receivers
at best , the data is recorded , used , saved and then deliberately deleted
at worst , the ephemeral nature is faked
while the apps make the posts , texts or messages unavailable to users quickly , they probably do n't erase them off their systems immediately
they certainly do n't erase them from their backup tapes , if they end up there
the companies offering these apps might very well analyze their content and make that information available to advertisers
we do n't know how much metadata is saved
in @entity4 , users can see the metadata even though they ca n't see the content and what it 's used for
and if the government demanded copies of those conversations -- either through a secret @entity125 demand or a more normal legal process involving an employer or school -- the companies would have no choice but to hand them over
even worse , if the @entity132 or @entity125 demanded that @entity134 companies secretly store those conversations and not tell their users , breaking their promise of deletion , the companies would have no choice but to comply
that last bit is n't just paranoia
we know the @entity134 government has done this to companies large and small
@entity146 was a small secure e-mail service , with an encryption system designed so that even the company had no access to users ' e-mail
last year , the @entity125 presented it with a secret court order demanding that it turn over its master key , thereby compromising the security of every user
@entity146 shut down its service rather than comply , but that option is n't feasible for larger companies
in 2011 , @entity161 made some still - unknown changes to @entity163 to make @entity125 eavesdropping easier , but the security promises they advertised did n't change
this is one of the reasons president @entity168 's announcement that he will end one particular @entity125 collection program under one particular legal authority barely begins to solve the problem : the surveillance state is so robust that anything other than a major overhaul wo n't make a difference
of course , the typical @entity4 user does n't care whether the @entity134 government is monitoring his conversations
he 's more concerned about his high school friends and his parents
but if these platforms are insecure , it 's not just the @entity125 that one should worry about
dissidents in the @entity183 and elsewhere need security , and if they rely on ephemeral apps , they need to know that their own governments are n't saving copies of their chats
and even @entity134 high school students need to know that their photos wo n't be surreptitiously saved and used against them years later
the need for ephemeral conversation is n't some weird privacy fetish or the exclusive purview of criminals with something to hide
it represents a basic need for human privacy , and something every one of us had as a matter of course before the invention of microphones and recording devices
we need ephemeral apps , but we need credible assurances from the companies that they are actually secure and credible assurances from the government that they wo n't be subverted
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .
