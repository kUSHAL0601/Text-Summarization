@entity0 -- democrats and @entity3 squared off in the 50th annual @entity4 at @entity5 thursday night
unlike the midterm elections , the @entity3 never led in this one , falling to the @entity2 8 - 2 in front of more than 7,000 people
freshmen rep. @entity9 , @entity10 , shone on the mound for the @entity2 going five innings before giving up a hit
" we gained 87 seats in the last election , they gained three but one of theirs is a pitcher from @entity20 , @entity9 , who i do want to point out to mr. @entity9 that the @entity4 salary is $ 175,000
the @entity27 minimum salary $ 350,000 and i know the owner of the @entity29 and the @entity30 , " said @entity24 coach rep. @entity23 , @entity25
while @entity2 and @entity3 were adversaries on the field , @entity2 coach rep. @entity31 , @entity32 , says he hopes events like this can help make bipartisanship a little more likely on @entity38
" it gives us a chance to get to know one another and it helps a lot when you see someone on the floor that you played ball with , you have something else in common with them , " @entity31 said
" you 're going to give them the benefit of the doubt and be a little bit more civil
" it does , it honestly does help , " @entity23 said
" we spend a lot of time on the floor talking baseball ; that makes it easier when we do try to talk policy
" @entity62 played their first baseball game in 1909 with a few interruptions such as the @entity65 and @entity66 ticket proceeds from this year 's game raised more than $ 150,000 for the @entity69 and @entity70 .
