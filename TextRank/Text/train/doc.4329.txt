this coming season because of fears over security
@entity8 , in action against @entity7 last december , was hoping to play in the @entity3
stars from @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and , for the first time , @entity9 will be competing in the action that starts on april 10
several @entity2 stars had also signed for @entity3 franchises while another five , including leg - spinner @entity8 , were scheduled to appear at a players ' auction to be held in @entity23 , @entity7 , on thursday
however , the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) said players would not be allowed to play in the @entity3 this coming season on government advice
" we have informed the @entity3 and @entity7 board that our players ca n't take part in the @entity3 this year , " @entity24 chief operating officer @entity27 told reuters.com
the decision follows concerns for players ' safety because of the tense relations between @entity2 and @entity7 after the @entity38 militant attacks in november
former @entity2 captain @entity39 , who plays for @entity40 , said the players would abide by the directives of the government and @entity24
meanwhile , another former captain , @entity44 is among several top @entity2 players who have successfully challenged a domestic ban imposed following appearances in the unofficial @entity48 ( @entity48 )
@entity49 on monday suspended the 2007 action taken by the @entity24 which must appear in court later this month to explain their action
players affected by the 2007 ruling also include @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 who along with @entity44 , played for @entity59
last year , the @entity59 named after a @entity61 city and with a number of @entity61 players won the @entity48 20s @entity7 championship
" the honorable court has suspended this relevant clause of the @entity24 rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect , " @entity65 , the legal counsel for the players , told reuters.com
@entity74 coach @entity73 , a former @entity2 captain , said the suspension of the ban was good for @entity61 cricket
" some of the @entity48 players can still play for @entity2 and when they play in domestic cricket , youngsters will learn from them , " @entity73 commented
" the ban had hurt the players financially as well as cricket-wise , so it 's a great decision
