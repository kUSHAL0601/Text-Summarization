-- attention cruise passengers : you now have more protection when things go awry
on wednesday , @entity5 announced the adoption of a new passenger bill of rights
" the @entity12 codifies many longstanding practices of @entity5 members and goes beyond those to further inform cruise guests of the industry 's commitment to their comfort and care , " said @entity9 , president and ceo of @entity5 , in a statement
the new policy comes on the heels of a series of high - profile setbacks for the industry
from mechanical failures to a deadly accident off the coast of @entity29 , incidents in the past year - and - a - half have battered the industry 's reputation for safety
among passengers ' rights are an emergency power source in case of a main generator failure and a ship crew " properly trained " in emergency procedures
generator failure played a key role in the days - long stranding of the @entity43 in february after an engine fire knocked out power
in the case of the january 2012 @entity49 disaster off the coast of @entity29 , which killed 32 , many passengers recounted a chaotic evacuation of the sinking ship
another provision of the cruise industry rule mirrors the @entity55 's tarmac delay rule for airline passengers in giving cruise passengers the right to disembark a docked ship if adequate food , water and restroom facilities are not available onboard
the organization 's new policy also provides the right to emergency medical attention , timely information related to itinerary changes and mechanical problems and full or partial refunds for voyages that are canceled or ended early due to mechanical failures
the bill also assumes responsibility for passenger transportation and lodging in cases when mechanical issues cut voyages short
the full bill of rights will be published on each cruise line 's website , in addition to a toll - free number for passengers to call with questions about shipboard operations
the bill of rights is effective immediately for passengers who purchase cruises in @entity91 for any itinerary on @entity5 's more than two dozen @entity91 member cruise lines , which include carnival , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and others
the industry organization is also planning to request global recognition of the new policy from the @entity103 .
