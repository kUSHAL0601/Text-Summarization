-- @entity2 candidate @entity1 refused to say whether she voted for @entity3 in 2008 and 2012 , instead deflecting the question by insisting that her race " is n't about the president
" " i respect the sanctity of the ballot box and i know that members of this editorial board do as well , " she said
" i do n't think the president is on the ballot as much as @entity13 might want him to be
" some republicans were quick to notice the awkward moment and post the short clip to @entity17
she did , however , lend her support to another major @entity21 political figure : former president @entity22
" i think @entity23 know i 'm a @entity22 @entity24 through and through
" @entity22 , an active campaigner for @entity1 , is a decades - old friend of @entity1 father , the former chairman of the @entity26
@entity1 ' refusal to say whether she voted for @entity3 is the most recent in a series of attempts to distance herself with an unpopular president , who endures a meager 35 % job approval rating in the @entity32 , according to an october @entity34 poll
on her campaign website , @entity1 calls @entity3 's policies on coal " misguided , " arguing that his efforts " harm hard - working @entity23 and their families
" the energy - rich state is known for its coal industry , prompting @entity1 to release a " @entity46 plan " while other @entity21 , including the president , have bristled at @entity2 's sky high carbon emissions
and in september , the candidate made headlines when she wielded a shotgun in a campaign ad
" i 'm not @entity3 , " @entity1 , 35 , says in the ad
" i disagree with him on guns , coal and the @entity54
" @entity2 math seems impossible to some democrats
