-- it used to be billy clubs , fire hoses and snarling @entity5 shepherds
now it 's armored personnel carriers and flash - bang grenades
the weaponry has changed , but the target is still the same
if some of the photos from @entity13 last week were in black and white , you might confuse them with scenes from the 1950s south
white police officers beating black protestors
young black men lying face down in the street with police officers standing over them with assault rifles
we have a long history of aggressively policing communities of color in @entity27
police have treated black and brown people like the enemy for decades
in that context , the recent events in @entity13 in the wake of @entity34 's shooting come as no surprise
but they go way beyond @entity13
complete coverage of @entity13 shooting and protests what we 're witnessing is the militarization of policing , and it has become commonplace in towns across @entity27
every year , the @entity48 , @entity49 and justice funnel billions ' worth of dollars and military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies to help them amass arsenals of combat - ready weaponry , according to our report " @entity56 : the @entity57 of @entity58
" two of the armored vehicles patrolling @entity61 right now were purchased with these federal funds
an estimated 600 police departments have received @entity65 vehicles , which are tanks built to withstand armor - piercing roadside bombs
in the years since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 , this sort of federal funding has only become more available for state and local police departments
we 're told that part of the impetus for the federal agencies is to get rid of surplus military equipment
but that 's certainly not the whole reason
at least one third of the wartime weapons flowing to state and local police departments are brand new
the better explanation is that the militarization of state and local police is a deliberate strategy funded by the federal government to aggressively fight the failed " war on drugs
" as has always been true of the war on drugs , the battlegrounds are disproportionately in communities of color
this deliberate strategy explains why almost 80 % of the paramilitary raids we studied were to search homes ( usually for drugs ) ; why @entity97 teams forced their way into people 's homes using military equipment like battering rams 60 % of the time ; and why they were 14 times more likely to deploy flash - bang grenades , originally invented to ambush wartime enemies , in drug raids than during @entity97 raids for other purposes
and just has been true for decades , our police 's most aggressive tactics are doing disproportionate damage to communities of color
overall , 54 % of people impacted by the paramilitary searches were people of color
dumping weapons and equipment designed for overseas combat into local neighborhoods is only adding dangerous fuel to the fire of aggressive policing
it might be tempting to think that the brutal tactics we 've seen are the result of a few bad police officers
it might be comforting to think this is a fluke
and that might be partially true
but when the government arms cops like soldiers , trains them in counter-insurgency tactics , tells them they are fighting an enemy , we should expect this type of combustive , tragic result
but that does n't mean we should accept the status quo
we need to change it
it 's time for @entity145 to rein in its support for programs like the @entity148 's 1033 program that allows the @entity148 to dole out weapons and stop the @entity151 from handing out cash to police departments
cutting this funding is part of a larger recognition that aggressively fighting the war on drugs has failed to abate drug use and instead done incredible damage to communities
the federal government must recognize that the funding currently going toward this war can and should be spent on more effective interventions like drug and mental health treatment and housing
concurrently , state and local governments should constrain the ability of law enforcement to raid people 's homes and police neighborhoods using wartime weapons and tactics
part of the reason this has n't happened yet is that many people were simply unaware of how militarized our police have become
the events in @entity13 should dispel any illusions people may have about that
it 's time for the federal government to stop financing a siege on communities of color .
