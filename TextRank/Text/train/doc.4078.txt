@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's prime minister is in a world of political hurt right now
the latest poll numbers by the country 's largest daily newspaper , @entity7 , showed 24 percent of those polled approve of @entity11 's performance , a nine - point drop from a month earlier , while 67 percent disapprove of him
so when @entity11 recently opened the doors of his official residence to serve @entity1 barbeque to ordinary voters for an event called the " @entity18 , " his earnest effort to talk to ordinary citizens did n't grab the attention of critic @entity22 -- but his choice of clothing did
a multi-colored , throwback to the 1980s fashion disaster , @entity22 explained , as he noted the prime minister 's red , yellow , green , purple and blue - checked plaid shirt
the critic wrote a public condemnation about the shirt in a national magazine and warned the country that the multi-colored get - up represented what the poll numbers already show : @entity11 is out of touch
" this shirt comes from the ' 80s or ' 90s
his ideas and philosophy are old
@entity1 is facing a crisis and we ca n't overcome it with a prime minister like this
" it 's the latest crime in a long fashion rap sheet , said @entity22 , as he highlighted other multi-colored shirts , mauve coats , and what @entity22 calls the biggest faux pas -- the hearts and pink blazer outfit
on the day @entity22 spoke with @entity2 , he wore white - rimmed glasses , silver shoes and a small brimmed hat
" a fashion designer like me can wear this , but not the leader of @entity1 , " he said
@entity22 feels so strongly about @entity11 because the country felt passionately about the prime minister , who stormed into power last august in a historic wave of voter discontent
the @entity69 of @entity1 unseated the @entity70 , a ruling party that held power in the country for nearly 50 continuous years
in office , the prime minister and his wife have been a fascinating new sort of first couple for @entity1
mrs. @entity78 , a published author , had previously published a tale in which she wrote that she had lived a previous life and in it , met @entity83 actor @entity82
in another public admonition , she told a talk show that she gets energy by " eating the sun. " the prime minister , shortly after his election , became a radio sensation when an old song of his -- a lounge tune recorded decades ago called " @entity94 " -- hit the airwaves
in the early months , the country embraced the quirks of the @entity98
but then frustrating stalemates began to crop up in his administration -- primarily , criticism over @entity11 's handling of the move of a @entity83 base on the island of @entity107
those polled in @entity7 said he has been wishy - washy on finding a solution for the @entity111
the criticism of the shirt may seem catty and unimportant , but it 's a bad sign , said @entity114 , a government affairs consultant at @entity115
" as a politician , you want to have the focus on policy and your agenda
i think the press and the @entity1 people have lost patience with him ; patience to the extent that they 're no longer paying attention to his policy proposals because no one has faith in his ability to implement them
" " the press and the media are starting to nitpick on , really , things that are irrelevant to the future of the @entity1 people but i would expect that to continue
whether he 's not dressing properly , goes to the wrong restaurants , spends too much on dinner , what his wife is wearing
it goes from the politics of policy to the politics of personality
and that does n't help @entity1
" the poll numbers are not lost on the man who is the subject of the study
@entity11 told reporters : " i take it seriously that my approval ratings are down significantly
but i 'm not going to quit
