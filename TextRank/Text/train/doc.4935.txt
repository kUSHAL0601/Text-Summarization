-- the death rate from cancer in the @entity3 has dropped dramatically in the last two decades , according to a new report from the @entity5
@entity3 cancer death rates have risen consistently since the 1900s ; they peaked in 1991 at 215.1 deaths per 100,000 in the population
the 2009 death rate , which just became available , is 173.1 per 100,000
that 's a 20 % decline in cancer death rates from 1991
the report also includes grim news
the @entity5 estimates 1.6 million @entity3 will be diagnosed with cancer and more than 580,000 will die of cancer in 2013
as has been the case for decades , only cardiovascular disease will kill more @entity3
the report , released thursday , compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence , mortality and survival
it is based on data gathered by the @entity25 , the @entity26 , and the @entity27
the decline in deaths from 1991 to 2009 is clear evidence of progress in the fight against cancer
it is far more powerful than other statistics such as increasing survival rates or declining incidence rates
the 20 % decrease translates into the prevention of 1.18 million cancer deaths
in 2009 alone , nearly 153,000 cancer deaths were prevented
cancer now no. 1 killer of @entity3 hispanics there were declines in the death rates for a number of major cancers
@entity50 , colorectal , breast and prostate cancer make up nearly half of all cancers diagnosed in the @entity3
all four had greater than 30 % decreases in mortality rates
the single biggest reason for this good news is reduction in smoking rates
improvements in early detection and cancer treatment also contributed to the decline
analysis of the data tells us that we can do better
substantially more lives could be saved if existing methods of cancer prevention and treatment were practiced more widely
this is incredibly important as the @entity3 population increases in size and the proportion of older @entity3 grows
the leading cause of cancer in the @entity3 is smoking
more than one in five @entity3 still smoke
in some states , such as @entity81 and @entity82 , nearly 30 % of residents smoke
these states have the highest cancer death rates
in other states , such as @entity87 and @entity88 , smoking rates are as low as 10 %
these states have the lowest cancer death rates
the obesity epidemic is also affecting cancer rates in a very negative way
indeed , obesity is the second leading cause of cancer
more than a dozen cancers -- from breast and prostate cancer to pancreatic and colon cancer -- have been linked to @entity3 's epidemic of high caloric intake and lack of physical activity
while 15 % of adults were obese in 1970 , more than 35 % were obese in 2010
even more concerning , 4 % of children aged 6 to 11 were obese in 1970 ; 20 % of that group were obese in 2010
while overall there is a significant decline in cancer mortality , the obesity epidemic is continuing to push the cancer mortality rate upward
a substantial proportion of @entity3 do not receive the high - quality preventive and treatment services that experts agree people should get
more than a third of women over 50 are not getting routine breast cancer screening
nearly half of @entity3 over 50 are not getting colon cancer screening
these are interventions about which there is no controversy
value of mass prostate cancer screenings questioned even more unsettling , a substantial number of @entity3 diagnosed with cancer are unable to get adequate treatment
if we simply get adequate medical care to those who need it , more lives could be saved
