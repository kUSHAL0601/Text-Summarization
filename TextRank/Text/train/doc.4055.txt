-- the @entity2 sheriff known nationwide for his tough stance on undocumented immigrants says he has a mission now that he 's clinched another re-election victory : meeting with @entity8
" i would hope to get together with the @entity14 community , if i could ever have them talk to me without screaming and threatening me , " @entity10 sheriff @entity9 told supporters as election results came in tuesday night
" so i hope to get together with the community and try to explain what we do , so that 's going to be one of my missions coming up
" both the @entity22 and the @entity23 have filed lawsuits accusing @entity9 of civil rights violations and racial discrimination against @entity8
last december , the @entity23 said it had found cause to believe the sheriff 's office " has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the @entity30 and federal law " and , under the leadership of @entity9 , discriminated against @entity8 through traffic stops , detentions and arrests and against @entity14 inmates with limited @entity39 proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services
@entity9 has denied any discrimination or civil rights violations , and one of his attorneys called the @entity23 investigation a " witch hunt
" @entity9 cleared of financial improprieties on tuesday night , the sheriff said he has no intention of changing his policies in his sixth term
" i have a message for the president of the @entity55
he 's gone after me from the @entity58 , the @entity23 , the @entity56 , i can go on and on
but i will continue to enforce all the laws , including illegal immigration , " @entity9 told supporters
" the 80 - year - old sheriff , who has been in office for two decades , has fierce critics and staunch supporters
latino voters mobilized in an attempt to defeat him at the polls this year
meanwhile , @entity9 told supporters tuesday night , financial support for his campaign poured in from across the country
latinos a key part of new @entity77 majority @entity9 also gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents
another controversial program : @entity9 's " chain gangs , " including the world 's first - ever female and juvenile work gangs
rather than shy away from controversy , he has embraced it , touting his nickname of " @entity55 's @entity90 " on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation , costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece
he garnered 53 % of votes cast in this year 's election , and his chief opponent , democrat @entity96 , conceded as results showed @entity9 ahead by 88,000 votes
" @entity9 won , you have to accept it , " said @entity99 , a @entity100 analyst
" he said it very clearly that he was going to be the sheriff that enforces laws , and not who makes laws
" five things we learned on @entity110 but some @entity14 activists -- who had hoped @entity96 would unseat @entity9 -- were n't ready to give in yet
" the pledge to each person whose door we knocked on , the people that we registered in front of stores and apartment buildings , is that every one of their votes will be counted , " said @entity112 , director of @entity2 , an immigrant advocacy organization
@entity125 said many people voted on provisional ballots in the election , or cast absentee ballots that had yet to be counted by elections officials
her group estimates that more than 400,000 votes may have yet to be counted
the @entity2 secretary of state office said wednesday that there were 344,000 uncounted early votes in @entity10 and 115,000 provisional ballots yet to be verified there
other activists said that problems for immigrants go far beyond @entity10
" many people are happy that ( president @entity144 ) @entity144 won again and others are upset that @entity9 won , but we know that they both work together to deport members of our community , " said @entity140 , director of the @entity142 human rights organization
while authorities count provisional ballots , other opponents of the controversial sheriff are hoping that a federal judge will rule in the civil rights cases against the @entity2 sheriff and stop the sheriff from cracking down on undocumented immigrants
profile : ' @entity55 's toughest sheriff ' but @entity9 said tuesday night that he had no intention of leaving public life any time soon
" and by the way , for my critics out there , i 'm going to say right now , in january i 'm signing up for 2016
so i 'm not a lame duck , " he said
a crowd of supporters cheered
