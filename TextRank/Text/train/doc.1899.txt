-- this is a story about two brothers
they grew up in eastern @entity4 , joined the @entity5 and fought in @entity6 and @entity7 after the terrorist attacks of september 11
the brothers served valiantly , in the name of @entity12 freedom , to defend liberty and democracy abroad
they saw battle and bloodshed , bore witness to the loss of life and faced the unforgettable and haunting realities of war
the brothers returned to @entity12 emotionally shattered , psychologically distraught and forever changed
and the @entity23 failed to treat them
years later , like many of their comrades , these brothers , whose names we are keeping private , suffer from severe post-traumatic stress , anxiety , depression , physical disabilities and memory loss
one lives with severe head injuries because of the bombs that went off beside him in @entity39
the other was afraid to admit his suicidal thoughts
and when he finally did , the @entity23 locked him in a room for several torturous hours until they ultimately let him go -- without any treatment or assistance whatsoever
he was left alone to replay and relive the horrors of war
this is unacceptable and inexcusable
as the wife of a retired @entity52 commander and the representative of the district covering @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity4 , i see firsthand the permanent effects of war -- both physical and psychological -- on those who serve our country
nearly 30 % of today 's veterans return from war with some kind of service - related disability -- often ptsd or traumatic brain injury -- and too often , the @entity23 fails them
though recent reports highlight the fundamental inefficiencies and mismanagement within the agency , the @entity23 has failed to protect @entity12 's veterans for far too long
this is a serious problem , and it demands a serious solution
document : @entity23 audit report released this issue is about more than the resignation of secretary @entity81 ; it 's about changing the structure and culture that have pervaded the @entity23 for decades
the secretary is not the root of the problem ; he 's simply the face of it
we need to modernize an outdated agency , bring it into the 21st century and ensure that the @entity23 is better equipped to treat the health and psychological issues that are unique to our veterans
@entity81 apologizes , orders va fixes moreover , the culture of the @entity23 needs to change : right now , too many veterans feel as if the @entity23 treats them like a burden , leaving them both alone and untreated in the aftermath of war
we need to address the systemic , structural issues within the @entity23 -- the misallocation of resources , the interminably long waiting lists , the bureaucratic inefficiencies -- to ensure that our @entity12 heroes are properly protected the second they return home from war
the @entity108 has taken swift action to do just that
last week , we passed the overwhelmingly bipartisan @entity111 of 2014 , which holds the @entity23 accountable for actions that are both egregious and preventable
we urge the @entity113 to take immediate action on this legislation so we can get it to the president 's desk and signed into law
we can not afford to waste more time
with 23 deaths already attributed to delayed care -- and many more in which " delay in treatment " has been listed as a factor -- we refuse to let another veteran lose his or her life for something that can be prevented
when one joins the military , he or she is promised health care for life
so we need to make sure that happens
i am proud to join @entity137 chairman @entity136 , @entity138 , in his legislation to allow veterans to seek outside care from private practitioners , paid for by the department , if they have been waiting more than 30 days for an appointment
our veterans should be allowed to go to local doctors and hospitals to treat their physical conditions and rely on the va for issues that are unique to their specific needs
it 's time to bring the @entity23 into the 21st century with stricter management , greater accountability and better care
while the agency has done great things -- such as its innovative work with prosthetics for disabled veterans or its telehealth system in regions like @entity56 -- we need to take a closer look at the @entity23 's infrastructure , its strategic plan and its allocation of resources
the agency needs greater accountability and transparency
but most of all , the @entity23 needs to shift its priorities so the veteran is always the priority
we will fight to give veterans the care they deserve and were promised
we will fight to modernize the @entity23 to meet the needs of today 's service members
and we will fight for those two brothers in eastern @entity4 and for the millions of heroes just like them who have served @entity12 with unwavering resolve
they have protected us , and now we will protect them
join us on @entity185 / @entity184 .
