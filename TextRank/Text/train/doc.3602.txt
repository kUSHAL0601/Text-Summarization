-- less than a decade after @entity1 offered up " in rainbows " with a pay - what - you - want model , the group 's frontman , @entity5 , is now selling a surprise new album via @entity9
the record , " @entity11 , " is available now at the pay - gated cost of $ 6
a video for the album 's first track " a brain in a bottle , " which expands on the haunting vocals and glitchy electronic music of @entity5 's 2006 debut album " @entity21 , " is available for free
a link to buy the record on vinyl is also included
a step - by - step guide explains how to get the record
@entity1 , @entity27 with @entity28 the singer said in a joint statement with his @entity27 collaborator , producer @entity31 , that he hoped it would help regain control of file sharing
" it 's an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around , " they said
" if it works well , it could be an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work , enabling those people who make either music , video or any other kind of digital content to sell it themselves [ and ] bypassing the self - elected gatekeepers
" if it works , anyone can do this exactly as we have done , " @entity5 and @entity31 continued
" the torrent mechanism does not require any server uploading or hosting costs or ' cloud ' malarkey
it 's a self - contained embeddable shop front
the network not only carries the traffic , it also hosts the file
the file is in the network
" in this model , the music publisher covers transaction fees , while @entity9 takes 10 percent after that
the artist is then able to keep any data about its fans -- impressions , downloads , stream info , email addresses -- and they 're allowed to publish in any format
a @entity9 press release compares this to models where online distributors take 40 percent of payment and keep all associated info
earlier this week , @entity5 and @entity31 both posted a picture of a mysterious , unlabeled white vinyl , with fans speculating if it was for @entity5 's album or a new @entity1 project
