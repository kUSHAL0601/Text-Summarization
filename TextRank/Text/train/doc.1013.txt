@entity0 -- protesters will resist any efforts to remove them from the @entity6 park where they have been camped for nearly a month , despite mayor @entity8 's order that they vacate the park at 7 a.m. friday so it can be cleaned , an organizer said thursday
" come tomorrow morning , we will passively resist and make it as difficult a process to remove us as possible , " said @entity11 spokesman @entity10
" it 's not an occupation if you ca n't occupy the park
" his words appeared to be backed up by the sentiment of the crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who filled @entity21 thursday night
" all day ! all week ! occupy @entity11 ! " they chanted
@entity10 called the mayor 's announcement a " not - so - veiled attempt " to force protesters from the park , setting up a possible confrontation with authorities
protesters descended on the privately owned park near the @entity32 on september 17 to protest the nation 's ailing economy
" you want to clean up something ? clean up these crooks on @entity11 , " said city council member @entity37
@entity39 of @entity40 said he was planning to deliver to @entity41 more than 350,000 petitions and signatures he received thursday from supporters around the nation
" the mayor would do a lot better cleaning up @entity11 than cleaning up the plaza , " he said
" the park is clean , " said @entity49 , a councilwoman from @entity50
" the issue of cleanliness is a ruse , a disguise and nothing more than an excuse to end @entity11
" some protesters could be seen sweeping up debris
others said they have used donated funds to clean the park
a number of unions have pledged to support demonstrations cropping up in cities nationwide
@entity67 , president of @entity68 local 2110 , said members of her chapter planned to gather at the park at 7 a.m. , when the cleaning is scheduled to begin
" if the mayor thinks he 's going to evict these protesters and end these protests , he needs to know that @entity0 are watching , " @entity67 said
" the unions are going to be there tomorrow and are also watching
" @entity8 met wednesday with protesters and told them that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about " unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park
" " the mayor is a strong believer in the @entity93 and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest , " deputy mayor for @entity89 said in a written statement
but the situation in the park is " not in the best interests of the protesters , residents or the city , " he said
the cleaning is to be done in stages , and protesters will be allowed to return to the park as areas are cleaned if they obey the rules set forth by the owners , @entity109 , the statement said
" the park has not been cleaned in four weeks , a process that is normally undertaken every night , " @entity109 said thursday in a statement
" our goal is to keep the park clean , safe , and accessible to all
" a walk in the park thursday night found it in orderly shape
the only distinctive smell was an occasional waft of marijuana smoke
loads of cardboard boxes holding clothes and other personal belongings were neatly tied up in one area ; garbage bags were piled in garbage - collection areas ; a number of people were cleaning up
authorities have distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining a list of rules for protesters after the scheduled cleanup
the rules prohibit camping or pitching tents ; lying on the ground or on benches ; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground ; using bicycles , skateboards or skates ; and storing personal property that interferes with park use
@entity21 was built for the general public , but the weeks - long protest has raised concerns among area business owners and residents about sanitation
the protest campaign began in july with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit - in at the @entity32
for almost a month , demonstrations have addressed such issues as police brutality , union busting and the economy , the group said
organizers have taken inspiration from this year 's @entity172 protests that swept through @entity173 and the @entity174
crowds have taken up residence in the park in @entity0 's financial district , and organizers have called for 20,000 people to flood the area for a " few months
" @entity1 's @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .
