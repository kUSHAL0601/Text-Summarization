-- @entity1 did not mince words
@entity1 ( right ) wants musicians to have a sense of history and care for their craft
" i want to spend just a minute on a topic that never ever gets discussed in the music business -- the music , " the @entity8 guitarist and " @entity10 " star said in a speech to the @entity13 music and arts festival in march
" the reason nobody wants to talk about it is because it mostly sucks ! " who are we kidding here ? " he said
" nobody 's buying records ? because they suck ! " he called the speech " a @entity32 , " and implored listeners to get back to rock ' n ' roll 's roots
learn how to play cover songs , he said
harness your working - class energy
it 's been two months since that speech , and @entity1 is still passionate about the subject
" [ @entity43 ] is a craft that has to be learned , " he tells @entity0
" there are things you learn by listening to great records , copying heroes
" he believes that he said some things that people were thinking , but have n't said out loud
but the rumbles are out there
the music business is in a state of flux , with the sales of more profitable cds continuing to fall even as single downloads climb
" @entity59 's " season is coming to an end , with rock purists once again assailing the show 's slick pop sensibility
commercial radio , country , rap and hip - hop -- they all have their critics , many of them wishing a return to the way things used to be
blog : what do you think of the state of rock ' n ' roll ? @entity1 has sympathy for all sides , coming at the issue from what he calls " a unique perspective " -- he 's a musician , a dj ( with his radio show and @entity86 channel , " @entity87 " ) and record label honcho ( @entity89 )
he 's quick to observe that he 's not slamming all pop music
there 's vibrancy in some hip - hop , he says , and he admires " @entity59 , " particularly when it promotes music history
" but it 's quite an alien world to my traditional rock ' n ' roll world , " he adds
" it has nothing to do with it
" within that rock ' n ' roll world , he worries
today 's bands , he says , look down on performing covers , and as a result many have gotten lost in a musical wilderness
" the result is an extraordinary amount of mediocrity , " he says
" there are no standards to live up to
" which is part of the problem with rejuvenating rock ' n ' roll , says @entity112 , founder of @entity113 , which includes alt - rockers @entity114 and @entity116 among its acts
technology is one problem , he observes
" i think in the old days , in order to even be decent , it took a lot of work , " he says
" and today , relatively untalented and uncreative people can actually make rock ' n ' roll music that sounds kind of decent
and i think that kind of fools people and causes people to be lazy
" but for @entity112 there 's also a sense that the " square pegs " -- the naturally rebellious types -- are getting shoved in round holes
" a lot of opportunities inevitably these days go to people who fit the format , whether the format is top 40 radio or ' @entity59 ' or [ radio ] @entity140 or whatever it is , " he says
" there 's so much pressure to fit those slots
and it 's the square pegs ultimately who are going to change the world
" the spirited @entity112 wants to channel that rebellious energy
he 's high on a band he signed named @entity150 , a trio of 13 - year - old @entity153 girls who sound like the @entity154 with a touch of @entity156
" their attitude is maybe one size does n't fit all , " he says
" i feel like the spirit of rock ' n ' roll lives in those guys
... they 're having fun playing rock ' n ' roll
" @entity167 , the manager of the avant - pop band the @entity167 ( " @entity169 , " " do you realize ? ? " ) , is also hoping to foster creativity
he 's serving as the ceo of the @entity173 , a music school based at @entity174
drawing from a @entity177 concept , the school plans to offer courses in music , music production and the music business , many starting this fall
@entity182 observes record labels are n't spending as much money on developing talent
he hopes the @entity173 not only makes bands more signable , but also teaches them business strategies , such as setting up their own label and distribution apparatus
" this could become a think tank for how the industry could go , " he says , musing aloud
" people think of music as a throwaway cultural item [ nowadays ]
i want to change that
... make things more exciting
" technology , adds @entity200 executive @entity199 , can also be rock ' n ' roll 's friend
" the opportunities the digital world give the population as a whole to throw their talents to a very wide audience is a very good thing , " he says
more people have gotten the chance to put their music out there and connect with fellow music lovers , he says
of course , there are also old - fashioned connections
@entity200 sponsors dozens of showcases for new acts ; young bands play clubs and hawk their cds ( or web page )
@entity1 welcomes the efforts , but hopes there 's also a connection to rock ' n ' roll history
he 's founded a @entity227 to foster music education in schools
( to its credit , the @entity230 has similar programs
) " the spark comes from whatever people are into these days -- and that very well may be ' @entity59 , ' " he says
" you start with whatever singer you 're rooting for , and you start to trace back where they come from
it 's up to the artists themselves to make sure that their fans know where they 're coming from , to make it clear that music does n't fall off trees
