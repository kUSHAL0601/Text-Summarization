-- in case you 've avoided reading what may be the more depressing reports in the history of the natural world , the awful take - away is basically this : half the animals of planet earth have disappeared since 1970 , and much of it is the fault of humans
yep , you read that right
half of the world 's vertebrate animal populations are gone
and it happened in only the span of two generations , according the @entity20 , which was published on tuesday by the environmental group @entity21 , in collaboration with the @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25
" in other words , " the report says , " vertebrate species populations across the globe are , on average , about half the size they were 40 years ago
" ^ % & * ! that 's mind - blowingly infuriating
and it 's worse for some species and regions , in particular
the report overall considers 10,380 populations of 3,038 species of mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish , and says populations have declined by 52 % between 1970 and 2010
but for freshwater fish and other species , the drop is 76 %
and for for species in the @entity50 , which includes @entity51 and @entity52 , the decline is 83 %
@entity53 , director general of @entity21 , writes that , " this has to make us stop and think
" he 's correct , of course
but we ca n't stop at the thinking
we need prompt , dramatic action
the report says that we need @entity59 in order to " meet the demands humanity currently makes on nature
" that means we need to consume less , waste less , farm more efficiently , use water in a much smarter way and reduce our overall footprint
we need to stop chopping down forests and work to repair those that are gone
the majority of people now lives in cities ( 54 % , according to the @entity75 ) , which is a fine enough trend , but those cities need to become drastically smarter
sprawl must be left in the rear - view mirror of our former suvs
all that , and we must take swift action to curb carbon pollution
the massive rallies around the recent @entity86 climate summit should make that clear
" climate change has already been linked to the population decline and possible extinction of a number of amphibian species in the @entity50 and in @entity92 , " the @entity20 says
" in the @entity95 , the effects of a rapidly warming climate have been suggested as likely causes of decline in body condition and numbers in many polar bear and caribou populations
" this stuff is depressing , but the report does offer signs of hope
it relays a case study from @entity108 , for example , which started estimating the financial value of protecting ecological resources , particularly those along the coast
" @entity108 's coastal and ocean ecosystems provide services worth up to $ 559 million per year -- equivalent to 43 % of @entity119 , " the report says
facts like that make it clear why there 's a financial as well as moral incentive to protect our remaining natural resources
the authors cite wind farms in @entity130 as another success
" december 2013 marked a significant milestone , when wind power provided an equivalent of 57.4 % of @entity130 's electricity consumption -- the first time ever that wind power supplied more than half of a country 's electricity needs for a whole month
december 21 set another record , with wind turbines generating the equivalent of 102 % of @entity130 electricity consumption , " the authors write
i 'm glad those positive notes are included -- because there 's a real risk of reading too much doom and gloom into this report
i called up @entity151 , @entity152 professor of conservation ecology at @entity154 , and found he shares that point of view
@entity151 is an author of a study , published earlier this year , that found species are disappearing at a rate " 1,000 times faster than they should be , " as he put it
but things are n't as bad as the @entity21 report makes it sound , he said
" overall , there is no question that the status of biodiversity is going down -- that things are not improving , " he told me
" that said , i 'm not a fan of this @entity170
the reason is it sort of mixes up apples and oranges and lots of other fruit , too , for that manner
it 's a little difficult to unpack exactly what it means
there are many people in the media who assumed it means 50 % of species have gone extinct in the last 40 years -- and that 's not true
" instead , the report claims 50 % of some vertebrate populations have disappeared
but a single species could still exist with a smaller population size
assessing individual ecosystems and species is more useful , he said
the risk of considering so many species -- and so many types of data -- in a single report , @entity151 said , is that it can make action seem impossible
and , for him and others , that 's not the case
there 's much to be done
we can set aside protected habitats , put firm caps on carbon emissions , break up gangs that trade in illegal wildlife parts and continue to fund scientific exploration to ensure their safety and continued viability
@entity151 highlighted a number of conservation success stories , including the fact that @entity217 has reduced deforestation drastically in recent years -- and that the world has made strides in protecting ecosystems
the world has set targets to protect 17 % for " terrestrial and inland water " ecosystems , and 10 % for " coastal and marine areas
" we should move urgently in that direction
the point is that we know which direction to move in
it 's bad out there , but it 's sure not hopeless
we need to celebrate the species that remain -- from the penguin to the pangolin ( especially the pangolin ) -- and commit to a path of global economic development that embraces the intrinsic and economic value of the natural world
this report -- and a host of others -- should n't be a total downer
they should be read as a clarion call for action .
