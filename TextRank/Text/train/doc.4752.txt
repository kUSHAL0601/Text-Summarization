@entity0 , @entity1 -- flicking through her photos on her living room couch , @entity3 recounts the array of plastic surgery procedures she has undergone
" that is when i had my eye done again , a bump taken out of my nose , " she says , looking at a photo of her severely swollen face
there is n't much cosmetic surgery that this housewife from @entity17 in the @entity18 has not had done
a few years ago , feeling unhappy about the lines around her eyes and mouth , she first dabbled in surgery
she opted for a private clinic in the @entity18 , but after a bad experience there she started looking around for alternative places to get the work done
that 's when she first discovered that @entity1 offered the same procedures at a fraction of the cost , she says
" you get a lot of good surgeons and dentists in @entity1 , " says @entity32
" it 's like a holiday -- you are looked after , the weather is fine
" january is a good time to flee the @entity18 's winter weather , so @entity32 is heading back to @entity0 for more work
this time it 's a mini facelift and more liposuction
in total , she will have spent nearly $ 15,000 on surgery in @entity1
she says should would have spent a lot more if she had continued to be treated in the @entity18
in a suburb in northern @entity51 is running around trying to organize hospital visits for her clients staying in her guest house
she started her business , " surgeon and @entity62 , " back in 2000 and since then she has had people from all over the world , including @entity32 , come to her to facilitate their cosmetic procedures , and perhaps go on safari too

" like most companies , however , @entity77 and @entity62 was hit by the global financial crisis , particularly as a number of @entity82 's clients were borrowing money to afford their procedures
she says : " when there was a greater volume of people coming through then it was people who were borrowing money , for example , or using their credit cards to pay for the plastic surgery
so they were n't necessarily as educated or as financially secure , they were n't the typical baby boomer
" so when the economic recession came along , that was the first market that dropped away because , obviously , there was a credit crunch , so that 's the first thing you stop spending your money on , something like plastic surgery
" however , whilst the @entity69 and eurozone economies may have languished , @entity82 says she has benefited from the growth of some @entity71 countries ' economies
" there is a huge emergence of local @entity71 that chose to come to @entity1 for elective surgery , whether it be breast reduction , tummy tucks , lipo , " she says
" i would say one of the biggest countries is @entity114 , " she adds
" there is quite a big market coming out of @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 ... their economies are growing and therefore their middle classes are growing and therefore the need increases

in the three years that he has been a private cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon , he says that he has also seen an increase in clients flying in from parts of @entity134
" certainly we are seeing people from very high income groups , " says @entity128
" from a regional @entity71 point of view , countries such as @entity139 , @entity120 , the @entity140 , all play an important role where socio - economic factors all dictate that there are more and more people who can afford this kind of surgery and so we are seeing a larger amount of those people coming certainly to @entity0 for that kind of surgery
" see also : @entity1 bids to become call center capital these clients are very clear about what work they want done , says @entity128
" for instance , they would come to me and say ' i would like @entity161 's butt ' or ' i would like to look like @entity162 , ' and the obvious body features of those two individuals are curvaceous hips and thighs with an augmented or accentuated buttock
" other than that , i think more and more @entity71 women are conscious of what their lower bodies look like , so what their tummy looks like , so they would like tummy tuck procedures , for instance
" cosmetic surgery is n't new to @entity1 -- after all , in 2005 , the wife of the former @entity139 president @entity177 died after having liposuction in a @entity181 clinic
but @entity128 says that from what he is seeing this is no longer just the preserve of the super rich or political elites
" it is not a necessity it is a luxury , so i see the trend [ in having plastic surgery in ] the next five to 10 years increasing amongst people from the rest of @entity1 , " he says
for now , though , it 's people like @entity32 who are keeping @entity82 and @entity128 busy ; repeat customers are the norm in the area of elective surgeries , @entity82 says
but whilst @entity32 will be having her surgery in @entity1 , and will be recuperating in the sunshine , she has decided against going on safari
in fact , @entity82 says that these days most of her clients opt instead to spend the day on a different type of safari ; they choose to visit the nearby designer shops .
