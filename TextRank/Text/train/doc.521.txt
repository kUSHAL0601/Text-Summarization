-- a brutal @entity2 guerrilla group that terrorized @entity3 during the 1980s but pretty much disappeared when top leaders were captured in the 1990s is making a resurgence
police in @entity7 , @entity3 , carry coffins of officers killed in a november ambush by suspected @entity12 rebels
in the latest of several recent attacks by the @entity12 , known in @entity15 as the @entity12 , 14 government soldiers were killed in an ambush this month
it was , a @entity19 leader said afterward , " the strongest blow " against the government in quite a while
it also was not an isolated incident
" it 's like that horror movie , ' friday the 13th , ' " said @entity24 , president @entity25 's assistant secretary of state for inter-american affairs from 1989 to 1993
" you think you 've killed the beast , and the beast returns
" @entity19 declared war on the government in 1980 , carrying out bombings and assassinations that by official accounts killed more than 30,000 @entity3 during the next 20 years
another 30,000 @entity3 died at the hands of the government and paramilitary groups in the fight against the @entity19 , a government commission determined in 2003
in the countryside of central and southern @entity3 where the rebels were strongest , @entity19 waged an assassination campaign against government officials , the heads of state - owned farming collectives , business owners and even peasants who opposed the guerrillas
political rivals , including other marxists or leftists , were not immune either
@entity19 also conducted daring attacks in @entity7 , the capital
rebels blew up electrical transmission towers to cause citywide blackouts , bombed factories and set off explosives near government offices and inside the ruling party 's political headquarters
assassinations were carried out with seeming impunity on the streets of @entity7
" they terrorized @entity3 , " said @entity64 , a former @entity65 ambassador to @entity66 and the @entity68 's associate coordinator for counterterrorism from 1987 to 1989
in a sign of how desperate the situation had become , then - president @entity71 suspended the constitution in 1992
@entity3 officials now say @entity71 took the war against the @entity19 too far , and he was convicted this year of human rights abuses
a turning point came in september 1992 , when the government captured @entity19 leader @entity80 in a @entity7 apartment
authorities , who had been watching the apartment , found empty vials of psoriasis medicine in his garbage and knew they had found their man
@entity80 , a former university philosophy professor , was known to suffer from the skin ailment and had come into the city from his jungle hideout to seek treatment
the arrests of other top leaders in the 1990s seemed to ensure the demise of the group , which had split into two factions
@entity19 attacks continued sporadically , but the guerrillas seemed destined for the back pages of history , as their numbers and effectiveness diminished
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , @entity19 was believed to have about 5,000 guerrillas
by 2002 , analysts estimated that the group had about 200 members
but @entity19 , which always had worked closely with many of @entity3 's estimated 300,000 coca growers and drug traffickers , was far from dead
in the early part of this decade , the @entity68 and others warned of a possible resurgence
that warning appears to have come to fruition
perhaps most famously , @entity19 set off a bomb outside the @entity119 in @entity7 in march 2002 , a few days before president @entity117 was to visit
nine people died and 30 were injured
in a june 2003 attack on a jungle labor camp , rebels took about 70 workers hostage and demanded a large ransom
the workers were recovered safely , but there were conflicting reports on whether a ransom was paid
" i 've been watching them reappear now with a sense of dread ... like dying embers that have been brought back to life , " said retired four - star army gen. @entity130 , who was drug policy director for president @entity131
@entity137 , a senior fellow at the @entity138 and director of its @entity140 , said , " the left - wing terrorists are still alive and kicking
" @entity24 , the former assistant secretary of state , said he wonders whether @entity19 is as strong as it was 20 years ago
" it 's unclear whether this is just a localized version of @entity19 or a movement that has some legs , " he said
nonetheless , he added , the situation is " worrisome
" although @entity19 was never popular with @entity3 , @entity137 sees an ideological bent to the resurgence
" you can arrest someone , " he said
" you can kill someone
but you ca n't kill an idea
" and that idea , @entity137 , @entity24 and others say , has its roots in poor economic conditions and the lack of social justice
" the mission that @entity19 tried to communicate for a very long time is back there because circumstances changed
the circumstances are right for striking for social and economic reasons , " @entity137 said , adding , " i was surprised it did n't happen before
" @entity130 in large part blames the @entity3 government
" the problem is the country does n't work very well , " he said
" eighty - five percent of the people are living in rudimentary conditions
they look at their government and say
' there 's no justice here
' " @entity19 's renewed life , @entity130 said , " is a comment on the incompetence , the goofiness of the @entity3 government
" @entity24 sees a " resurgence of the left in @entity184 partly because of the economic crisis
" at the heart of @entity19 's power lies its alliance with @entity3 's drug trade , which often pays the guerrillas for security , intelligence and logistics
@entity195 guerrillas in @entity196 known as the @entity197 have struck a similar alliance with that country 's narcotraffickers
@entity130 calls it " a convergence between terrorism and crime
" the drug trade in @entity3 , he said , " produces a mountain of cash , and @entity19 will exploit that
" @entity24 reiterated a point that @entity65 officials have made before : the war on drugs can not be separated from the fight against terrorism
" it just shows why fighting drugs is n't just about fighting drugs , " @entity24 said
" it 's about combating forces of violence that are attacking democracy
" and he and others said the @entity19 has been allowed to get back in the game because the @entity65 was not paying much attention , distracted in part by the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and the wars in @entity228 and @entity229
" this shows why we have to continue to pay attention and be involved in @entity184 in a strong way , " @entity24 said
@entity137 said , " this is a forgotten continent from the point of view of @entity65 policy
it has fallen through the cracks
