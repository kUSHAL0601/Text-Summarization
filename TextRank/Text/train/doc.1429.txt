-- nearly a month after false rumors on @entity2 about school attacks caused car crashes when parents panicked on the streets of @entity7 , @entity8 , state lawmakers there approved new regulations tuesday making disturbing the peace a crime
the new law could mean that imprisoned suspects previously accused of " terrorism " for their online posts could face significantly less time behind bars
now , those convicted of disturbing the peace could face up to four years in prison
state laws allow for a punishment of up to 30 years in prison for those convicted of terrorism
authorities say two suspects are behind false statements on @entity2 and @entity30 that fueled a chaotic scene in the @entity8 port city of @entity7 last month
one post claimed that five children were kidnapped
another described a helicopter was firing gunshots at an elementary school
i think that the children should be in their homes
go get them , " another post warned
gov. @entity46 initially accused those behind the messages of " terrorism
" but he proposed the new regulations amid a firestorm of criticism from activists and human rights groups , who said the terrorism accusation -- and the possible punishment -- did n't fit the crime
in a debate in the state 's congress tuesday , opposition lawmakers called on @entity46 to retract the initiative , arguing that the document was designed to help two people but could have a much broader impact
a lawyer representing suspects @entity67 and @entity69 said his clients would not use the new provision in @entity7 state 's penal code to defend themselves
instead , attorney @entity74 said he planned to make the case that they should be set free before a federal judge at a hearing friday .
