as @entity1 started three days of national mourning wednesday , the @entity0 said they targeted a school that mostly admits soldiers ' children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers ' footsteps and target militants
terrorists ambushed the school in @entity12 on tuesday , explosives strapped to their bodies , and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams
they sprayed bullets rapidly , killing 145 people
of those , 132 were children , authorities said
in an email , the terror group warned @entity25 to avoid places with military ties , saying it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas
it accused the students at the army school of " following the path of their fathers and brothers to take part in the fight against the tribesmen " nationwide
the @entity43 and @entity44 is home to about 1,100 students and staff , most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around @entity12
the public school admits children whose parents are in the military , but its classes are not restricted to future soldiers
a day after the massacre , @entity1 prime minister @entity56 lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terrorism cases
who are the @entity1 @entity0 ? ' under the benches ... kill them ' student @entity64 , 14 , recalled the moment the terrorists struck
he was in the auditorium when about five people burst in through a back door and started firing
" ' @entity70 is great , ' " the militants shouted as they roared through the hallways , @entity64 said
they sought out terrified children
" ' a lot of the children are under the benches , ' " a @entity1 @entity0 member said , according to @entity64
' " the ninth - grader got shot in his left shoulder and lay under a bench
" my shoulder was peeking out of the bench , " @entity64 recalled
" they went into another room , ( and when ) i ran to the exit , i fell
" seventh - grader @entity88 said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted
he fell into bushes before running to the school 's gates to safety
students , teachers recount the horror they saw children drenched in blood @entity1 troops eventually pushed through the buildings , room by room , and confined the attackers to four buildings
they found children drenched in blood
some of the bodies lay on top of others
" even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror , " said @entity112 , the defense minister
" the smaller the coffin , the heavier it is to carry
" by the time the siege ended in the evening , military officials said all seven militants were dead
it 's unclear whether they were killed by soldiers or they detonated their explosives
the casualty tolls do n't include the terrorists
the ambush at @entity43 and @entity44 left more than 100 injured , many with gunshot wounds , according to @entity130 , a spokesman for @entity132 province
it started with a ruse the nightmare began in late morning , when a car exploded behind the school
@entity1 authorities said the blast was a ruse to divert security guards ' attention
gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades eight , nine and 10 have classes
the militants came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive , a @entity1 military official said
most of those killed were between the ages of 12 and 16 , said @entity156 , chief minister of @entity132 province , of which @entity12 is the capital
some adults were also targeted , including a 28 - year - old office assistant who was shot and burned alive , police official @entity159 said
goal was to kill @entity1 authorities said the attackers ' goal was to kill , not take captives
while lifting a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases , the prime minister expressed frustration about failed talks
" we tried dialogue with these militants , we reopened the door to talks , " @entity56 said
" it was unsuccessful ... there was no other option than to engage in an operation against these people
" he did not mention any specific terror groups
but the @entity1 @entity0 and the government have been involved in peace talks in the past
@entity1 released 19 @entity0 noncombatants in a goodwill gesture , but talks broke down after a wave of militant attacks
violent past @entity1 has seen plenty of violence , much of it involving militants targeting restive regions in northwest @entity1 along the border with @entity196
it is the home base of the @entity1 @entity0 , known as the @entity198 e @entity0 @entity1 or @entity199 , which seeks to enforce its conservative version of @entity201 in @entity1
the group has battled @entity1 troops and attacked civilians , including in @entity12 , an ancient city of more than 3 million people
and the @entity0 have n't hesitated to go after schoolchildren
their most notable target is @entity208 , who was singled out and shot in october 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls
the teenage girl survived and became the youngest recipient of the @entity214 last week for her efforts to promote education and girls ' rights
@entity208 said the attack left her heartbroken
" innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this , " she said
@entity196 @entity0 slam @entity1 counterparts this is the deadliest incident inside @entity1 since october 2007 , when 139 @entity1 died and more than 250 others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former @entity1 prime minister @entity231 , according to the @entity233 's @entity232
even the @entity0 in @entity196 , who are closely affiliated with their @entity1 counterparts , criticized the killing of women and children as against @entity201 teaching
the spokesman for the @entity196 terror group expressed condolences to the victims of tuesday 's attack .
