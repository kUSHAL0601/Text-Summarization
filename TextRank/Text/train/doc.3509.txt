@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 is the scene of another night of protests in @entity1 , with demonstrators calling for a government more responsive to @entity1 ' needs
protests have been staged in major cities across the country , but @entity0 was the focal point of tuesday 's marches
the thousands who gathered were mostly peaceful , and the atmosphere was almost festive
but at least one small group unsuccessfully tried to force their way into a municipal building
police for the most part stood back , but repelled those who tried to enter the government building by bashing its windows with police barriers
@entity1 say they are angry about high taxes , corruption , and lavish spending on the upcoming @entity29 soccer tournament , among other complaints
protests on monday were the largest in the country in at least 20 years
president @entity33 said tuesday their message was being heard
" the direct message from the streets is for more citizenship , better schools , better hospitals , better health , for direct participation , " she said in a nationally televised address
" my government is trying and committed to social transformation
" the feeling among the protesters is that they are paying into a system that is not giving them back enough in return
" it 's all about national priorities , " said @entity51 , a @entity2 ireporter who participated in protests in @entity53
" we want health , we want education
" brazilians like himself find themselves asking how the government is using their taxes for its citizens , while watching as millions are spent on preparations for the @entity29 and the 2016 @entity66
" people ca n't take it anymore , " he said
thousands protest over rising costs of @entity29 while praising the largely peaceful protests , @entity33 said that what she characterized as " isolated and minor acts of violence " should be confronted " with vigor
" government officials say they recognize the protester 's freedom of expression , but that there is a lack of a unified message from the demonstrators
the country 's investment for the @entity29 and @entity66 includes money for health and public transportation projects that address some of the protesters ' concerns , deputy sports minister @entity85 said
" there is absolutely nothing contradictory between organizing a @entity29 and investing in health and education , " he said
are you there ? share photos or video , but stay safe the protests are being organized largely by university students and a group called the @entity104 , which wants public transportation to be free of charge
the protests follow a week of smaller demonstrations that began in response to plans to increase fares for @entity1 's public transportation system , from 3 to 3.20 reais ( $ 1.38 to $ 1.47 ) , but have broadened into wider protests over economic and social issues plaguing the country
protesters say they are angry about , among other things , government decisions to spend money on the @entity29 and other projects instead of improving health care , education and other social programs
@entity1 is building stadiums and revamping its infrastructure ahead of the @entity29 and the 2016 @entity66 , events that will put the world 's focus on the @entity130 nation of 201 million people
what 's really behind the @entity1 riots ? the protests have attracted international attention , and the office of the @entity137 urged @entity1 authorities tuesday to show restraint in handling protesters
last week , at least 100 people were injured and 120 arrested after violent clashes between police and protesters in @entity0
police used rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters and journalists , bringing complaints of brutality and targeting of media covering the events
