but the row continued at the medal ceremony as he only grudgingly mounted the podium and after receiving his medal made a point of taking it off and leaving it in the center of the competition mat. @entity2 fans in the arena disagreed strongly with the original decision , jeering the judges , while coach @entity37 also weighed in
" it 's all politics , " he said
the medal was later returned to the sport 's governing body
