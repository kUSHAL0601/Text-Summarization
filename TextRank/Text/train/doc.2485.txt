-- leadership is one of those nebulous terms -- you hear it all the time but it has various definitions
the traits that make up a good leader can vary depending on the organization , team , manager and work environment
leadership can also vary in style -- are you someone who dictates the group and does n't listen to anyone else 's opinion ? or do you lead with a more bureaucratic or democratic style ? " every leader has a particular style of leadership that is innate
however , the behaviors , attitudes or methods of delivery that are effective for one staff member may in fact be counterproductive for another , " says @entity21 , account supervisor , @entity22 , a public relations firm
" great leaders are aware of their own style and make the effort to learn how their style actually comes across to their team
they learn to flex their leadership style to individual team members so that they communicate and behave in ways that motivate and inspire
" here is what five leadership professionals consider to be traits that make up a good leader : @entity44 , vice president of media relations , @entity46 , a public relations agency 1
always do the honest thing
it makes employees feel like they know where they stand with you at all times
know where you 're going and have a strong stated mission to lead people on
if you 're not sure , how can your people be sure ? you have to have strong focus and stay the course
whatever it is , you must have passion for what you 're doing
live , breathe , eat and sleep your mission
not playing favorites with people and treating all people -- no matter what station in life , what class or what rank in the org chart -- the same
people have to believe in you and your credibility
image is everything and the belief people have in you , your product , your mission , your facts or your reputation are key to being a great leader
you have to persuade people of this -- it does n't just happen

if you do n't believe in yourself , no one will
i hear leaders worrying that if they show too much confidence , others will think them arrogant
the reality is people want to know what you know for sure -- and what you do n't
having the confidence to say " i do n't know " is a powerful skill
the only way you can get confidence is by becoming really , really clear about who you are and what is most important to you
new leaders fail when they try to become all things to all people , or try to do too much out of their area of excellence
clarity helps you say " yes " to the right things -- and " no " to others
the strongest , most effective leaders i 've met care not just about the business , but about the people in it and the people impacted by it
plus , they show they care through their words and actions , even proving how they care for themselves and their family by taking unplugged vacations and continuing their own professional development
care should n't be a four - letter word in our workplace today -- and the best leaders know it
@entity142 , co-founder , @entity143 , a recruitment firm 1
they are people who are respected and worth listening to
i find in general due to all of the economic difficulties , employees prioritize and seek leaders and organizations that are honest and meet their commitments
too many leaders these days manage with the balance sheet , often times at the expense of their employees and long - term customer relationships
talented people want to work for leaders and organizations that truly care about their employees and the communities in which they operate
people produce real business gains and smart people need to understand what is needed and be part of the solution
great business leaders are able to get all members of their teams engaged
they do this by offering them challenge , seeking their ideas and contributions and providing them with recognition for their contributions
in today 's work environment , people are working very long hours and they need to take some time to celebrate their successes in order to recharge their batteries
those leaders who fail to do this create burnout environment overtime

true leaders have confidence but realize the point at which it becomes hubris
true leaders make their associates feel emboldened and powerful , not diminished and powerless
true leaders solicit input and feedback from those around them so that everyone feels part of the process
true leaders share their vision or strategy often with those around them
true leaders are not afraid to take risks or make mistakes
true leaders make mistakes born from risk

you need to be clear on what your values are and must be consistent in applying them
as part of that , you need to have the courage to hold true to them
you must not lose sight of reality
lost values may be one of the biggest causes of downfalls
you need to be clear on what your strengths are and what complementary strengths you need from others
this includes understanding others and learning how best to utilize their strengths
many unsophisticated leaders think everyone should be like them ; that too can cause their downfall
they surround themselves with people like them
" group think " can blindside them and cause failure
part of awareness is do n't expect people to change
if you think you can change someone , think again
this does n't mean you ca n't help them grow and develop
but do n't expect to change anyone ( even yourself ) behaviorally
we are who we are
your job as a leader is to understand each person 's strengths and place them in positions where they can flourish and grow
if you are good at that , you have a huge part of the equation for success
going from individual contributor to supervisor is only the first of many transitions along the leadership pipeline
you need to understand the business model , how it applies to your current position , what you need to do to provide the greatest value , and how to leverage your strengths at this level
this requires building competencies and focusing on the right things
no one ever tells you that there are many levels and many adjustments you need to make along the way
you need to foster a positive environment that allows your team to flourish
also by aligning the reward and recognition systems that best match your teams profile and deliver results
