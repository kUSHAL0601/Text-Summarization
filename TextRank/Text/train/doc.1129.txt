-- @entity3 's @entity2 dream is over after the soccer star revealed he has not been included in the @entity6 squad for the forthcoming games in his home @entity7
coach @entity9 has left the @entity11 midfielder out of his squad for the 16 - team football competition , rejecting the chance to include the 37 - year - old midfielder as one of his three players over the age of 23
" everyone knows how much playing for my country has always meant to me , so i would have been honored to have been part of this unique @entity25 squad , " @entity3 said in a statement released via his representatives
" naturally i am very disappointed but there will be no bigger supporter of the team than me and like everyone , i will be hoping they can win the gold
" should @entity3 be in @entity33 's @entity2 squad ? @entity3 was part of @entity36 's team which convinced the @entity37 to grant @entity38 the right to host the @entity2 for a third time in 2005
the former @entity42 and @entity43 player was on a provisional 35 - man list for the @entity6 squad , but @entity3 insists he is still looking forward to the @entity2 , which start next month , despite the snub
" as a londoner i was really proud to have played a small part in bringing the @entity2 to my home town as part of @entity51 's team , " he said
" i ca n't wait for the @entity2 to begin and enjoy every moment along with the rest of @entity33
" reports in the @entity6 media have suggested @entity3 's former @entity42 teammate @entity56 has been selected as one of @entity9 's three over-age players , along with @entity60 's @entity59 and @entity61 of @entity62
the choice of 38 - year - old @entity65 midfielder @entity56 , @entity67 international defender @entity66 and @entity68 forward @entity63 would provide @entity9 with cover in all areas of his squad
@entity3 has not played international football since coming on as a substitute during @entity67 's 3 - 0 win over @entity75 in 2009
football culture : who are you ? warrior or tika taka technician ? his omission provoked surprise on social - networking site @entity84 as well as criticism for @entity9 , with former @entity88 midfielder @entity87 , who played with @entity3 in @entity42 's youth team , labeling the @entity25 coach as " clueless
" former @entity67 striker @entity91 added : " there are arguments for and against db selection
what i do n't understand though , is why string him along by including him in a short list ? " on another note ... will be brilliant to see @entity56 finally have the opportunity to play in a major tournament
" @entity25 has been drawn in @entity102 of the tournament , alongside @entity103 , two - time champions @entity104 and @entity106
@entity9 's team will begin their campaign against @entity103 at @entity56 ' home stadium @entity109 on july 26 -- the day before the @entity2 officially start .
