-- we are well into the fall season , so by now , you probably have had your fill of pumpkin and @entity7 beers , so now is the time to give a fresh hop beer a try
@entity12 is harvest time for the hop growers of the @entity15 , where a majority of hops are grown in the @entity18 while most of the hops picked are dried and preserved , some hops are spared from the drying kiln and sent directly to brewers within 24 - 48 hours
these hops are referred to as " wet hops
" whole fresh hop cones provide a more grassy and juicy aroma and flavor to the beer by retaining precious lupulin oils from the hop flower
@entity31 hop beers are the ultimate example of farm - to - glass , and are designed to celebrate the agriculture of beer
@entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 obviously have an advantage in getting the freshest picked hops , but more and more breweries outside of the hop growing regions are going to extreme lengths to get the freshest hops into the brew kettle
i gathered as many of these " freshies " as i could get my hands on for a taste test , along with a group of fellow beer lovers , and have listed the cream of the crop
these harvest ales wo n't be available much longer , so you better hop to it and try some today
please share your favorite wet hop beer in the comments below
@entity62 -- @entity63 @entity63 has been brewing up wet hop beers since 1996 , so they have got it down
they even produce a wet hop beer from hops grown on their estate in @entity69 , @entity70
the fresh @entity72 and @entity73 hops give this balanced beer some citrus and herbal notes , but they 're not overpowering
definite pine and grassy notes crop up at the end , but the sweetness from the malts calm things down a bit
born yesterday @entity84 -- @entity85 this was the clear front - runner this year in the wet hop category
the freshness of this pale ale really shines through from beginning to end
tropical fruits and pine hit you across the face right upon opening it up , and it should , considering the lengths that @entity85 went through in order to get this beer in your hands as fresh as possible
the wet hops are truly the star of this pale ale
harvest ale -- @entity106 who knew that one of the best wet hopped beers would be straight out of @entity110 , @entity111 ? it 's a brilliantly juiced up ipa with intense pine and tropical fruit flavor
the fresh hops shine all the way through to the finish
according the brewery , fresh hops from both @entity38 and @entity111 were used in this year 's batch of their delicious harvest ale
@entity124 ' @entity123 -- @entity125 this ipa features fresh cut @entity127 hops trucked in straight from the fields in nearby @entity130 , @entity38
tropical notes are again showcased in this one , along with heavy pine and subtle bread - y sweetness
@entity134 and crisp , and a very easy drinker for 7.2 % alcohol by volume
@entity125 also serves up a fresh hop pale ale called @entity139 , which is worth a try as well
so @entity140 , @entity141 -- @entity142 each year @entity142 pays tribute to the hop by featuring a single wet hop that is flown down on a midnight plane to @entity147 from @entity130
this year @entity142 features @entity148 , which is a heavily aromatic hop that gives lots of earthy pine and passionfruit characteristics
this brew tastes like a freshly mowed lawn of pine needles , with a fruity slightly bitter finish
it is a truly another one hop wonder from @entity142
@entity159 -- @entity160 this is one juicy fresh hop beer , which is surprising given its very drinkable 4.7 % @entity162
@entity163 's @entity160 uses only seedless hop cones in this session @entity112 to deliver a citrus - y but not at all bitter brew
@entity168 to @entity169 -- @entity170 a very ambitious undertaking by @entity169 to get a whopping six tons of fresh hops hauled in refrigerated trucks from @entity174 to their @entity176 , @entity177 , brewery for this fresh hop offering
tons of grapefruit and a pungent hop aroma lead the way , alongside @entity169 's signature malts , provide a bread - y sweetness
fresh hop -- @entity186 another early adopter of the wet hop movement , @entity186 give us a pale ale with grassy hop flavor with heavy grapefruit and a little pine on the finish
@entity196 bitterness and an all - around well balanced beer
warrior ipa -- @entity198 probably the only wet hop beer on the list not featuring @entity15 hops
warrior is made with fresh wet cascade hops from the high altitudes of @entity204
once harvested , the hops are loaded onto a small plane and flown about an hour to the @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity204
heavy - handed ipa -- @entity210 @entity210 from @entity211 put out three separate versions of their heavy handed fresh hop @entity112 , with each one featuring a single hop
this year they have released them in @entity217 , @entity72 and @entity73
we were able to get our hands on the @entity73 version of this beer
the @entity222 was probably sweeter than most of the fresh hop beers we tried , with a caramel flavors with a citrus twist .
