-- @entity3 will pay @entity4 , @entity5 , $ 70 million in restitution for the pipeline rupture that killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in september 2010 , the utility and city said monday
" this money will be used for the benefit of all the citizens of our city and to help us , as a community , get beyond the tragedy and devastation caused by @entity3 's explosion and fire , " @entity4 mayor @entity10 said in a joint news release
federal officials said in august that a faulty pipe , flawed operations and inadequate government oversight led to the natural gas explosion in the @entity28 suburb
" the community of @entity4 has suffered through a terrible tragedy and we understand that this accident will affect this community forever , " @entity3 president @entity29 said
the city will establish a separate not - for - profit public purpose entity to manage the funds and determine how the restitution should be spent for the benefit of the community as a whole , the statement said
" this $ 70 million payment is in addition to @entity3 's commitment to fund replacement and repair of the city 's infrastructure and other costs related to the accident and restoration of the neighborhood , " it said
" the utility will not seek to recover the contribution through insurance or customer rates
" during a public board meeting after delivering their final report on the matter , @entity60 investigators sharply criticized pipeline owner @entity3 for the explosion , saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956
that was compounded " by a litany of failures " over the years , including poor record - keeping , inadequate inspection programs and " an integrity management program without integrity , " @entity60 chairwoman @entity68 said
" it was not a question of if this pipeline would burst , " she said
" it was a question of when
" @entity68 said the probe yielded " troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight , and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety
