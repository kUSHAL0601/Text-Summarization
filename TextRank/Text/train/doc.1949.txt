editor 's note : @entity2 , an award - winning journalist and author , joined now on @entity5 as senior correspondent in 2005
@entity2 , who formerly covered urban affairs for @entity8 , also serves as anchor and managing editor of @entity12 's " @entity11 , " a weekly national program reporting on news and culture in the @entity17 community
@entity2 says @entity19 's success has helped boost self - confidence for many
@entity21 ( @entity8 ) -- it 's a question i never thought i would ask my daughter
but i loved being able to ask it
" @entity26 ? " " yes , @entity28 , " my 11 - year - old daughter said
" tell me what t - shirt you would most like to wear : one that says ' i am a @entity34 , ' ' my mother is a @entity34 ' or ' @entity19 is a @entity34 ' ? " she cocked her head slightly and then quickly said , " i am a @entity34
" eleven years old , and this is the vision she already has of herself
it 's a pretty wonderful thing to watch that certain something blossom in a girl ... one of those often fleeting moments when a girl owns her own power
for me , the decision to wear my own " @entity34 " t - shirt raises all kinds of issues
it makes me confront a past that i have known for decades
deep down inside , i , like many other @entity50 , struggle with my own very deep insecurities in relation to my white male colleagues
i think after witnessing history on television for the past two weeks , those insecurities have pretty much dissipated
@entity19 has blazed the trail
i ca n't go back to thinking that way , anymore , ever
before , when i told people that i was a @entity34 , i never knew what , if any , image they might have in their mind
everyone carries stereotypes and preconceived notions
but now when i say to people that i am a @entity34 , might they immediately think , " a wise @entity34 " ? my daughter is learning all of these lessons from @entity19 , a @entity70 woman
when i was @entity26 's age , back in the ' 70s , the only @entity70 woman i knew of was @entity2 ( played by @entity72 ) from " @entity73
" i grew up on the @entity75 of @entity76 after being born in @entity77
my @entity2 from @entity73 taught me that love and commitment could transcend borders and divisions
@entity19 is teaching @entity26 , and all of us , that intelligence and compassion ( and an honest way with words ) can also cross all borders : political ones , those of gender or ethnicity
and i have learned that my own challenge now is to reach this very high bar that @entity19 has set
i must " own " that i am , indeed , a wise @entity34
later on the day of the t - shirt decision , my daughter hears my reaction when i read that sen. @entity96 , whom my daughter knows well because we followed the election , is going to vote against @entity19 's confirmation
" what a big jerk ! " was her age - appropriate response
then , after a pause , @entity26 said , " so that means @entity96 thinks @entity103 is a wise woman ? but not @entity19 ? harrumph
" " @entity106 " is also an age - appropriate response
but the lasting impact of @entity96 's decision will be much more profound than upsetting an 11 - year - old wise @entity34 girl
in fact , i would venture to say that , politically , there are many in the @entity113 who are convinced this was a politically unwise choice by @entity96
it 's just not that complicated
look at the changing demographics in the @entity119
then think about what happens when you vote against the first @entity123 nominee
maybe @entity96 is n't wise enough to see that reality , so i will tell him a story about a @entity127 - born , @entity119 citizen cabby from my @entity129 neighborhood
while he drove down @entity130 , i asked the cabby if he thought that president @entity132 was pandering to the @entity17 communities across the country with the @entity19 nomination
" @entity136 ! " he exclaimed in a true @entity127 style
" he is not pandering
he owes us ! everyone knows now that without the @entity17 vote , you can not win the presidency
he has to deliver , politically
i am a new citizen , and i voted for @entity132 my first time
just like a bunch of us @entity127 cabbies
now this is my country and my politics
" " and is that the way you guys talk amongst yourselves ? that the @entity17 vote is that powerful ? " " @entity152 , asi lo vemos
that 's how we see it ! but even though we love @entity19 , @entity132 still owes us
" and what must @entity132 deliver to satisfy this very politically astute cabby ? " @entity158 ! he must solve this immigration problem
so @entity132 must understand that is what we want him to deliver now
" a wise latino with some wise advice for the president
and for @entity96 and the @entity113 ? @entity169 , winning the next elections ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
