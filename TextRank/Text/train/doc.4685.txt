@entity0 -- former @entity3 spy @entity2 , who headed @entity5 operations in the @entity6 in the 1970s and later left @entity7 to live in @entity6 , told @entity1 tuesday he is " amazed " that @entity8 is engaging so heavily in espionage against @entity0
reacting to the recent arrests of 11 alleged @entity7 spies , @entity2 said that getting the type of information the @entity12 says the operatives collected " does not require such a massive assault " against the @entity6
" i am amazed , " he said
" it reminds me of the worst years of the @entity18
" @entity2 also said he was " amused " by reports of the arrests
" it is a sign of the decadence of the @entity7 intelligence services , " he said
" why do they need to use so many people to get information that is openly available ? " @entity27 : the spies next door ? the @entity30 announced monday that 10 people had been arrested in the @entity6 on charges of being @entity7 spies on long - term missions in the @entity6 @entity36 spokesman called the suspects " trained @entity7 intelligence operatives
" an 11th suspect was arrested tuesday in @entity40 , @entity40 police told @entity1
the government 's complaints against the alleged operatives say their mission was " to become sufficiently americanized such that they can gather information about the @entity6 for @entity7 , and can successfully recruit sources who are in , or able to infiltrate , @entity6 policy - making circles
" @entity2 said that has been a mission for @entity3 and @entity7 operatives for decades : to look for potential spies in the @entity6 with the ultimate purpose of placing them in key government agencies like the @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity58
@entity2 added that he was impressed by the " efficiency " of the @entity12 , which apparently was able to keep the suspects under control for several years
he said @entity12 agents have not " lost their focus " and noted that it is difficult to ferret out such spies
the former @entity3 spy told @entity1 he did not believe that @entity7 president @entity68 knew of the pending arrests during his visit to the @entity58 last thursday , but his impression was that president @entity72 did know and it was reflected in a " rather strained " visit with @entity68
@entity2 said he now feels that " something was brewing
" he also explained that he is not surprised that several of the suspects are listed as former @entity77 citizens
he said @entity77 , with a large number of @entity7 and former @entity3 émigrés , has been used for decades by @entity3 intelligence as a " jumping ground " to pick up people for possible espionage operations in the @entity6
the reports of alleged @entity7 espionage , @entity2 believes , " will sober up some minds in the @entity6 who believe that @entity7 is a totally different country
" @entity2 said former @entity7 president and now prime minister @entity89 -- himself a former @entity5 agent -- has restored the role of the intelligence agency , now called the @entity93 , and its arm that deals with foreign intelligence , the @entity96
" old habits have been restored , " he said
" the @entity6 used to be enemy no. 1 for the @entity5 , " he said
" now it is priority no. 1
