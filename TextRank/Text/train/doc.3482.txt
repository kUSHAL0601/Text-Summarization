@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 has named a new target as global sparring over @entity6 grows : food
in a decree signed wednesday , @entity2 banned food and agricultural imports from countries that have imposed sanctions against his country
the retaliatory move comes more than a week after the @entity15 and @entity16 increased economic sanctions on @entity0 for supporting @entity19 separatists fighting @entity6 government forces in the eastern regions of @entity22 and @entity23 , along the border with @entity3
a list of specific products and food bans is still being worked out by the @entity3 government , according to the decree , which describes the order as a special economic measure " aimed at ensuring the security of the @entity3
" @entity3 is @entity34 's largest importer in value of animals , meat , dairy products , fruits and vegetables , according to the @entity16
and goods from the @entity16 represent 16 % of all @entity3 imports , @entity16 numbers show
search for @entity46 victims halted for now @entity2 said measures would be taken to prevent a jump in food prices in @entity3
a senior @entity15 administration official told @entity1 a ban in imports will only deepen @entity3 's international isolation and work against the country 's own economic interest
" @entity3 's @entity58 yesterday pointed out that bans on imported food will push up @entity3 's already high inflation rate , eroding the purchasing power of @entity3 citizens , " the official said
the @entity15 insists that sanctions against @entity3 businesses and individuals are having and effect and already weakened @entity3 's economy
" sanctions are working as intended in putting enormous pressure and strain on the @entity3 economy
... the economy has ground to halt , " @entity15 president @entity73 told reporters on wednesday
if @entity2 does n't push to resolve problems in eastern @entity6 through diplomacy and peaceful means , @entity73 said , " he 's going to be hurting his economy and his own people over the long term
" but so far , @entity73 said , violence in @entity6 has n't stopped even as sanctions against @entity3 have increased
" the issue is not resolved yet , " he said
' you still have fighting in eastern @entity6
" @entity3 has denied allegations that it 's supporting separatists in @entity6 and maintains that it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis
but @entity15 and @entity6 officials have accused @entity3 of saying one thing while doing another -- building up troops along the border and continuing to send support to @entity19 separatists
several countries imposed sanctions on @entity0 after @entity3 annexed @entity101 in march , which escalated the @entity6 conflict following the ouster of @entity105 president @entity104 a month earlier
since then , tensions have simmered and flared in @entity6 , with frequent battles between @entity6 government forces and @entity110 separatists in the eastern part of the country
a new buildup of @entity3 troops along the @entity6 border raised concerns tuesday that @entity0 might be contemplating another intervention like the annexation of @entity101
according to a @entity120 official , @entity3 now has about 20,000 troops stationed " in an area along the entire border with eastern @entity6
" the buildup nearly doubled the troop deployment in the last week by adding 8,000 more forces to 12,000 already there , the official said
in addition , @entity3 's @entity128 is staging a week of military exercises involving air troops and anti-missile defense forces
the exercises are taking place in @entity3 's southern @entity136 region , roughly 500 miles from the border with @entity6
similar military exercises in the region preceded the annexation of @entity101
@entity15 , @entity16 coordinate on @entity3 sanctions , but will they work ? things to know about @entity3 and sanctions @entity3 troop increase at @entity6 border raises concerns @entity1 's @entity144 and @entity145 reported from @entity146
@entity1 's @entity147 reported from @entity0
@entity1 's @entity148 , @entity149 and journalist @entity150 contribute to this report .
