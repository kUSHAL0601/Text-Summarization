@entity0 -- @entity2 is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she 's reviving two years after his death
@entity7 took to the stage in @entity0 on thursday and performed their 1995 song scream as video of @entity7 played and his voice filled @entity13
the reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer @entity18 and his daughter , @entity17
in 1991 she turned her father 's famous 1961 recording " @entity22 " into a father - daughter duet
@entity2 said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago
" i was on the rhythm nation tour and @entity28 actually asked me to do a song with him and i told him no. i did n't want to do it
i felt i had n't come into my own and i had n't fully made a name for myself ... and i did n't want to ride anyone 's coattails , " she said
" and i remember being in the @entity35 a few good years later and he asked me again if i would do a song with him
and i felt , at that point , i 'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and i felt okay , i can do this now and that 's how it came about
" @entity7 said that performing the song alongside her brother again is n't difficult
" it feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice , " she said , adding that on stage she finds herself , " remembering the experience of recording it
" @entity7 declined to comment to the press on the two - year mark of her brother 's death , instead taking to social media this week with a simple message on @entity57 on the june 25 anniversary : " i miss you , i love you
" @entity7 wraps up the @entity61 leg of her tour this week then heads to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 .
