@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is beaming , smiling from ear to ear , standing in the gym of a high school outside @entity0 , @entity1
around her , 15 kids who should be on spring break are cheering
nearby is a robot , about 4 feet high , crafted from metal and stuffed with wires and circuits
it had just been announced the winner -- the top robot -- of the @entity18 regional competition
the robotics competition challenges tens of thousands of high school students to fund , design and built robot with limited materials and time -- just six weeks
each year , students on the robotics team at @entity27 name their creation after someone who inspires them
this robot 's name is @entity32 , for @entity3 , the 26 - year - old undocumented activist , a former member of the team who still volunteers with them
@entity3 was born in 1984 , in @entity37 , @entity38 , about a seven - hour drive from @entity0
when she was 15 , she came to the @entity40 to live with her mother , who had moved here previously
she enrolled as a sophomore at @entity43 , and one of her first classes was marine biology , taught by @entity47
at the time , @entity47 was just starting the first robotics team at the school and was looking for his first members
he showed @entity3 's class a video of the competition and she was hooked
" when he said you just needed to be willing to learn , that motivated me to go , " she said
" i thought ' i am the perfect candidate
i did n't even really speak @entity56 that well
' i certainly did n't know anything about robots
" she learned to build , improved her @entity56 , and soon @entity3 was expanding her role
she designed the team 's website , campaigned for donations , and gave speeches
being on @entity47 's robotics team was n't just about robots -- every day was a lesson in opportunities beyond @entity27
@entity68 , a student on @entity43 's robotics team @entity47 puts a special emphasis on attending college
when @entity3 was working on college applications during her senior year of high school , it became clear that her undocumented status could get in her way
" i remember applying , " she said , " and it would n't let me do that because it was online and you had to have a social security number
" @entity3 learned she does not have legal residency in the @entity40 , and she is not a citizen
the @entity85 estimates that 65,000 students like @entity3 graduate from @entity40 high schools every year
there is no federal law or state prohibiting colleges , either public or private , from admitting undocumented students
but there are numerous hurdles to earn that degree
@entity47 and @entity3 visited a recruiting counselor from @entity98 , and in the end she was accepted
but as an undocumented student , @entity3 did n't qualify for federal financial aid
@entity47 took @entity3 to meeting after meeting , until they found private scholarships that would allow her to start at the university in fall 2003
@entity3 went on to graduate with a degree in electrical engineering , but unlike a lot of her peers , it was n't a celebratory experience for her
" i knew there was a problem , but at the same time , everyone tells you , ' if you work hard and be a good student that things will align and work out , ' " she said
" and it was true , so far , because i was able to go to college and graduate , but at the same time , i think , reality really sunk in and i got depressed because i was seeing my peers take internships or getting full - time jobs at engineering firms ... i know i was capable of getting that job but i could n't get it because of my status
" unable to work in engineering after graduating , @entity3 continued working the real estate job she had during college
organizing other undocumented students became her passion
during her crusade to attend college , she had met hundreds of other young people like herself -- she realized she was n't alone
she started organizing other people , and together , they began campaigning for passage of the @entity138 , a proposal to allow a path to citizenship for undocumented students after completion of a college degree or military service
then came the moment @entity3 took a stand
she and several other students traveled from @entity0 to @entity148 with the goal of asking senators , in person , to put the @entity138 back on the @entity153 calendar for a vote
they chose the office of sen. @entity157 , an @entity1 @entity158 whom they thought could play a key role in advancing the act
in the office , they asked for a meeting , and then sat on the floor
they stayed until 7 p.m. , when the office closed
when police asked them to leave , they refused to go , and in the end @entity3 and three friends spent the night in jail
she said she does n't regret that night
" we did everything we could , " she said
" i think i would have felt worse if i did n't get arrested because then i would have felt like , ' oh , i should have done this and done that , ' but it was also a relief because i know i did everything
" the @entity138 failed in the last session of @entity181
recently , president @entity182 has made a push for " widespread movement " of immigration reform , and encouraged @entity181 to pass the @entity138
opinion : @entity182 , stop deportation of @entity138 students when the students at @entity43 high school heard about her arrest , they were inspired to know a former student , someone much like themselves , led a national charge for a cause
at the school , which is 94 % @entity199 , robotics coach @entity47 estimates that many students are undocumented , like @entity3
" it helps maybe motivate some children that some students that we have here on campus that might be in her same situation in the future , " @entity47 said
current robotics team members have led marches and petitioned their legislature for reform
" a lot of our team is aware of the situation , " said team member @entity215 , " and a lot of us , if it 's not directly , [ are ] indirectly affected by it
" after the team won the regional competition , they moved on to the nationals in @entity227
@entity3 traveled there with the team to cheer them on
she compared having a robot named after her to winning the lottery
" it 's like a driving force and it goes in a circle , " she said
" they motivate me and i hope i motivate them
" " sometimes , " she added , " we are afraid of pursuing our dreams , but @entity47 [ @entity47 ] said , ' you do n't have to be afraid , it 's a matter of how you are going to control that feeling to continue
' am i going to let my immigration status dictate my life ? or am i going to let being afraid dictate my life ? " her answer ? neither .
