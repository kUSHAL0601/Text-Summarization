@entity0 is in the midst of its longest series of political protests since the 1997 handover
pro-democracy activists say they are making good on a long - threatened vow to try and paralyze the city 's financial district -- a key business hub for the region and beyond -- through sit - ins and civil disobedience
clashes between students and police this weekend have been the most heated in a long summer of @entity19 protests
dozens have been reported injured by authorities
their goal is to pressure @entity23 into giving the former @entity25 colony full universal suffrage
@entity27 has so far refused to cede ground on its stance , setting the scene for growing , and more intense , clashes
here are five things to know about @entity0 as political tensions ratchet up : 1
it 's not just another @entity23 city a city of towering skyscrapers on @entity23 's southeastern tip , @entity0 is home to 7 million people
when the city was returned to @entity23 in 1997 a deal was struck promising " a high degree of autonomy " to @entity0 under a formula dubbed " @entity44
" the city 's @entity47 or " mini-constitution " has allowed the city to carry on with its own legal and financial system and @entity0 enjoys civil liberties unseen in mainland @entity23 such as an independent judiciary , freedom of the press and the right to protest
it also states that " universal suffrage " is the ultimate aim for @entity0 but it does not give a timetable or detail how political reform should take shape
currently , @entity0 's leader , known as the chief executive , is elected by a 1,200 - strong committee stacked with @entity27 loyalists
people are fed up surveys show that the government 's approval rating is sinking , while distrust of @entity23 's central government in @entity27 is at its highest level since the handover
discontent , especially among the young , is driven by a widening wealth gap and many resent the influx of free - spending mainland @entity23 visitors to the city who buy up everything from apartments to baby milk formula
a survey released on september 21 said that one in five people were considering emigrating
the latest wave of protests came after @entity27 in august rejected demands for people to freely choose the city 's next leader in 2017
pro-democracy groups responded by unleashing threats to disrupt the city 's @entity98 financial district -- where many big banks and other businesses are located -- in a campaign known as " @entity98
" democracy supporters come from a broad cross section of society including students , religious leaders , university professors and financial professionals
after months of forewarning , @entity98 began formally on sunday , with thousands of protesters , many wearing eye and clothing protection , beginning a sit in around government buildings
supporters want to force discussions , and even concessions , over @entity27 's influence on @entity0

not everyone supports the protests pro-beijing groups like " @entity124 for @entity0 " say the activists will " endanger @entity0 " and create chaos
they have held their own rallies against @entity98 and ran advertising campaigns in local media to highlight their fears
the biggest rally , on august 17 , was attended by thousands , although questions were raised about its legitimacy amid reports that marchers were paid to show up
businesses fear that any campaign targeting the city 's financial district will harm @entity0 's reputation as a safe and stable place to do business
an opinion poll conducted this month by @entity144 said that 46 % did not support the @entity98 campaign , while 31 % backed the civil disobedience movement
@entity23 thinks @entity0 is " confused " @entity27 , in a policy document released in june , said that @entity0 does not enjoy " full autonomy " and residents are " confused or lopsided in their understanding " of " @entity44
" the rhetoric indicates that @entity27 is unlikely to budge on its prescription for electoral reform in the city
@entity156 , a senior @entity23 official , suggested that screening candidates was necessary to ensure the chief executive " loves @entity23 , loves @entity0 and will safeguard the country 's sovereignty , security and development interests
" @entity23 has also sought to blame the pro-democracy opposition in @entity0 on interference by @entity25 and the @entity165
all eyes are on @entity27 and how it will respond to the growing waves of protests
the central government is in a tricky situation of not being able to be seen as backing down on its stance but at the same time needing to be wary over the use of force and the implications of doing so
the government says @entity0 should accept deal on offer the @entity0 government says its people should accept the deal on electoral reform offered by @entity27
the new framework will allow @entity0 's 5 million registered voters to select their leader , although candidates must be approved by a committee similar to the one that selected the city 's top official in 2012
critics say that this means only candidates favored by @entity27 will appear on the ballot , but @entity0 's current chief executive , @entity196 , writing in an op ed for @entity198 , says that this is not the case
" we have not even started to discuss the detailed but crucial aspects of the nominating process for potential chief executive candidates , " he writes
" raw emotion -- for or against the proposed political reform -- will get us nowhere
