-- @entity1 appealed friday for a halt to settlements to those affected by the massive 2010 @entity6 oil spill , because of what it says are " hundreds of millions of dollars , and what could reach billions of dollars , in awards to claims asserting fictitious losses
" " any such payment will constitute irreparable harm , " the energy giant argued
" therefore , an expedited hearing is necessary
" such a hearing is now scheduled for march 22 , after the court granted @entity1 's emergency motion
the legal debate is part of the widespread fallout from the oil spill -- the worst in @entity24 history -- which began after a rig explosion aboard the @entity26 in the @entity6
roughly 205 million gallons of oil spewed into the sea for nearly three months before a cap was placed on the @entity1 - owned @entity31 , nearly a mile beneath the surface
since then , the oil company has promised and paid out some settlement funds , while fighting others in court
earlier this year , @entity24 district judge @entity37 considered @entity1 's contention that a january 15 decision by the claims administrator about how settlements would be distributed
@entity1 had argued that the set - up would produce " absurd " results
and yet @entity37 sided against @entity1 in a march 5 decision
" the court adopts @entity48 's interpretation as it is most in line with the rest of the settlement agreement , " the judge wrote .
