last week 's massacre at a @entity2 movie theater revived the dormant gun control debate in the @entity4 , but neither president @entity5 nor @entity7 candidate @entity6 is pushing for new laws now to prevent similar attacks
@entity5 supports reinstating a ban on manufacturing some semi-automatic weapons for civilian use that expired eight years ago , but congressional inaction on the issue has caused the president to instead seek better enforcement of existing laws , his spokesman said thursday
" the assault weapons ban is an issue that the president has supported the reinstatement of since its expiration in 2004 , " @entity24 press secretary @entity23 told reporters
" but given the stalemate in @entity30 , our focus is on steps that we can take to make sure criminals and others who should not have those guns , make sure that they can not obtain them
" @entity2 hospitals chip in for shooting victims ' care @entity6 , meanwhile , says no new laws are needed while acknowledging the current ones can not stop someone intent on doing harm from obtaining guns
" i do n't support new gun laws in our country , " @entity6 told @entity45 's @entity44 in an interview thursday , adding later that " the effort to continue to look for some law to somehow make violence go away is missing the point
" the real point , he said , is to prevent people who are " deranged and distressed " from " carrying out terrible acts , " noting that @entity57 bomber @entity56 used fertilizer to make the explosives for the attack that killed 168 people in 1995
" with products that can be purchased legally anywhere in the world , he was able to carry out vast mayhem , " @entity6 said
" somehow thinking that laws against the instruments of violence will make violence go away , i think , is misguided
" the gun - control issue is one of the most politically divisive in @entity4 politics , especially in a presidential election year
for that reason , both campaigns had generally ignored it , despite mass killings in recent years -- a gunman who killed 32 people at @entity80 in 2007 and another who killed six people and wounded 13 others , including @entity85 rep. @entity84 , last year in @entity86
making peace with a monster now the july 20 shooting in @entity90 , @entity2 , by a lone gunman who killed 12 people and wounded scores of others has brought the debate back to the forefront
both @entity5 and @entity6 immediately condemned the slaughter and expressed sympathy , with @entity5 traveling to @entity90 on sunday to meet with survivors and families of victims
however , @entity5 avoided any talk of gun control measures until a speech wednesday night to the @entity105 in which he expressed support for @entity108 rights but said more needed to be done to prevent gun violence
" i also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that ak - 47s belong in the hands of soldiers , not in the hands of criminals , " @entity5 said
" that they belong on the battlefield of war , not on the streets of our cities
" his comments followed criticism from @entity126 mayor @entity125 , liberal filmmaker @entity127 and others calling for more than commiseration with the survivors
" soothing words are nice , but maybe it 's time that the two people who want to be president of the @entity4 stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it , because this is obviously a problem across the country , " said @entity125 , an independent who supports gun control
@entity127 -- whose documentary " @entity142 " examined the @entity4 gun culture in the wake of the 1999 @entity2 massacre in which two high school students killed 12 people -- challenged @entity5 on what his response would be if his own daughters were victims of such an incident
" if president @entity5 is watching right now , and i say this with all due respect : what if it were them ? " @entity127 told @entity45 's " @entity157 " earlier this week
" ... would you stand at the microphone the next day and say i feel your pain and ... the existing laws are enough ? is that really what you 'd say , mr. president ? i do n't think so
" some conservatives also called for action , with media mogul @entity167 tweeting after last week 's shootings that " we have to do something about gun controls " while @entity173 host @entity171 said in a july 23 commentary that @entity30 should pass laws requiring that sales of heavy weapons be reported to the @entity178 and imposing mandatory 10 - year sentences on any crime committed with a gun
" that would dent the problem , " @entity171 said
" but the truth is criminals will always get guns
" official : trap in @entity2 suspect 's home had 30 homemade grenades , gasoline last year , @entity5 mentioned gun safety only in passing after the @entity86 shootings that injured @entity84
two months later , the president wrote an opinion piece that acknowledged the importance of the @entity108 and called for focusing on " effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible , law - breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place
" his three - step plan included enforcing existing laws , rewarding states that provide the best data about gun owners , and a better system for background checks
@entity23 outlined a similar response thursday , saying background checks have been strengthened and calling for a more comprehensive community effort to reduce gun violence
however , @entity5 supported a tougher platform when he ran for president in 2008 that included reinstituting the assault weapons ban , stopping destruction of background check documents and closing the federal gun show loophole
gun safety advocates have expressed disappointment with the president 's actions since taking office , particularly over his failure to fight for reinstatement of the assault weapons ban
on thursday , the @entity229 to strengthen gun control called for a national dialogue on solutions to gun violence , such as criminal background checks on all gun purchases
however , the group 's president , @entity236 , stopped short of calling for stronger steps such as reinstating the assault weapons ban or limiting access to high - powered ammunition
" what we 're asking for is the voice of the @entity4 public to engage in this issue and to hold our leaders accountable , " @entity236 told reporters
meanwhile , a group of law enforcement officials who have joined up against gun violation called thursday for expanded background checks on gun sales via the @entity255 and weapons shows , as well as a ban on high - capacity ammunition magazines
one reason for political inaction is a public preference for gun ownership , as expressed in opinion polls and advocated by the powerful @entity263
a @entity265 poll in april found that 55 % of highly coveted independents feel it is " more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns , " with 40 % saying controlling gun ownership is more important
the poll also found that 72 % of @entity7 feel protecting gun ownership is important , while 27 % of @entity85 feel that way
threats before , after other ' @entity274 ' showings , authorities said the @entity263 has labeled @entity5 an enemy of @entity108 rights , and so far in the 2012 election cycle , @entity6 has received $ 126,440 from gun rights groups , compared to @entity5 's $ 2,300
that trend is consistent with the 2008 cycle , when @entity7 nominee @entity282 collected $ 483,711 in such contributions and @entity5 received $ 25,987
" historically the pro-control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws , " said @entity284 , an associate professor of public policy and political science at @entity287 and author of " disarmed : the @entity294 for @entity295 in @entity4
" " for a long time these gun violence rates and massacres speak for themselves , " @entity284 said
" they relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well - disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart
" gross of the @entity229 -- named after former @entity24 press secretary @entity304 , who was shot in the head during the 1981 assassination attempt of president @entity307 -- argued thursday that the @entity263 's influence is not so pervasive
" despite the fact that the @entity263 spent $ 6.67 million against him in 2008 , @entity5 beat the @entity263 like a drum , winning 11 of 13 states where the @entity263 spend significantly on ads , " @entity236 said
" @entity5 also won 17 states with significant numbers of gun owners
" he also noted that @entity6 supported an assault weapons ban when he was @entity317 governor
asked about his stance in @entity317 , @entity6 told @entity319 on wednesday that the legislation he signed banning assault weapons " was backed both by the @entity108 advocates , like myself , and those that wanted to restrict gun rights , because it was a compromise
" referring to suspect @entity326 in the latest @entity2 killings , @entity6 said : " a lot of what this young man did was clearly against the law
the fact that it was against the law did not prevent it from happening
" looking into the minds of killers gun owners and collectors also reject the contention that tougher controls will solve the problem
" if everyone legally owned and carried a gun , " argued collector @entity342 of @entity343 , @entity344 , " there would be a lot less crime
" do you own a gun ? share a photo and tell us why
opinion : @entity355 got one thing right on gun control warning signs of violence : what to do
