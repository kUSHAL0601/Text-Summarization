-- he held power over his country for more than 30 years , and his ouster last year was seen as a sign that the @entity6 could bring unlikely revolutions to the @entity8
but if @entity11 were to die soon -- as some close to him suggest could happen -- it would probably have little impact on the country 's future , experts said wednesday
speaking the day after a state news agency called @entity11 " clinically dead , " and the nation 's military rulers said he was instead in critical condition , analysts in @entity17 said his death would probably not trigger widespread outpourings of grief , nor ripple effects on how the new government is shaped
there could , however , be a new round of angry protests if he received a military funeral , they said
conflicting reports about whether @entity11 has died @entity11 " has been politically dead for a year and a half , " said @entity33 , an @entity34 expert with @entity35 , who has spent the past month in @entity17
" i would suspect that if he would die , not a lot of people would care
" @entity39 , chair of the history department at the @entity41 , said reports about @entity11 's health add to " anxiety and confusion " in the country , but " this is not the main thing that is happening in @entity34 now
" across the country , people are concerned about the future of the government , after the highest court dissolved parliament , military rulers claimed full legislative authority , and both candidates in the presidential runoff election claimed victory
furthermore , reports of @entity11 's potential demise are nothing new
@entity11 off life support " people have grown so accustomed to people saying @entity11 is having near - death experiences that no one really takes them seriously , " @entity33 said
at the hospital where he was being treated tuesday night , there was no additional security , no crowd outside
meanwhile , protesters at @entity71 questioned the accuracy of the reports and said they were focused entirely on getting a new government in place
" i 've come from far away
i 'm not leaving until ( @entity82 ) @entity81 swears the oath in front of the legitimately elected parliament , " said @entity77 , who supports the @entity79 candidate for president
" we 're having a sit - in
i do n't care about @entity11
these are games played by the intelligence services
" " it 's a media stunt , to divert attention from the constitutional decree , " said demonstrator @entity90 , referring to a move by the military council stripping the presidency of some powers
" we 've started a sit - in and wo n't leave unless the @entity99 leaves unconditionally
" the life of @entity11 throughout @entity17 on wednesday , " the only thing " people were talking about was the presidential battle , @entity33 said
if @entity11 were to die , it would not make a blip in the course of @entity34 history , he said
" i think there will be a lot of mythology about @entity11 in the years to come
but i would not expect massive turnout to take over @entity17 or parts of the country
... in fact , if there is any public participation , it 's going to be a celebration of his death
" a " major part of the population " actually supports the status quo -- the military leadership -- and does not want the @entity79 , which opposed @entity11 's regime , to take over , @entity33 said
but few among them support @entity11 himself
" @entity11 has largely been portrayed and understood as the reason for so much instability
" so both sides view him as " toxic , " @entity33 said
but while @entity11 's death would n't change the course of @entity34 's future , the way the country handles it could stir emotional reactions , @entity39 said
how @entity34 's generals cut the revolution down to size " i think a military funeral would enrage the people in @entity71 , " he said
" it would mean the military still respecting him and willing to turn a blind eye to the fact that he 's now a convicted criminal
" this month , @entity11 was found guilty of ordering the killing of protesters and was sentenced to life in prison
@entity152 , who was protesting tuesday in @entity71 , told @entity0 she found it " extremely provocative " for the @entity99 to suggest it was considering granting a military funeral
" this is outrageous ! he is a prisoner , " the 32 - year - old real estate agent said
still , @entity11 does maintain some support among @entity34 , says @entity159 , @entity160 professor at the @entity161 and a senior fellow with the @entity163
and as long as he is alive , whoever has control in @entity34 will have some key decisions to make about his fate
" it is obvious that the military leaders consider him one of them and they would like to do their utmost to protect him without causing violent anger
if he stays alive , they would have to contend with a possible @entity173 president who is unlikely to show leniency
" even some who oppose him want to see him treated leniently , while others " want to see him humiliated and punished , " @entity159 said
" @entity34 is divided along many lines , as the presidential elections have demonstrated , and @entity11 is a central symbol of these divisions
" his " health and stories about his health are bound to highlight the enormous divisions and the deep emotions during a critical time of transition and uncertainty
" one young protester summed up how little impact the reports of @entity11 's health -- and the possibility of his death -- have on many @entity34
" @entity11 's not any different than anyone else , " said @entity197 , 18
" i feel bad if a dog dies
i feel bad , but i also feel bad about those who died in the revolution
i think of parents who lost a child
" both presidential candidates claim victory in @entity34 @entity0 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .
