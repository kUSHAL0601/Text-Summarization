the cold gripping much of the eastern @entity1 is bitter , it 's sprawling , and it 's deadly
and it 's apparently not going away -- at least for any length of time -- anytime soon
from a frozen @entity8 to endangered @entity10 oranges , there 's no shortage of evidence about how cold it has been over the past few days
but the worst such examples come in places like @entity15 , where 10 deaths have been blamed on the harsh winter weather , according to that state 's emergency management agency
four of the deaths stemmed from car accidents , and five were tied to hypothermia , which is abnormally low body temperatures that can cause confusion , sleepiness , slowed speech or reactions , and can be fatal if not treated quickly
the 10th death was a dialysis patient who was unable to get to treatment
@entity15 is hardly the only state affected
some 185 million people are felling the deep freeze , with wind chill warnings and advisories posted for thursday and friday in more than 20 states
the @entity39 notes that temperatures on thursday were 25 to 45 degrees fahrenheit below normal in some locales , where some records should smash like an icicle
even @entity45 states like @entity46 and @entity47 , and even @entity10 -- known more for sweltering than shivering -- have hard freeze and freeze warnings in effect
and no one should expect beach days in the immediate future
instead , the weather service says , " get ready for an even more impressive surge of @entity57 air later this week as another cold front drops south from @entity59
" " there are indications " its forecast adds , " that this could be some of the coldest weather since the mid- 1990s for some parts of the @entity66 , @entity67 , and central @entity68
" things should warm up some over the weekend
but that does n't mean @entity72 residents can break out their swimsuits , what with yet more snow predicted saturday and sunday in places like @entity77 and a return to frigid temperatures next week
@entity2 's @entity80 contributed to this report .
