-- president @entity1 announced recently that about 100 @entity3 troops are being deployed to @entity4 to help " apprehend and remove " the elusive @entity5 and his top commanders of the @entity7
it 's not the first time the @entity3 has gone in to help put an end to the marauding , murdering gang known as the @entity7 -- @entity7 , for short
the @entity7 has butchered , enslaved and displaced people in @entity14 and @entity4 for two decades
although its brand of terrorism does n't target the @entity3 , @entity15 has listed it as a terrorist group
the @entity3 decision to help go after @entity5 is a strategic -- as well as a humanitarian -- one
@entity4 is a frontier for terrorism
@entity14 is fighting @entity22 militants in @entity23 -- which helps the @entity3 -- so in turn , the @entity3 is helping @entity14 fight the @entity7
the @entity7 began in northern @entity14 in 1987 as an opposition force to leader @entity26
@entity5 sees himself as a prophet who has said he wants to rule by following the @entity28
instead , he has ruled -- and thrived -- by breaking a lot of those commandments
the @entity14 army -- with the help of the @entity3 military -- has tried for years to take him and his leadership out
the @entity35 has had a warrant out for him since 2005
the @entity7 replenishes its ranks by abducting villagers -- men , women and children -- brainwashing them and forcing them to fight
or to serve as sex slaves for commanders
@entity7 members survive by staying on the move constantly and stealing food and provisions
last month , according to researchers , an @entity7 band raided a village in the @entity51 soon after the @entity52 had distributed food supplies there
so what is @entity7 leader @entity5 's secret ? how has he evaded justice to operate his band of marauders and murderers with impunity for decades ? here are five reasons some experts give : 1
you 've probably seen photos of children whose noses or ears were cut off -- because they did n't obey the @entity7 's orders
he 's forced children he 's abducted to kill their siblings or parents
( more : woman recalls harrowing tale of captivity ) " they use very carefully thought - through strategies to have the biggest impact , " said @entity77 , a professor at the @entity78 and co-author of " the @entity7 : myth and reality
" " in northern @entity14 in 2004 , " @entity77 said , " they took some 20 - odd women with their babies out of the displacement camp , laid them on the ground with their babies on their backs and smashed their brains in
" and they did it at the edge of the camp -- so that everyone in the camp would see
" they did n't do that very often , " @entity77 said
" but you do n't have to do that sort of thing very often to have a large impact on a lot of people
@entity5 exploits regional politics and borders
he got support from the @entity110 government for years
and the @entity7 uses borders as a defense : it has n't been in @entity14 for years
that 's made it hard for the @entity14 army to pursue @entity5
the militia is split and is constantly moving between the @entity51 , the @entity117 and southern @entity110
@entity14 's efforts to get @entity5 have flagged
@entity14 's army has been stretched to the hilt , fighting @entity22 militants in @entity23 as part of an @entity124 force
@entity5 is a smart strategist
his band travels in small groups , and they 're a moving target
and he has informants -- with cell phones
the last time the @entity3 military helped @entity14 go after @entity5 , in 2008 , it used a traditional air and ground assault
@entity5 and his leaders escaped , then massacred hundreds of people in revenge
this time , the @entity3 is bringing @entity137 ( and probably other intelligence agents ) with equipment and tactics to track him in the jungle
@entity5 mixes military discipline with cultish charisma and spiritual tactics to keep captives in line -- and sometimes , to keep the loyalty even of those who escape
@entity77 , the @entity78 professor , has talked to women who have escaped the @entity7 but are still loyal to their @entity7 " husbands
" " he cultivates this image of himself as a medium for the power of the spirit and at other times , he presents himself as a ruthless military leader , " said @entity152 , @entity4 researcher with the @entity153
" so he 's able to maintain cohesion as a group and maintain the loyalty of his fighters
" @entity152 said some former @entity7 fighters from northern @entity14 have given a clue as to why some outside the group have stayed loyal to @entity5
" they expressed the feeling that because they were given a rank , they were given a certain purpose , and respect and authority , " @entity152 said
" and then , once they 're outside the @entity7 , they find they 've become just another poor person , trying to survive
