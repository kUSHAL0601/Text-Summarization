@entity0 -- the head of the @entity4 is being questioned by police in connection with the alleged sexual assault saturday of a @entity9 hotel housekeeping employee , @entity0 deputy police commissioner @entity2 told @entity1
@entity11 and @entity12 police pulled @entity13 off of an @entity15 flight destined for @entity16 at @entity17 after the alleged incident , according to @entity19
he was taken into custody and brought to a @entity22 police station for questioning , @entity19 said
hours earlier , @entity19 said , @entity13 emerged naked when the 32 - year - old hotel employee entered his room to clean it around 1 p.m. saturday at the @entity26
@entity19 said @entity13 tried to force himself on the woman , but she broke free and ran to the hotel 's front desk
hotel staff alerted the @entity31
by the time officers arrived , @entity13 had already left , leaving his cell phone behind at the hotel , according to @entity19
" the alleged victim was taken to @entity36 ( in @entity22 ) and was treated for minor injuries , " @entity19 said
authorities then learned that the @entity4 managing director was on an outbound flight at @entity17
@entity0 police asked their counterparts at the @entity11 to hold the plane
two plain - clothes @entity11 police detectives boarded the aircraft " just before the door closed " on the flight , and found @entity13 , 62 , seated in first class , said a law enforcement official who had been briefed on the investigation
the @entity4 executive " offered no resistance " when he was led off the plane , after which he was turned over to @entity0 police , added the official
since being detained , @entity13 has declined to answer questions from @entity0 police investigators nor has he made a statement , @entity19 said
no charges have been filed yet in the alleged incident
@entity62 , the hotel 's director of safety and security , said that @entity26 " is fully cooperating with authorities
" " we 're taking this matter extremely serious , as it 's developing , " @entity62 said
a former @entity70 finance minister , national legislator and economics professor in @entity16 , @entity13 became the @entity4 's 10th - ever managing director in november 2007
he is also chairman of the @entity4 's executive board
while @entity13 had n't officially entered the race , recent @entity70 opinion polls showed him leading prospective @entity77 presidential candidates
the surveys suggested that he also could pose a formidable challenge to incumbent @entity70 president @entity80 in the 2012 election
since assuming his position at the @entity4 , @entity13 -- and the world body -- have been repeatedly thrust into the spotlight to deal with a host of crises tied to the recent recession
in the past several months , for instance , the @entity4 head has weighed in on recent uprisings in the @entity91 and @entity92 and a multibillion - dollar bailout for @entity95 's government
that institution , based in @entity97 , is widely seen as one of the most important in the world when it comes to addressing economic inequalities and crises
@entity13 became embroiled in controversy soon after joining the @entity4 , amid reports -- which he later acknowledged -- that he 'd had an improper relationship with a female employee
the physical relationship was consensual , an independent inquiry found
the world body 's executive board concluded in october 2008 that " there was no harassment , favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director
" " nevertheless , the executive board noted that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment on the part of the managing director , as he has acknowledged and for which he has apologized , " the @entity4 said in a statement at the time
@entity13 also issued a statement following the closing of the investigation , noting that he 'd " apologized for it to the ( board of directors ) , to the staff of the @entity4 and to my family , " as well as " the staff member
" " i agree with the board that the personal behavior of the managing director sets an important tone for the institution and i am committed , going forward , to uphold the high standards that are expected of this position , " he said in the statement
@entity1 's @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this report .
