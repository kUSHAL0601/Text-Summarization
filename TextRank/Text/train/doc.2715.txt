-- this year , it 's hip to be dead
the deaths of so many celebrities in recent months have highlighted the continued public fascination with stars -- even beyond the grave -- and the booming industry surrounding dead celebs
" it 's been a crazy year , " said @entity9 , who runs @entity10 , a site devoted to tales of dead celebrities , as well as the " @entity14 " in @entity15 , @entity16 , where enthusiasts can visit sites of some of the city 's most notorious deaths
" it 's weird because even [ stars ] , who are already dead , like @entity25 , are back in the news
" it 's also a gold mine
@entity29 , chief executive officer and chairman of @entity32 -- which markets and manages several deceased celebrities ( some more easily managed dead than alive ) -- said fans often feel connected to stars long after they are gone
" i think that with celebrities , we feel like we own a piece of them , " he said
" it 's almost like being part of the family
" that family expanded during what some have dubbed the " summer of death
" from may to september , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 all died
the fascination with such celebrities can mean big bucks for their estates
and if death is the new black , @entity46 is poised to become the new arbiter of style
with the release of the documentary " @entity46 's @entity59 , " and a companion double cd , the legendary pop icon 's estate stands to add millions to its coffers
@entity46 will join the realm of @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 who rake in the cash and keep fans enthralled even from the grave

not bad for a group that is unable to make personal appearances or sign autographs
@entity29 's company represents two stars on the list ( @entity86 and @entity89 ) and quite a few living clients ( people as varied as @entity99 and boxer @entity100 ) as part of its roster of more than 300 entertainment , music , sports and historical figures and organizations
@entity29 , who declined to comment on whether he or his company is working with the @entity46 estate , said dead celebrities are often less risky for companies to use in marketing campaigns
" the fact that they are deceased , it 's not possible to have any more scandals
@entity120 today 's day and age , companies are becoming less of a risk taker , " @entity29 said
" even for someone like @entity46 , people have thrown a lot of dirt around @entity46 and we all know what that landscape is ... and it 's unlikely that anyone is going to bring up anything that would derail any type of major promotional effort
" share reviews of " @entity59 " some people take their fascination with dead celebrities to the outer limits
these fans make pilgrimages to the scene of their favorite celebrity 's death , their grave , and where they lived
in the case of @entity67 , it 's the same location , which has made @entity147 one of the most popular destinations in the @entity149
@entity9 ' findadeath.com is a favored destination of those who refer to themselves as " death hags
" from visiting grave sites to collecting autopsy photos , death hags are part of a fan culture that can rival a star 's fan club in life
" @entity164 ' lives are pretty spectacular and we followed their careers , " said @entity9
" so it makes sense that we follow their deaths
" why the attraction ? well , death is the great equalizer , said @entity174 , author of " @entity175 : the @entity176 of the @entity177 and @entity178
" " it reminds us that despite all of the money , glamour and fame , [ celebrities ] are going to die just like we all are going to die
" @entity174 has a collection of memorabilia which includes photos of some famous people after their deaths : singer @entity189 , president @entity190 , @entity86 , @entity191 and actor @entity192
" some people think it 's gruesome , " @entity174 said
" people also collect memorial cards and programs if the funeral or memorial service is open to the public
the day after a celebrity dies i go on @entity203 and you will see lots of different items available
" and of course , a star 's family can make money off of their likeness , " @entity174 added
" @entity214 , @entity203 's pop culture expert , said the site sees an uptick in items related to a celebrity after their death
@entity222 said the star does n't have to be someone who is popular at the moment
while her site was flooded with @entity46 memorabilia after his recent death , @entity222 said there has also been a great deal of interest generated by the sale of the crypt above the final resting place of @entity86 , who died almost 50 years ago
" [ a death ] clearly incites a buying and selling cycle in an accelerated fashion , " @entity222 said
" we see unique things pop up that are always capturing the public 's attention and there are people out there willing to buy them
" @entity247 counts himself among the death devotees
he proudly wears his " @entity250 " t - shirt , visits @entity251 -- where several stars are buried -- and blogs about old @entity251 on his web site " @entity255 in @entity15 " @entity247 said he loves learning the history behind the lives and deaths of celebrities , and understands the allure
" there is a definite fascination and people are drawn to it on many levels , " @entity247 said
" the fascination with death is that it 's a frightening thing , yet it is something you are curious about
so there 's that juxtaposition that makes it so interesting
" @entity46 's business has attracted some breathing celebrities
he said he 's even given @entity274 a tour
as the old saying goes , death is one of only two guarantees in life
and with the number of stars moving on these days , there could be more business opportunities for @entity9 and those in his industry
" @entity287 has been very generous to @entity288 , " @entity9 said , laughing .
