-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 is sending a special envoy to @entity4 following an escalation of violence in the world 's newest nation
ambassador @entity9 , the special envoy to @entity4 and @entity4 , headed to the area friday
" now is the time for @entity4 's leaders to rein in armed groups under their control , immediately cease attacks on civilians , and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups , " @entity1 said in a statement
" the violence must stop , the dialogue must intensify
" also on friday , national security adviser @entity23 recorded an audio message to the people to @entity4
" i ask each of you to make the choice for peace -- make the choice for a unified and cohesive @entity4 , " she said
" make this choice for yourselves and your children
" attackers killed two @entity38 army peacekeepers in @entity4 and wounded a third one in the chest , the @entity35 said friday
at least two of the 30 civilians who took refuge at the @entity35 ' @entity45 base were killed in the attack thursday , said @entity47 , the @entity35 spokesman for @entity4
it could have been as many as 20 who died in that attack @entity35 officials estimated
their remains will be taken to the capital of @entity55
deadly clashes have raged @entity4 for days after a reported coup attempt in the capital over the weekend president @entity59 blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president , @entity61 , for starting the violence
casualties are in the hundreds , including soldiers , the government said
the government of neighboring @entity67 will send troops into @entity4 to help evacuate 1,600 @entity67 citizens , presidential spokesman @entity65 said
an official from @entity4 's ruling party , who has just left the country , said the @entity2 is not doing enough
" there was a lot of presence of troops in the city
there was a lot of injured , displaced people
gunshots heard every two minutes , a lot is at stake , a lot needs to be done , " said @entity82 , chief of staff for the secretary general of the ruling @entity84
" president @entity89 made a statement and is dispatching a special envoy to the area
i believe that 's not enough
a lot of dialogue needs to be taking place
a lot of convincing needs to be taking place
" @entity89 sent 45 service members to @entity4 to support @entity2 personnel and the @entity103
" in 2011 , millions of @entity4 voted to forge a new nation , founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of @entity4 's people , " @entity89 said in a prepared statement
" in recent years , against great odds , @entity4 has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history
" today , that future is at risk
@entity4 stands at the precipice
recent fighting threatens to plunge @entity4 back into the dark days of its past , " the president said
tensions have been high in @entity4 since @entity59 dismissed his entire @entity121 , including @entity61 , in july
the move inflamed deep tensions between @entity126 's @entity125 community and @entity129 's @entity128 community
@entity35 officials have said they are worried the recent fighting is based on ethnic divisions , but the government has disputed that assertion
eleven people have been arrested in connection with the foiled coup @entity0 's @entity137 and @entity138 contributed to this report .
