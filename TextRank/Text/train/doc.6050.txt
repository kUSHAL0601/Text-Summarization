-- at the 1964 @entity2 , people stood in line for hours to look at a strange sight
if only the future looked like " @entity6 , " with its nifty gadgets that seem to solve every problem
they wanted to see the " @entity10 , " a miniaturized replica of a typical 21st century @entity13 city that featured moving sidewalks , computer - guided cars zipping along congestion - free highways and resort hotels beneath the sea
forty years later , we 're still waiting for those congestion - free highways -- along with the jet pack , the paperless office and all those " @entity6 " - like gadgets that were supposed to make 21st - century life so easy
@entity25 has been waiting as well
he 's looked at the future we imagined for ourselves in pulp comic books , old science magazines and cheesy sci - fi movies from the 1950s , and came up with one question
why is n't the future what it used to be ? " i feel entitled to have all this technology that 's been promised at a certain time , " says @entity25 , author of " where 's my jetpack ? " " i look up and say , ' where 's all this stuff ? ' '' some of that futuristic stuff , it turns out , is already here
visionaries actually invented objects like flying cars , but they could never work out the real world applications , @entity25 says
other inventions had the same problem
ordinary people did n't want to have anything to do with them
these futuristic follies include everything from " @entity51 , " an invention that helped moviegoers smell as well as see movies ; @entity56 's " ultrasonic ultra-squeaky clean human washing machine " ( it was dubbed the " human washing machine , " but would n't fit in an ordinary bathroom ) and , of course , the jet pack
" scientists are ok at predicting what technology is going to happen in the future , " @entity25 says
" they 're really bad at predicting how it 's going to affect us
" what happened to my jet pack ? the jet pack is a perfect example of predicting the future , @entity25 says
he says the jet pack first appeared in 1928 in an @entity74 comic book , which featured the hero @entity75 zooming though the sky in a jet pack
the jet pack was actually developed by 1961 , @entity25 says
an inventor mounted a rocket onto a backpack and called it a rocket belt
a variation of the rocket belt even appeared in the 1965 @entity86 movie , " @entity87
" today , the jet pack continues to grab inventors ' imaginations
a daredevil wearing a jet pack flew across a 1,500 - foot - wide canyon in @entity94 in november
a @entity96 pilot , dubbed " @entity97 , " flew across the @entity98 last year using a single jet - propelled wing
and a @entity101 inventor recently invented a jet pack , which weighs about 250 pounds , that reportedly can run for 30 minutes
the jet pack , though , has never really taken off , @entity25 says
the problem is its practical application
while a rocket belt could propel a screaming human to 60 mph in seconds , its fuel lasted for only about half a minute , " which led to more screaming , " @entity25 says
the military could n't find a useful application for it either
a soldier with a jet pack might look cool , but he 's an easy target
nor could a jet pack be of use to ordinary people who wanted to avoid rush - hour traffic , @entity25 says
jet - packing hordes could transform the skies into an aerial demolition derby , with air rage and drunk drivers turned into wobbly human torpedoes
yet other bold visions of the future have come true
remember @entity130 the robot ? that was the name of the robotic maid that waited on the @entity135 , the popular cartoon family from the future
@entity130 has become " @entity138
" that 's the name of a 3 - foot - tall robot with a goofy grin that the @entity143 conglomerate in @entity144 invented to assist elderly people at home by doing everything from reminding them to take their medicine to looking out for burglars
wakamaru can recognize faces and up to 10,000 words , @entity25 says
" @entity156 , " is a tagline from another television show , " @entity6 "
but teleportation has been invented , @entity25 says
he says a group of international scientists successfully transported a photon -- a bundle of electromagnetic energy -- from one side of a room to another in 1993
physicists routinely conduct teleportation experiments today , @entity25 says
" teleporting anything , even elementary particles , is mind - blowing , " @entity25 says
" why is it that most people do n't know it exists ? it has n't been put into practice yet
in real life , it 's always about , ' what can you do for me ? ' " a darker view of technology 's future people 's fascination with technology 's imprint on the future did n't start , however , in the mid- 20th century with shows like " @entity135 " or " @entity6
" @entity190 , co-author of " yesterday 's tomorrows : past @entity201 , " found an inflated optimism about technology 's impact on the future as far back as the 19th century , when writers like @entity197 ( " @entity198 " ) were creating wondrous versions of the future
even then , people had a misplaced faith in the power of inventions to make life easier , @entity190 says
for example , the typical 19th - century @entity13 city was crowded and smelly
they created traffic jams , filled the streets with their droppings and , when they died , their carcasses
but around the turn of the 20th century , @entity13 were predicting that another miraculous invention would deliver them from the burden of the horse and hurried urban life -- the automobile , @entity190 says
" there were a lot of predictions associated with early automobiles , " @entity190 says
" they would help eliminate congestion in the city and the messy , unsanitary streets of the city
" @entity190 says @entity13 ' faith in the power of technology to reshape the future is due in part to their history
@entity13 have never accepted a radical political transformation that would change their future
they prefer technology , not radical politics , to propel social change
" technology has been seen by many @entity13 as a way to get a better tomorrow without having to deal with revolutionary change , " @entity190 says
today , however , a more sober view of technology has sneaked into the nation 's popular culture
in dystopian sci - fi films like " @entity251 , " and " @entity252 , " technology creates more problems than it solves
" @entity255 , '' the recent television series , is a prime example
it depicts a world where human beings have created amazing technology that has brought them to the precipice of extinction
there 's no @entity75 zooming blissfully through the sky
the show follows the journey of a group of humans who created a race of robots called @entity271
the @entity273 rebel , virtually wipe out humanity with nuclear weapons , and pursue the survivors through space
@entity278 , a @entity255 writer , says the show 's writers pay attention to current events when plotting their story lines
the contemporary world is filled with the unintended consequences of technology , he says
" there are so many things you ca n't anticipate when you create a new technology , " he says
" who would have predicted that the @entity292 would be taking down shopping malls and wiping out newspapers ? '' in @entity255 's finale , human beings abandon their faith in technology 's ability to improve the future
they destroy their fancy machines and start again as simple hunter - gatherers
" at some point , you ca n't expect a miracle to come in the form of technology to save us , " @entity278 says
" at some point , the miracle has to come from a change in attitude and a new outlook
" that does n't mean , however , that @entity278 is n't a fan of imagining future technology
he says he grew up watching " @entity6 " and immersing himself in @entity10 - like exhibits
the elevated cities and the " @entity6 " voyages of yesteryear may now seem corny , but at least they show humanity has a future , he says
" ' @entity6 ' was saying [ that ] a thousand years from now , people [ will ] figure out how to get along , " @entity278 says
" in some ways , sci - fi says that the future is still optimistic , because no matter how bleak things are , it suggests that we 're still here
