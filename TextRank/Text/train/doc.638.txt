@entity0 -- once relegated to sleazy red - light districts and the darker corners of the @entity5 , porn stars are now gaining followings in a surprising place : @entity8
they are using the social media site to engage directly with their fans and build their individual brands " @entity8 has opened up these porn stars fan bases like nothing the adult film industry has ever seen before , " said @entity14 , managing editor of @entity15 , an adult industry trade publication
" since most mainstream pop culture publications do n't cover the porn industry ( and ) porn movie reviews do n't generally appear alongside reviews of big @entity26 movies ... the adult industry has embraced @entity8 as a way to reach out directly to fans beyond the typical porn consumer
" @entity14 estimates that 90 % of porn performers are on @entity8 , and he believes it is essential for new performers to use social media effectively to promote themselves and build their " brand
" porn stars showcase all - american success ? " if you 're not on @entity8 , you are definitely at a disadvantage right out of the gate , " he said
@entity43 was one of the first executives in the adult entertainment business to embrace social media , first on @entity47 , then @entity48 and now on @entity8
" @entity56 our social media platforms like @entity8 i 'm trying to establish brand loyalty , like people have for a company like @entity58 , " said @entity43 , a social media strategist at @entity50 , an adult movie production company
@entity43 holds seminars for adult movie actors , helping them set up their accounts and guiding them on how to tweet in a way that will connect them to their audience by engaging directly with fans and showing some of their personal sides to their followers
" i try to instill in performers that you should let people know who you are , invite them into your interaction , " he said
@entity43 begins his work day by logging onto @entity8 to gauge reaction from the fans to his company 's movies and performers
if viewers of a new movie trailer tweet that there is too much emphasis on male characters , @entity43 will make a call to the edit department asking for changes
" @entity8 is like an instant focus group , " explained @entity43
" it 's not going to go away , it is the future
from our company 's point of view , it 's pure customer service
" social media is profoundly changing the porn business , according to @entity96 , a visiting scholar at @entity97 who studies the porn industry
" before it was about pure fantasy : you did n't have enough information to be real fans of performers , " she said
" but now you can become a true fan of a porn star
" the performers who are successful on @entity8 are the ones who open themselves up and share parts of their non-professional life with fans , allowing followers a window into their off - camera personalities
" that kind of interaction is something you do n't see mainstream celebrities doing to the same degree , " according to @entity122
" you do n't see @entity123 tweeting directly to people
" many of the performers are surprisingly funny , smart and engaging on @entity8
while they all promote their movies , most focus more on their hobbies , current events and personal lives
" you are seeing a different kind of relationship that a viewer has with a porn performer , " @entity96 said
" one of the things that comes with social media is the deconstruction of stereotypes
" social media has the power to change how the public views porn stars , according to @entity122 , and it may ultimately make porn more mainstream and socially acceptable
here are several adult film stars who are using @entity8 to attract a wider audience : putting your ' erotic capital ' to work the @entity148 @entity149 is arguably the hottest male performer in the porn industry
at 26 years old , he has already appeared in over 1,200 movies
he has made a name for himself by defying stereotypes about male porn stars : he comes off as a funny , slightly goofy boy - next - door
his non-threatening demeanor has made his films popular with younger woman and has led him to more mainstream opportunities
@entity149 is currently working on a @entity26 movie called " @entity160 , " in which he is co-starring with @entity161
the film is directed by @entity163 , who is known for writing " @entity164 , " " @entity165 " and " @entity166
" the movie is slated to premier in 2013
@entity149 credits @entity8 with helping his transition to mainstream films
" i think a lot of the mainstream thing has to do with @entity8 , " he told @entity1
" people look at me and they say , ' he 's not a porn star , he 's just a nice guy
" his approach to @entity8 is simple : be yourself
" i like to keep my @entity8 very personal and used as a random outlet for my feelings , " @entity149 said
" i see no reason to be involved except to be myself
" despite his non-commercial approach to @entity8 , he said being an effective tweeter is an essential part of his business
" the way the world is going , you have to be able to communicate with your market , know about your demographic , know what people are clicking on and then communicate back to them , " @entity149 said
the @entity5 's girlfriend : @ danadearmond @entity193 describes herself as a " pornographer of the people " and is one of the most accessible adult performers on @entity8
she responds to most of her followers who post a comment or question , often with a smart - alecky remark
" people like to laugh and they like to know that people who are sex workers can also be smart and funny , " said @entity193 , who occasionally performs stand - up comedy around @entity202
@entity193 , 33 , says the porn world is extremely competitive and she uses @entity8 to differentiate herself from other performers by interacting directly with her fans
" i 've developed the moniker ' the @entity5 's girlfriend ' and tried to make a more personal connection with the people who found me and followed me , " she said
. " it 's something i 've used in my branding
it 's like ' ok , if you do n't have a real girlfriend you can pretend i 'm your girlfriend on the @entity5 and i wo n't treat you like a customer
' that 's how i brand myself
" @entity193 describes the porn industry as an " ever - changing animal " : viewers ' relationship with the product and their expectations of the performers are " constantly evolving and now requires a much more personal approach by performers
" " @entity227 is not a utilitarian thing ; if it were there would already have been enough porn made forever , " she said
" people have a connection to it and @entity8 helps me make that connection
" the @entity235 in @entity227 : @ @entity236 perhaps the most surprising porn figure to emerge on @entity8 is @entity238
with her dyed blonde hair and pouty lips she certainly looks the part of an adult film star
when she 's not making porn movies , @entity238 tweets about her very non-pornographic passions : books and horses
" people seem to be surprised with the things i 'm into , " she told @entity1
she often tweets about her favorite authors , @entity251 and @entity252
between shoots in the @entity254 , she travels to @entity255 where she is taking a series of writing classes with legendary editor @entity258 , noted for his work with authors @entity261 and @entity263
" the porn people could care less who i 'm reading , " @entity238 said
" i have a slim sliver of fans based on a common passion for books and the written word
those are who i interact with
" she is working on a novel set in the world of porn and posts essays on her website and tweets them out to her followers
" if you 're interacting with people , you 're putting part of your soul into it , " she said
" the people that understand me the best are people into writing
" back in @entity202 , @entity238 enjoys spending time with her horses
in april , her mare @entity290 gave birth and @entity238 tweeted throughout the process , posting pictures and even asking her followers to help name the foal
despite the situation having nothing to do with her porn life , her @entity8 followers were with her all the way , tweeting congratulations and piping in with suggestions for names
she ultimately settled on the name @entity307
although many of her tweets are on her hobbies , @entity238 says that @entity8 has been the key to her success in the porn world
" i was largely unsuccessful up until @entity8 came along because i 'm very shy ... and it came through in my movies , " she said
" but with @entity8 , people see a different side of me and they see it in my movies
" @entity8 allows @entity238 to defy people 's preconceived notions of what porn stars are like and be more comfortable both on camera and off
" @entity8 has made me more confident as a person and a performer , " she said .
