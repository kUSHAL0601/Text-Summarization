-- @entity1 has revealed she is not in love with playing tennis , despite an impressive straight sets victory on her return to action at the @entity8 tournament
playing in her first match since losing the @entity11 final to @entity12 in september , @entity1 brushed aside @entity14 @entity13 6 - 2 6 - 3 with consummate ease
the 30 - year - old @entity16 , who is seeded fourth in @entity17 , fired down seven aces in a 68 - minute victory -- but later told reporters that she will cut back her schedule even further in 2012
@entity22 returns with convincing victory " i just want to be able to do other things that i 'm doing and expand on that
i think that helps keep my motivation up , " said the 13 - time grand slam winner
" i do n't love tennis today but i 'm here
i ca n't live without it -- there 's a difference between not loving something and not being able to live without it
" it 's not that i 've fallen out of love with it
i 've actually never liked sports and i never understood how i became an athlete , " @entity1 continued
" i do n't like working out , i do n't like anything physical
if it involves sitting down or shopping , i 'm excellent at it
" in other matches , top seed and local favorite @entity12 beat @entity46 of @entity47 6 - 2 6 - 3 and is on course to face @entity1 again in the semifinals
second seed @entity50 of @entity52 defeated @entity54 @entity53 7 - 6 1 - 6 6 - 3 , while former world number one @entity55 saw off @entity57 @entity56 6 - 3 6 - 3 and now faces @entity22 .
