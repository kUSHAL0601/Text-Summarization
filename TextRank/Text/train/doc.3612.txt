@entity0 -- the @entity2 , as promised , moved tuesday to block a court ruling preventing use of government funds for embryonic stem cell research
the lower - court decision that bars the use of publicly funded stem - cell work had stunned the @entity11 administration , which had vowed to appeal
" the government is seeking a stay of the court 's injunction to prevent the irreparable human and financial harm that could occur if these life - saving research projects are forced to abruptly shut down , " said @entity2 spokeswoman @entity12
" the court 's order causes irrevocable harm to the millions of extremely sick or injured people who stand to benefit from continuing research as well as to the taxpayers who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this research , " a @entity2 statement said
the justice lawyers filed the notice of appeal and the proposed stay with @entity33 district court judge @entity32 , who had granted the injunction sought by plaintiffs opposed to research in which embryos had been destroyed
" we 've said from day one that embryonic stem cell research is a top priority for this administration , and we 're going to do everything possible to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of this injunction , " said @entity39 spokesman @entity38
the government said if @entity32 has not granted the stay by september 7 , the government would " present their stay request to the @entity48 the following day "
in that event , a three - judge panel of the @entity33 @entity53 for the @entity0 , would likely rule quickly on the request for a stay , while it schedules briefs and arguments on the legal merits of the case which may take months
government lawyers filed the appeal on behalf of @entity65 secretary @entity64 , the @entity66 , and its director , @entity67
@entity67 said @entity66 has invested over $ 546 million in taxpayers ' money in human embryonic stem cell research since 2001
in a 12 - page statement attached to the appeal , @entity67 said the court order prevents @entity66 from providing $ 54 million in funds to 24 human embryonic research projects currently under way that were expecting to receive funds within the next month
he said another 199 grants would be discontinued for projects which were to be awarded funding after the september 30 deadline ordered by the court
judge @entity32 had ruled that all embryonic stem - cell research involves destroying embryos
he said a provision of federal spending bills " unambiguously prohibits the use of federal funds for all research in which a human embryo is destroyed "
the legal arguments with which @entity32 sided were brought by researchers opposed to use of embryonic stem cells
plaintiffs included a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization , the non-profit @entity100 and others
