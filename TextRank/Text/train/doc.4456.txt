dr. @entity0 , dubbed the " @entity1 " of @entity2 , will return to the late night airwaves friday , three months after his show " @entity7 " was kicked off the air in his home country
@entity0 made the announcement via his @entity10 account and a @entity12 video
the new program , originating in @entity14 and airing on @entity15 at 10 p.m. fridays , will retain the name of his old program , which was dropped by @entity18 after @entity0 's satire offended supporters of @entity2 gen. @entity22 @entity21
when @entity18 terminated " @entity7 , " it raised questions about freedom of speech in @entity2 under @entity21 , the country 's de facto leader since the ousting of president @entity28 on july 3
ironically , @entity0 came to prominence with his show 's satiric look at politics following the 2011 @entity33 , and he thrived while @entity28 was in charge
@entity28 and 14 other defendants are on trial , facing charges of inciting murder at the @entity39 in december 2012
in court on saturday , @entity28 's lawyer said he is still technically the president since he did n't resign , he was never officially overthrown and the decision to remove him was n't published in the official gazette
@entity28 's attorney said constitutional law regulates how the president should be treated in court
the case was adjourned until tuesday .
