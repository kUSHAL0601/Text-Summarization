so reports of the death of 21 - year - old cast member @entity4 on monday hit fans hard
@entity4 was happy with life before death " i still can not get over the fact that @entity4 died he was my favorite , " tweeted one fan named @entity21
# @entity4 " the series , which follows a group of young people as they have fun in @entity29 , @entity30 , was controversial before it even aired
many believed the show would fill the void of the wildly successful " @entity34 , " which featured plenty of drunken shenanigans , hookups and fights
before " @entity4 " premiered , sen. @entity39 , @entity40 , sent @entity3 a letter calling it a " travesty
" " this show plays to ugly , inaccurate stereotypes about the people of @entity30 , " he wrote
@entity45 , the executive producer of the show , countered that the series was actually unlike any others on television , as the " @entity4 " bunch 's idea of a good time was more hanging out in the woods than on @entity53 or @entity54
" [ @entity56 ] t 's not like looking at a train wreck
... there is a certain coolness to it , " @entity45 told @entity58
" it 's different than a lot of the stuff that has been produced
i think it 's going to get people talking and it might change people 's perspectives
these kids are totally wild and carefree
it will be very refreshing to the @entity3 audience
" in reviewing the show , the @entity73 said it " follows a slew of wild , drunken @entity76 in their late teens and early 20s
" " not only is it another tired portrayal of @entity81 stereotypes , but it 's also inexcusably poorly executed , " the review said
" the six girls and three boys ( trouble is sure to brew with those odds ) stumble through and stiffly carry out their force - fed cues
" @entity87 was a bit more forgiving
" sure , watching them might be amusing fun ( i ca n't wait to see that insane lady in the red wig yell at them ) but it 's never going to be as good as ' @entity34 , ' no matter how wild it purports to be , " the website said
despite the lackluster reviews , @entity3 recently renewed the show for a second season
on " @entity4 , " @entity4 was shown as a charming @entity81 guy who early on competed with fellow castmate @entity101 for the affections of @entity103
@entity4 noted that he lived in a community surrounded by relatives ( " they call it a holler ' cause when you holler , everybody can hear ya " ) and in a sneak peek of the show , his mother , @entity104 , is shown expressing how much her son loved his job hauling trash
