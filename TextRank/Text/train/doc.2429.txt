sen. @entity0 , one of the @entity2 's leading doves , said tuesday he does n't want the @entity3 leading the fight against @entity5
instead , said the @entity8 senator , who is eyeing a 2016 presidential bid , the nation should be focused on helping the middle class
@entity0 , an @entity11 who caucuses with @entity13 , said he does n't want to see the @entity3 fall into another " quagmire in the @entity15 , " and he put the onus on @entity18 countries to take on @entity5
" i 'm sitting here wondering where @entity22 is , where @entity23 is , where @entity25 is , " @entity0 said on @entity20 's " @entity19
" " i 'll be damned if kids in the state of @entity8 -- or taxpayers in the state of @entity8 -- have to defend the royal @entity22 family , which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars
" @entity22 and @entity25 are part of a five - country coalition of @entity15 nations that have joined the @entity3 in airstrikes against @entity5 in @entity38 , but @entity0 suggested the @entity3 should only be " supportive
" @entity0 also joined 21 other senators earlier this month in opposing a resolution to train and arm 5,000 moderate @entity38 rebels to combat @entity5
" it can not be won and it will not be won by the @entity3 alone , " @entity0 said of the war on @entity5
and like a candidate running for office , @entity0 , who is not up for reelection this fall , quickly shifted the interview away from whether the @entity2 should declare war to the plight of the middle class and increasing income inequality
" while we focus all of our attention on @entity5 , the middle class in this country continues to collapse , " @entity0 said
" and you know what the people tell me in @entity8 and around the country ? let 's also start paying attention to the crises facing working families in @entity3
" instead of a war resolution , @entity0 rattled off a list of progressive initiatives he does " want to vote on , " including raising the minimum wage and creating a national jobs program
@entity0 calls for ' political revolution ' in @entity69 @entity0 traveled to @entity69 earlier this month on what he has described as a listening tour to gauge the appetite for what would be a populist campaign for the presidency
" i 'm going around the country getting an assessment from the @entity3 people as to whether or not there would be support for a campaign that in fact takes on the @entity84 brothers , takes on the billionaire class , " @entity0 said .
