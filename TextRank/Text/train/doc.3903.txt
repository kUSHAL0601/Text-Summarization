@entity0 's 22 months in solitary confinement in a county jail left him traumatized and physically weak , but he 'll soon be a multimillionaire for his suffering
the @entity5 county that locked him up on a drunk driving charge , isolated him from other inmates and accused of essentially forgetting about him for nearly two years agreed this week to settle his lawsuit for $ 15.5 million
@entity0 , now 59 , went to jail in august 2005 as " a well nourished , physically healthy adult , " but emerged with a long beard , bed sores , bad teeth and weighing just 133 pounds in june 2007 , according to the lawsuit
jailers separated @entity0 from other inmates because of his history of mental illness , according to the lawsuit filed by @entity21 civil rights attorney @entity20 in december 2008
the charges of driving while intoxicated and receiving a stolen vehicle were never prosecuted
" they threw him in solitary and then ignored him , " said @entity20 a year ago after a federal jury awarded @entity0 $ 22 million
" he disappeared into delirium , and his mental illness was made worse by being isolated from human contact and a lack of medical care
" @entity0 suffers from post-traumatic stress from what he called physical and mental mistreatment by corrections officials in @entity37 , which shares a border with @entity5 in the southern part of the state
the county 's commissioners agreed this week to drop their appeal of the jury 's verdict in return for @entity0 accepting the lesser amount
" the @entity50 deeply regrets the harm mr. @entity0 suffered during this period , " the county said in a statement thursday
" over the past seven years , @entity37 has made significant improvements to detention center staffing , training , facilities and procedures
@entity37 is committed to ensuring consistent and appropriate treatment of every detainee in its care
" @entity0 's lawsuit alleged he became malnourished , lost significant weight , developed bedsores , fungus and dental problems and was not aware of his situation or surroundings
he was transferred to another state facility for two weeks , given a psychiatric evaluation and then sent back to the @entity70 , where he was again placed in solitary confinement
@entity20 said @entity0 did receive a brief competency hearing a year into his imprisonment , but the case against the man never proceeded
after 22 months as a pretrial detainee , @entity0 was released and the charges dismissed
he then filed suit , claiming his rights of due process were violated since he was not given a hearing before being placed in solitary confinement
photos taken before and after his confinement show dramatic appearance changes
the plaintiff said things were so bad he was forced to pull his own tooth while in custody , and that his pleas for help were dismissed
in pretrial motions , the county denied " that there was lack of medical care
for most of the other allegations , officials either denied them or said they were " without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief " of the veracity of the claims
@entity20 told @entity104 he and @entity0 hope their victory would " help bring a stop to the use of solitary confinement in @entity108
other countries recognize it as a form of torture , whereas @entity108 uses it as a routine method of incarceration
" " the families and friends of the people who have been subjected to this barbaric treatment know what we are talking about , " @entity20 wrote in an e-mail
" they see the effects of it every day
@entity127 's story can make a difference to them and others who are currently sitting in a concrete cell 23 hours a day
" the county said it has taken " bold steps " to improve the 846 - bed jail , which it said would make it " the model for detention centers and the care of the mentally ill in the state of @entity5
" " in the wake of this large settlement , we can say definitively that we have learned from the past , " its statement said
" we can also say with confidence that we are leading the way for the future
" @entity0 continues to have serious medical issues , and is fighting lung cancer , his lawyer said
" @entity127 is optimistic in his ongoing battle with cancer and is doing as well as can be expected while undergoing some pretty difficult treatments , " @entity20 wrote
" mentally , he will always suffer the effects of his inhumane treatment at the hands of @entity37
the money can never replace what they took from him
