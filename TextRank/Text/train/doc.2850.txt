-- the death of longtime @entity3 dictator @entity2 is shaking the @entity5 world
and nations like @entity7 , which next month holds its first parliamentary elections since the fall of president @entity10 in february , are watching
@entity7 , like @entity11 -- which holds elections this weekend -- needs a great many positive influences to consolidate its nascent democratic government
if @entity3 's @entity15 should turn in a militant @entity17 direction and become hostile to the @entity18 or the @entity19 , it could jeopardize democratic progress in @entity21 and @entity22 alike
@entity7 's position is precarious enough as it is
two weeks ago in @entity22 , for example , @entity25 protesters clashed with security forces , leaving 25 dead and more than 300 injured
the violence stems from the @entity30 ' refusal to share key decision - making powers with civilians and tests its ability to manage the country 's fragile political transition
today in @entity7 , no political faction is strong enough to monopolize power and none is weak enough to be ground out of existence
as a result , the army 's failure to build a solid political consensus creates a recipe for ongoing confrontation
as long as @entity7 believe they stand to gain more through violence than peaceful political negotiations , the situation in @entity22 will worsen
three decades ago , after the @entity50 in @entity51 , the @entity49 wasted no time in enacting a brutal purge of the country 's secular military elites , whom he feared would endanger his rule
in refusing to establish a new order that @entity7 's most powerful political constituencies can all get behind , the @entity7 army may now be leading itself in the same direction
the army 's stubbornness in refusing to craft a new constitution before holding elections at the end of november is ill - considered and dangerous
the coming parliament will be charged with choosing 100 experts to draft the new constitution
but @entity69 and secularists fear that an @entity17 - dominated parliament will produce a constitution that discriminates against them
having had little more than six months of freedom , most @entity7 political parties are still in their infancy , and the older secular parties are not yet ready for elections
@entity17 parties are the best prepared , as they have been well funded , are known across the country and have enjoyed most of the coverage in the state - owned media since the fall of @entity10
yet secularists -- who constitute 70 % or perhaps 80 % of @entity7 's political parties -- asked for more time to prepare for elections and for the military to facilitate an agreement on a bill of rights that sets down guiding principles for the new constitution
islamists oppose such a move , as they fear it would create rules the secularists could use to oppress them
as a provisional government , the army must create a new political framework that guarantees majority rule while protecting the rights of religious , ethnic and political minorities
yet in spite of a worsening domestic situation , the military shows no such desire
after @entity10 's fall , @entity7 hoped the army would be the guarantor of a democratic transition ; that it would do this transparently , sharing power with civilian political groups , and presiding over a convention culminating in a modern , democratic constitution that protects every @entity7 individual and political group that rejects violence
in late july , the @entity30 sent a worrisome signal when it celebrated @entity116 , the anniversary of the 1952 coup d'etat in which the military took power
this coup smothered @entity7 's nascent democratic process in its cradle and ushered in an era of military rule lasting almost six decades
after the coup , military men in civilian attire rigged every election , abused human rights and monopolized the political system
in years past , @entity116 was nothing out of the ordinary -- the country had celebrated it every year for almost six decades -- but this year , it signaled the military 's intention to backpedal on political reforms and maintain an undemocratic status quo
the 1952 regime has hidden behind many different ideologies and adopted a range of different national and international alliances to suit its needs
it began as a capitalist government , allied with the @entity146 , turned to @entity147 and became socialist in the 1960s , then adopted a mixture of socialism and capitalism in the late ' 70s , and allied itself with @entity152
yet in no incarnation was the military - backed regime ever democratic
until @entity7 's rulers reject the order established in the 1952 military coup , the country will never move forward toward genuine democracy
ongoing protests and rising violence are not a coincidence
they are the fruits of 60 years of failed policies
if @entity7 could be confident in their political futures -- that they would be subject to the rule of law rather than the rule of man -- they would be less frustrated
if they could be sure that the country 's new political order would respect their individual rights and liberties , they would no longer be in the streets
if a new constitution ensured that @entity181 , @entity69 , secularists , men and women alike all enjoyed equal rights , then maybe violence and protests would not be the way to be heard
if the @entity30 respected its mandate to establish the rules of the game , and then shared power with political parties , @entity7 would be confident that it sought only to preserve rule of law and public order , not to perpetuate its own rule
@entity7 military elites can take comfort that they will not meet the same end as @entity2 , nor that of the @entity51 military after the fall of the shah
but they should take the latest violence very seriously , as they are in a far more delicate position than they may realize
they can not continue to manage the country 's transition the way that they have
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .
