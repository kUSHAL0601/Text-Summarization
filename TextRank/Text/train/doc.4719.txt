for years , the protocol for treating possible concussions on a football field has been this : after a player takes a hard hit to the head , a coach or trainer examines him to assess the severity of the impact and his readiness to return to the field
but a visual inspection only reveals so much
what if there were data that could help detect concussions in real time ? now there are
a wave of new technology , embedded in football helmets , aims to measure the force of on - field collisions and send alerts when a player 's health may be in danger
" we want to protect players as best we can , " said @entity29 , head of product development and management at @entity32 , the @entity34 ' leading maker of football helmets , which has embraced these new head - impact systems
" it 's a way of keeping your players healthy
you can keep your star player healthy , and keep your star player playing more , " he said
" that 's the way i 'd look at it if i was a coach
" head injuries in football have become a hot - button issue in recent years , from youth leagues to the @entity52
thousands of former pro players -- many with dementia , alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease and other brain disorders -- have sued the @entity52 , claiming the league knew about the long - term health risks associated with head trauma
@entity32 , whose helmets were worn by two - thirds of @entity52 players last season , was named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits
meanwhile , more parents are voicing concerns about letting their sons play football amid a study suggesting that high school athletes are more vulnerable to concussions than older players
" ten or 15 years ago concussions were n't thought of the same way as they are now , " @entity29 said
" they 're being taken much more seriously ... and not just shrugged off as ' being shook up ' on the field
" seeing an opportunity , manufacturers are producing a growing list of products marketed as " head impact sensors , " small devices that fit inside the helmet and trigger a warning when a player sustains an especially hard blow
these products have names like @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity96 's @entity95 , and they 're pitched as an extra set of eyes on the playing field
now @entity32 is looking to incorporate such sensors into the helmet itself
the company 's newest helmet , the @entity105 , is the first designed from the ground up to include a polymer - film lining that develops a charge when impact pressure is applied
the helmet 's crown contains a flexible panel that compresses upon impact , reducing the force of collisions
meanwhile , the helmet can be fitted with sensors -- @entity32 's @entity119 system , launched last year -- that send wireless alerts to handheld devices on the sidelines , telling coaches when a player has sustained an unusually forceful hit , or series of hits , to the head
when equipped this way , the helmet is " an information - gathering tool , " said @entity29 , who tests helmets at @entity32 's lab in @entity135 , @entity136 , outside @entity137
a @entity32 spokeswoman said the @entity105 helmet will hit the market this summer in time for the 2014 football season
such impact - sensing technology is not without controversy , however
tests of head - impact sensors , conducted last year before @entity146 cameras , have suggested potential problems
some helmets fitted with the sensors failed to register alerts even after being dropped from five feet or higher , an impact that could easily cause a concussion
doctors have expressed concerns that inaccurate sensors could give players a false sense of security
" these technologies can be useful if used cautiously , as long as you do n't overinterpret what they mean , " dr. @entity159 , director of the @entity161 clinic , said last year
" it could be really dangerous to rely on this too much
" @entity32 and other manufacturers are quick to point out that their products do n't diagnose concussions or any other injury
they say their devices do give coaches and trainers additional criteria that can help in determining whether a player should come out of a game
@entity29 believes the @entity105 helmet will have additional safety benefits
" it could help identify players that are striking their head too often
a lot of multiple - impact alerts probably means a player is using their head more than they should , and there 's probably an opportunity to coach them not to do that , " he said
" and that in the end can protect them better
it can make the game safer
