crowds in a @entity2 town surrounded by government troops cheered @entity5 monitors who visited sunday as others fled the town on foot to escape the fighting inside
residents of @entity11 , about 50 km ( 30 miles ) northwest of @entity12 , lifted one of the monitors onto their shoulders and passed him around the crowd during sunday 's visit
they told @entity17 that their water and electricity had been cut off for the past three days , and they showed off wounds they said had been inflicted by pro-government forces
the monitors got a different reception from @entity2 soldiers , who berated them as the soldiers carried off the body of one of their comrades they said had been shot by opposition forces
the visit came as another 32 people were killed by government troops trying to crush a 10 - month - old uprising against the rule of president @entity35 , according to the @entity36 , an opposition umbrella group
the toll included 13 in @entity38 , the scene of some of the worst fighting to date ; 10 in the city of @entity43 ; and three people , inlcuding a child , in @entity46
during a visit to neighboring @entity50 , @entity48 @entity47 ban ki - moon delivered a blunt message to @entity35 : " stop killing your people
" meanwhile , @entity35 announced that he was granting amnesty to anti-government demonstrators for " all crimes committed " since the uprising began last march , @entity2 state - run media reported
in @entity11 , a @entity17 crew heading into the city with the @entity5 monitors saw men , women and children trudging out of the city to get away from the fighting
when the monitors prepared to leave , many of the thousands who greeted the monitors in town urged them to stay , warning that attacks by government troops would resume once they left
some offered to show the monitors where @entity2 tanks were hidden in the fields surrounding the city
@entity2 was required to pull heavy weaponry out of the cities under the agreement its signed with the @entity5 in november , but @entity11 residents said the tanks pulled back only when the monitors were on their way
@entity83 , an @entity36 spokesman , said about 100 armored vehicles had surrounded the city for three days , and that power and water had been cut off as the city faced sub-freezing temperatures
a member of the @entity91 -- composed mostly of deserters who are siding with the opposition -- said there were about 70 lightly armed fighters in the city
the fighter asked not to be named for security reasons
" the situation is very bad
the siege is choking us , and even air is running out , " the fighter said , adding that fighters were setting up roadblocks to try to keep government forces out of residential areas
on their way out of town , the monitors were held up at a checkpoint on the outskirts of @entity11 for about an hour and a half as occasional bullets whizzed by
during that time , @entity2 troops carried off the body of a fellow soldier who had just been shot and turned their anger on the monitors
" is this what you want ? " one asked
" is this what the world wants ? is this a free @entity2 ? " more gunfire erupted as the monitors left town , and a soldier at another checkpoint rushed out to hammer at their vehicle
more than 5,000 people have died since mid-march , the @entity48 has said
opposition groups put the toll at more than 6,000
@entity134 , who has characterized the anti-government protesters as " armed gangs , " says his security forces are battling terrorists intent on targeting civilians and fomenting unrest
his latest amnesty decree follows the recent release of 5,000 prisoners by the @entity2 government under its agreement with the @entity5
it grants grants general amnesty for crimes committed between march 15 , 2011 , and january 15 , 2012 , according to the state - run @entity150
the decree applies to people who engaged in peaceful demonstrations , carried or possesses unlicensed weapons or ammunition and draft evaders , @entity150 said
fugitives must hand themselves in by the end of the month to benefit from the amnesty , the agency reported
it is the second time @entity35 has granted a general amnesty to protesters , who have been calling for an end to the regime
but reports of carnage mount every day , despite the presence of @entity5 observers in the country and international calls for a halt to the crackdown
" today , i say again to president @entity176 : stop the violence
stop killing your people , " @entity178 said at a conference on political reform and democracy in @entity182
" the path of repression is a dead end
" @entity17 can not verify accounts of what is happening in @entity2 because the government restricts the activity of journalists
a number of journalists have been allowed in to the country in recent days , including a @entity17 correspondent , to travel with @entity5 monitors
the @entity5 mission began december 26 and is expected to conclude on january 19
it has been mired in controversy from the start , from the choice to head the mission -- lt. gen. @entity203 , once the head of @entity205 's military intelligence -- to reports that the @entity2 government was limiting the group 's access .
