as we mark @entity5 this year , it 's worth asking : can @entity6 handle either one ? when @entity8 became president of @entity10 after the end of apartheid he had two choices
he could have gone down a path of confrontation and retribution against the white @entity17 who had ruled so oppressively
or he could have skipped quickly past the history and reality of apartheid and pardoned all its perpetrators in the interests of maintaining order
in one of his many acts of civic genius , he chose a path for his country that exposed the ugliness of the past and only then invited forgiveness
his government launched a @entity33 , led by archbishop @entity34
the commission gathered public testimony across the land , naming the institutional structures and individual acts that had brutalized blacks
no perpetrator was granted amnesty without a candid accounting of his or her deeds
the opportunity for restorative justice gave every participant a sense of heightened responsibility -- a chance to be bigger citizens , together
only then could reconciliation begin
and though the commission was not sufficient to " solve race " in post-apartheid @entity10 , it was still necessary
without such an attempt at formal accounting , without such an opportunity for oppressed and oppressor to face one another , that nation 's challenges would be even greater today
for proof , consider our own nation 150 years post-slavery
for a fleeting while after the @entity67 , we tried @entity69
freedmen could earn wages and vote freely and claim an equal place in politics
then we gave up on @entity69
and @entity74 came along to make black citizens second - class and to ensure that neither truth - telling nor reconciliation would be on the agenda
consider our nation 50 years post-civil rights movement
that movement is sometimes called the @entity82
it sought to finish the fight to make truly equal citizens out of the descendants of slaves
but here we are today , still plagued @entity88 and @entity89 by divisions of color and caste -- and by an inability to talk about them without angry defensiveness
that 's why it 's worth asking whether the @entity6 today could take a page from @entity10 's script
@entity100 , a civil rights attorney and restorative justice activist in @entity102 , @entity103 , has proposed just that
in a widely circulated essay in @entity106 ! @entity107 , @entity100 argues that @entity108 , @entity109 , needs a @entity33 on extrajudicial violence against african - americans -- and that @entity6 does , too
you can hear the objections already
for instance : wo n't cataloging acts of racism from the past just make it harder for us all to get along ? but of course , racism is not only in the past
it did not end with the @entity123 of 1865 or with the @entity124
it is present in the acts and attitudes of many today
it is present in the institutional residue of past choices
that the phrase # @entity132 must be said says it all
the criminal justice system , the education system , the economic system and ( as this year 's so - white @entity138 remind us ) the pop culture system -- all of them value black lives , black voices and black experience less than fully
we must all face that fact
there 's also this objection to a commission : that by racializing everything it would basically be racist
consider the words of @entity153 chief justice @entity152 , who , arguing against affirmative action , once wrote that " [ t ] he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race
" this tidy tautology flattens out history
it obliterates the difference between injury and remedy
it wants to rush us along to a " colorblindness " that our society has n't yet earned and perhaps should n't even seek as an ideal
as a @entity176 , i am an inheritor of what white people wrote in the @entity179 and what they did to subvert it
i am the beneficiary of what black people and people of every color have done to redeem the @entity179
i am sometimes the object of a presumption that yellow people are presumed foreign until proven otherwise
i own the good , the bad and the ugly of this country
none of this is neat
none of it is colorblind either
ultimately the deepest objection to a racial truth and reconciliation process in @entity6 is that it would be hard
hard to start and to finish
we @entity6 can be a bit lazy when it comes to messy civic and historical truths
we want our stories -- and our story -- to have happy endings
we want reconciliation on the cheap
but the point of @entity5 , and of @entity210 's entire life , is that true redemption is never cheap or easy
so to honor him truly , let 's commit to what 's hard
whether through official commissions or citizen conversations , let 's face ourselves .
