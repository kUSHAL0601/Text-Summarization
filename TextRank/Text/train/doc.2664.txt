government spokesman @entity14 said the council asked that international relief agencies , including the @entity17 , provide aid to the @entity19 and the @entity21 ethnic groups and to people in other affected areas in the state
@entity25 said the council had resolved to deploy more forces to guarantee security

@entity2 gains control of town the council of ministers directed the two ethnic groups to return women and children from both sides who have been abducted and to reunite them with their communities , @entity25 said
the council said the national forces were in full control of @entity44 , in @entity7
the @entity17 sent a battalion of peacekeepers to @entity44 last week amid reports that members of the @entity19 tribe were marching toward the town , which is home to the @entity21 tribe , after attacking the village of @entity53
in a statement posted thursday by the independent @entity55 of @entity2 , @entity25 was quoted as saying the @entity19 should vacate @entity21 territory so that the government can deliver relief services there
he appealed to the commissioners of @entity61 and @entity44 counties to cooperate with the government to ensure the return of the abducted children and property of @entity19 and @entity21 communities
the @entity67 - based @entity66 , a nongovernmental organization , condemned the attacks between the @entity19 and the @entity21 and called on the government to protect citizens from all ethnic groups
" competition between ethnic groups over scarce resources has escalated in @entity2 , " said @entity71 , @entity72 's head of conflict prevention , in a statement posted on the group 's website
" at the same time there is a security vacuum , leading to the formation of militia groups and a breakdown of traditional structures of authority
this will continue to threaten the stability of the new nation , unless the government acts quickly to ensure security , inclusive representation for all communities , and equitable access to land and natural resources
" ethnic tensions in the @entity2 state of @entity7 have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights , disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children
fighters first struck @entity44 on saturday , attacking a portion that was out of the reach of @entity17 peacekeepers , said col. @entity111 of the @entity2 army

" the attack on @entity44 followed reports last week that @entity19 fighters raided @entity53 , burning it to the ground and forcing thousands to flee toward @entity44
at least 50,000 people have fled the violence in the state , said @entity128 , chief of radio at @entity130 , a @entity17 - backed radio station in @entity2
@entity17 secretary - general @entity132 last week urged the groups to work with the government of @entity2 to find solutions
the violence in @entity7 state is the latest to rock @entity2 , which officially gained its statehood in july after separating from the north
@entity2 celebrate birth of their nation " the attacks , which on the face of it appear to be cattle raids , have deeper underlying causes related to poverty , competition for scarce resources , the ubiquity of small arms left over from a decades - long war and marginalization of ethnic minorities , " said @entity72 's @entity71
" in addition , the conflict between the @entity19 and @entity21 is taking on a dynamic of repeated revenge attacks , highlighting the need for the government to take urgent action to protect innocent civilians
" according to @entity72 's 2011 research , some groups feel that they are not represented by the political system , and that resources have been diverted to more populous ethnic groups , leaving them poorer with unreliable access to land and resources .
