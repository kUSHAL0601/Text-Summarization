@entity0 -- the @entity4 press should be regulated by an independent group supported by law and with the power to fine , a judge recommended thursday in a long - awaited report sparked by a phone - hacking scandal at @entity10 's @entity12 tabloid
judge @entity13 said he was not recommending that @entity14 set up a press regulator , but that the industry should create its own , which would be backed by legislation to make sure it meets certain standards of independence and effectiveness
prime minister @entity21 , who asked the judge to prepare the report , told @entity14 after its release that he agrees with @entity13 's recommendations for a new , strong , independent press regulator
he said the onus is now on the press to implement the report 's recommendations , " and implement them radically
" @entity1 : @entity4 press react to hacking report but @entity21 said he is not convinced that legislation is needed to underpin the new body -- and he has serious concerns about taking that approach
at the same time , the prime minister said that the " status quo is not an option " and that the victims of press abuses have " suffered in a way that we can barely begin to imagine
" @entity44 , a subsidiary of the @entity10 - owned @entity45 , backed @entity21 's call for regulation without legislation
" we accept that a new system should be independent , have a standards code , a means of resolving disputes , the power to demand prominent apologies and the ability to levy heavy fines , " the company said in a statement
signaling a difference of views within the coalition government , deputy prime minister @entity58 , who leads the @entity59 , said he believes new legislation is needed to ensure the regulator 's long - term independence
@entity66 , leader of the opposition @entity67 , also said he favors full implementation of @entity13 's recommendations , including the new legislation
cross-party talks are expected later thursday to discuss a way forward
read the report summary ( @entity74 ) in his report , @entity13 said that he had no desire to jeopardize the freedom of the press , which he acknowledged plays a " vital " role in safeguarding the public interest , but that changes are needed to tackle abuses
the @entity4 press has ignored its own code of conduct on " far too many occasions over the last decade , " causing " real hardship " and sometimes wreaking " havoc with the lives of innocent people , " @entity13 said
" this is not just the famous but ordinary members of the public , caught up in events ( many of them , truly tragic ) far larger than they could cope with but made much , much worse by press behavior that , at times , can only be described as outrageous , " he said
at the same time , no one proposed that the government or @entity14 should be involved in regulating the press , @entity13 said
the judge recommends that the new body have new powers to impose tough sanctions against newspapers that break the rules , including the imposition of fines of up to 1 % of turnover , to a maximum of 1 million pounds ( $ 1.6 million )
opinion : why the @entity4 should avoid muzzling its free press the judge said the relationship between the press and politicians is mostly " robust , " but sometimes the links can be " too close
" he highlighted as a concern " relationships between policy makers and those in the media who stand to gain or lose from the policy being considered
" this risks undermining public confidence in the press and politicians , he said
@entity21 said he accepted that more transparency was needed over such links
but the prime minister pointed out that @entity13 had " emphatically " rejected allegations that the @entity128 had struck some kind of deal with @entity44
this related to claims that its newspapers might have offered favorable coverage to @entity21 in the expectation of " policy favors
" @entity21 's government faced uncomfortable questions earlier this year over its handling of a bid by @entity10 's @entity45 to take over @entity4 satellite broadcaster @entity142
the bid was eventually dropped
opinion : why @entity4 's shamed newspapers need regulating the prime minister also backed @entity13 's recommendations to break an " excessively cozy relationship " between the police and the press
@entity13 said there was a perception that some senior police officers within @entity0 's @entity154 were too close to @entity44
but he found no evidence that decisions to limit its earlier inquiries into phone hacking were due to undue influence or corruption
@entity13 said senior police officers should ensure greater transparency over their meetings with the press in the future , and they should not be able to move immediately from the police into jobs in the media
the @entity154 said that the integrity of its officers had not been questioned but that it would study the criticisms made in the report
commissioner @entity173 said he had already taken " decisive action " to address issues that emerged during the inquiry
" our priority now is the victims of phone hacking and making sure they get justice , " he said
opinion : press dishes it out , but can it take it ? @entity13 described his inquiry , which heard from hundreds of witnesses during eight months of hearings , as " the most concentrated look at the press this country has ever seen
" those testifying included politicians including @entity21 and former prime ministers @entity195 and @entity197 ; police and media players such as @entity10 ; and victims of press abuses
the inquiry was first announced by @entity21 in july 2011 in response to public outrage over a newspaper phone - hacking scandal
the trigger was the allegation that in 2002 , the voice mail of a missing 13 - year - old girl , @entity210 , had been hacked by an investigator working for the @entity12 newspaper before she was found murdered
compounding the anger was the claim ( later dismissed by police ) that messages were deleted by him from the schoolgirl 's full voice mail box , giving her parents false hope that she was alive
the furor forced the closure of the 168 - year - old @entity12 , owned by @entity44
it also prompted a new appetite among @entity4 's public and political establishments to see the sleazy underbelly of ( often tabloid ) reporting exposed and steps taken to clean up the media 's act
@entity13 's report was the subject of much speculation before its release
freedom of expression groups warned of a potential impacts on freedom of speech , while campaigners for greater controls said regulation is essential
the chairman of the @entity242 , @entity243 , said he did not agree with all @entity13 's recommendations but all those involved must seek to unite around " common ground
" " we all agree that we must regain the trust and confidence of the @entity4 people to make sure that unacceptable , outrageous and illegal behavior can never be allowed to happen again , " @entity243 said in a written statement
the @entity252 issued a release saying it is " deeply concerned " about the recommendations
" a media regulatory body anchored by statute can not be described as voluntary , " the committee 's executive director , @entity257 , said in the release
" moreover , adopting statutory regulation would undermine press freedom in the @entity4 and give legitimacy to governments around the world that routinely silence journalists through such controls
" @entity268 , a free speech group , urged " serious , considered debate " about the points made by @entity13
chief executive @entity272 said : " we share @entity21 's concerns that statutory underpinning would undermine free speech , and could be the start of a slippery slope of government interference in the media
" media reform campaign group hacked @entity283 launched an online petition that calls on the leaders of the three main parties to implement the @entity288 's recommendations in full " as soon as possible
" timeline of the @entity4 phone hacking scandal the actions of staffers at @entity45 and @entity44 came under close scrutiny during the inquiry
among those to testify were @entity10 protege @entity296 , former chief executive of @entity44 and onetime editor of the @entity299 and @entity12 , and @entity300 , who also edited the @entity12
he went on to become @entity21 's director of communications before resigning from that post early last year
both appeared in court thursday morning to face charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office in connection with alleged illegal payments to public officials
they and three other accused were released on bail and ordered to appear in court again next week
the scandal has also raised the specter of possible legal action against @entity45 staffers in the @entity318 under the @entity319 , which outlaws the bribery of foreign officials by @entity318 firms
however , analyst @entity323 in @entity324 said the release of the @entity13 report is " a nonevent " from the point of view of @entity318 investors and would have no real impact on @entity45 stocks
the corporation is doing well and @entity10 has come back " stronger than ever " following the pressure he was under to cede control of parts of his media empire early this year , @entity323 said
@entity1 's @entity338 and @entity339 contributed to this report .
