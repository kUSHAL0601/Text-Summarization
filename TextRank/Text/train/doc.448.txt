the @entity0 has expressed " deep concern " about mob violence reportedly targeting international ngos operating in @entity5 's restive west
in a statement released thursday , the @entity0 @entity6 highlighted what it viewed as " the continued lack of adequate security forces and rule of law on the ground in @entity13 , " the capital of @entity15
@entity15 , located along @entity5 's west coast , has been at the center of an ongoing sectarian conflict between @entity19 and @entity21 muslims , which has seen hundreds of people killed and tens of thousands more made homeless
@entity24 controversy an upcoming census planned by the central government has triggered further unrest amid fears it could exacerbate tensions between the state 's majority @entity32 population and the @entity21 -- a stateless @entity36 minority not recognized as citizens or one of the country 's 135 " official " ethnic groups
@entity5 's government has come under increased pressure to take action to ease the unrest , and recently sent more troops to the region
the attacks this week in @entity13 , which targeted the offices and facilities of a number of international aid agencies working in the city , were triggered by reports that a foreign aid worker had treated a @entity32 flag disrespectfully
the worker in question , a staffer with the @entity58 - based humanitarian group @entity57 , had removed the flag from its building
many flags have been hung on buildings across the state ahead of the census as a sign of opposition to the @entity21 population -- who are widely viewed as intruders from across the border in @entity70
in a statement posted on their website friday , @entity71 , secretary general of @entity57 , wrote : " @entity57 is committed to the humanitarian principles and therefore the absolute ethnic and political neutrality of our work is our highest priority
we therefore avoid any form of political , religious or ethnic partisanship
that is the reason why our program coordinator has removed the @entity32 flag which -- in the local context -- might be seen as a symbol for a political positioning
she did not act in any degrading manner or express any cultural misconduct
" aid groups ' bias ' but foreign aid groups have come under fire in @entity5 for allegedly showing bias towards the @entity21
last month , @entity95 ( @entity95 ) was banned from operating in the volatile state following protests by ethnic @entity99 nationalists against the organization and other international ngos
@entity5 's government said the organization had been banned for consistently showing bias towards the state 's @entity36 minority and breaching the terms of its agreement to operate in @entity99 , where it provided services to tens of thousands of patients
@entity95 said it was " deeply shocked by this unilateral decision
" as the major ngo healthcare provider in @entity99 , it ran clinics in nine townships across the state , " treating anyone who was unable to access the medical care they required , " including tens of thousands of vulnerable people who had been displaced into camps by recurrent communal violence .
