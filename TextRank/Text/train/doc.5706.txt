-- on tuesday , a federal advisory panel , the @entity1 , recommended that university scientists who have submitted articles on how to modify a flu virus to two very prestigious journals delete critical information from them before publishing
the papers describe how to alter bird - flu virus to be more infectious and potentially nastier
yes , this is same bird flu virus that , as it moved into pigs , was freaking us all out last year
if you had the detailed map of the viral changes needed , then either a terrorist or an amateur " garage " biologist operating without the right safeguards would have a very effective critter for killing you and me
if there is one thing that scientists hate , it is any policy that restricts research in any way
scientists are taught that they need to be bold in asking questions and not let anything deter them from following their thinking wherever it leads , no matter how unpopular that might be
they are also taught the absolute necessity of making their claims public in reputable journals so that other scientists can subject them to the critical skepticism from which the truth ultimately emerges
once in a long while , however , the price of the truth is simply too high to let scientists disclose their findings publicly
that is so when it comes to publishing detailed information about dangerous viruses and microbes
we do n't have to hide the genetic map for a killer avian flu virus from all eyes
access to some who have clearance to see it should be possible
if that is done , then the truth will still be known about whether those making claims of being able to engineer the virus can actually do so
to go further with potentially catastrophic data is to court trouble
there are those who will say that the only way to fight terror is to adhere to those values that have proven crucial to the advance of science over the decades
the more we know , the worse for the terrorists
unfortunately , that is no longer the world we live in
the ethics of inquiry need to adapt
handing the complete formula for making a nasty pandemic bug to any nut with access to the @entity80 or a subscription to a scientific journal makes no sense in a world that has seen the use of anthrax and sarin as weapons of terror
freedom is key to good science
freedom from terror is also key to good science
when they conflict , the latter is more important freedom than the former
journals and those who write for them ought to do all they can to try and ensure that most important freedom
