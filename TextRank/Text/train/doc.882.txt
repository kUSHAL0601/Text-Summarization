-- on the @entity2 , a truly private conversation is hard to come by
personal communications on apps , e-mail and social networks are very much an open book , and they leave a trail of personal data that can potentially be accessed by criminals , corporations and government agencies
no wonder more and more people are using apps whose messages quickly disappear from phones once they 've been read
take @entity17 , a self - destructing messaging app that takes security very seriously
the free app has been available on @entity22 for a little more than a year and on monday , it expanded its reach to a wider audience with an @entity26 version
like the better - known @entity28 ( and the lesser - known @entity29 ) , messages on @entity17 live briefly before supposedly vanishing forever from your phone and the prying eyes of computer servers
there are many security advantages to this type of communication
the format makes it difficult for recipients to share , forward and spread messages
any sensitive photos or texts have a better chance of not becoming a permanent artifact on the @entity2
they are also deleted from the companies ' servers ( or in the case of @entity17 , never stored on a company server ) , making it difficult for hackers , criminals or government agencies to retrieve old conversations
@entity28 has become hugely popular in the past year
its users now send more than 350 million photos a day
the company has played down the security advantages of self - destructing messages , focusing instead on the playful aspects of the " ephemeral " messaging trend , like having fun and living in the moment
fairly or not , the service has also developed a reputation as a platform for sexting
" @entity28 is not a great way to send photos you want to keep safe and secure , " said @entity28 co-founder @entity70 at the @entity72 conference last week
he cited the ability of recipients to take screenshots and of hackers to access content as reasons the platform was n't safe for " inappropriate photos
" @entity17 was developed by computer - security experts and has some heavy - duty layers of security to keep communications anonymous and private
each message -- whether text , photo , video or voice -- is encrypted with a one - time - use unique key , and only the sender and @entity17 users have those keys
any telling metadata is stripped out when you send attachments , and deleted messages are forensically erased , or " shredded , " from your device
" no security is 100 % , but we are the best available , " said @entity102 , ceo and co-founder of @entity17
@entity17 also has a few more messaging features than the minimalist @entity28
you can choose to let messages live for days , not just seconds
the @entity22 app can send encrypted attachments , though you can not yet send @entity113 attachments on the @entity26 version
@entity17 's founders frequently test the app with their own network of well - known hackers , and as well as with a tougher crowd : kids
" we really made it to try and protect them from the permanence of the @entity2 , " said @entity102 , whose own children use the app. there are always security risks
if your phone is compromised , a hacker could track keystrokes while you are typing out messages
people are another potential weak link -- someone could steal your phone while you are logged in
or the person on the receiving end of your messages could violate your trust and share the information
" you have to remember , there 's no magic pill for betrayers , " said @entity102
unlike @entity28 , @entity17 does n't give a notification when someone captures a screenshot
it 's difficult to take one , and the company thought a notification would give users a false sense of security
@entity17 does n't just want to take on @entity28 , it also hopes to be an alternative to @entity156 , @entity157 and free international texting tools like @entity159
typical online - communication tools store information on servers indefinitely
that can include the content of messages , participants in the conversation , time stamps and even location information
many of the companies that host the messages , like @entity172 and @entity173 , make their money on personal data which they use to sell targeted ads. they are n't invested in keeping your personal data private because it 's not smart business
@entity17 has a different type of business plan that is n't based on personal data
the app is free , but eventually the company will charge its power users for in - app purchases , such as paying for a message to live forever
in a year filled with increased awareness of cybersecurity and the government 's ability to snoop on digital communications , @entity17 's anonymous , highly secure communication may be a killer feature all on its own .
