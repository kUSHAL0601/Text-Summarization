@entity0 -- protesters enraged by a @entity4 vote to triple university tuition rate caps , attacked a car carrying prince @entity7 and @entity8 , thursday night
the demonstrators broke a window and tossed paint on the car , however neither royal family member was injured in the attack
' we can confirm that their @entity17 ' car was attacked by protesters on the way to their engagement at the @entity21 this evening , " a spokesman for the prince said
" a wire photo of the royal couple , dressed in evening wear , shows startled expressions on their faces as they sit in their @entity28 before exiting for a @entity29
the high - profile incident came late in day of violent protests that left at least 12 officers and 43 demonstrators hurt
the attack followed a vote in the @entity36 to approve a plan to raise the existing cap on tuition rates charged by universities from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000
in @entity42 dollars , that 's a nearly $ 10,000 increase -- from roughly $ 4,700 to $ 14,000
lawmakers approved the plan in a 323 - 302 vote
the measure awaits approval by the @entity47 and a signature by the queen before it can become law
the vote ended hours of debate inside @entity4 and an all - day protest by thousands of demonstrators outside who said the plan will price many students out of a university education
supporters say the tuition cap hike is needed to cut the government 's massive deficit
@entity62 was relatively quiet late thursday as mounted police pushed back the last knot of protesters
" extreme violence currently being directed towards officers is hindering attempts to allow nonviolent protesters to leave the containment area , " police said
prime minister @entity72 said the level of violence was unacceptable
in recent weeks , the proposal has spawned multiple public protests , set off tremors within the nation 's coalition government and prompted a back - seat revolt among some @entity81 in @entity4
@entity81 are lesser partners in a coalition government ruled by conservatives
the @entity0 protest started out peacefully thursday , but grew more tense with the winding down of debate in the @entity36
by late afternoon , police on horseback attempted to push back throngs of protesters moving on @entity4
students reacted by throwing sticks and setting off fireworks
after the vote , riot police were called out to quell disturbances in @entity96 , including the setting afire of a christmas tree
before the fire was set , a demonstrator was seen climbing the tree
one officer was hospitalized after falling from his horse and another suffered a serious neck injury after being knocked unconscious , the @entity102 said
four other officers required unspecified hospital treatment
the police service announced the arrest of 26 protesters on charges ranging from arson and assaulting a police officer to drunk and disorderly conduct
@entity0 's @entity102 condemned many of the protesters
" this has nothing to do with peaceful protest
students are involved in wanton vandalism , including smashing windows in @entity124 and @entity125 , " the department said late thursday on its website
" innocent @entity127 shoppers are being caught up in the violence and disruption
protest organizers had urged demonstrators to show restraint
earlier this month , police arrested a total of 153 people following another protest at @entity96 during which students damaged a police van , set small fires and spray painted and smashed government building windows
one final - year student , standing in front of police lines outside @entity144 on thursday , told @entity1 he was there out of solidarity with students who may be priced out of a place at university
" we 're all here because we 're passionate about this
we feel betrayed , " he said
prior to vote , another protester screamed , " @entity156 ... you 're a sellout ! you have betrayed us ! " the protester was referring to the @entity160 deputy prime minister and @entity162 architect of the coalition government
the government is headed by prime minister @entity72 , a conservative
@entity156 supports the tuition increase plan
at least a dozen other party members , including deputy party leader @entity168 , said they oppose it
supporters say the tuition cap hike is needed to help pay down the government 's massive debt
they argue the increase is not mandatory , that universities would not be bound to charge university students the full £ 9,000
under the new plan , students would n't have to start paying off their school loans until they begin earning at least £ 21,000 , about $ 32,600 , a year
students currently must start paying off their loans once they reach a £ 15,000 ( roughly $ 23,300 ) threshold
