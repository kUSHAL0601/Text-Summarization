-- as @entity2 struggles to come to terms with its greatest loss of life in decades , all eyes are on the man charged in the explosion in central @entity9 and the deadly shooting rampage at a youth camp
while police have not officially named him , @entity2 television and newspaper reports have identified the suspect as 32 - year - old @entity18
a rambling 1,518 - page manifesto purportedly written by someone using that name offered a rationale and action plan for terror attacks like those inflicted on @entity2 last week
there are clear pictures of what @entity18 looks like , at least , via images showing him with blond hair , blue - green eyes and chiseled features
in some cases , he 's wearing seemingly preppy clothes , though in others he strikes a far more militaristic stance
and the suspect will " explain himself " in court on monday , attorney @entity39 -- who claimed to represent @entity18 -- told @entity2 's @entity40 late saturday
yet even with these photos , even with the voluminous text in his manifesto , even if he does detail his reasoning monday , troubling questions are likely to remain
chief among them is how and why a native @entity2 turned on his countrymen
what is known is that @entity18 is a member of the @entity54 and has three weapons registered in his name , according to leading @entity2 newspaper @entity57 , which cited @entity2 's official weapons register
they are a glock pistol , a rifle and a shotgun , @entity57 reported
@entity18 is registered as having run a company that produced " vegetables , melons , roots and tubers " -- an industry which allows access to large amounts of fertilizer that can be used for explosives -- according to state - run broadcaster @entity64
an employee at a @entity2 agricultural cooperative told @entity0 that the man identified in media reports as the suspect in last friday 's attacks bought six tons of fertilizer from her company in may
@entity82 , of @entity83 , said she did not think the order was strange at the time because the suspect has a farm , but after the @entity9 attack she called police because she knew the material can be used to make bombs
@entity64 also reported that @entity18 does not have a military background and , in fact , was exempt from @entity2 's mandatory military service
he has not had any special military training , it adds on its website
he was a youth and adult member of the conservative @entity98 ( @entity98 ) or @entity98 , @entity57 newspaper reports , remaining involved until 2007
the party 's most prominent manifesto pledge is to minimize immigration
his membership was confirmed by a senior party member , @entity104 , who is quoted by @entity57 as saying that encountering @entity18 was " like meeting @entity105 before @entity106 " in the manifesto , which police said was posted online the day of the attacks , a writer claiming to be @entity18 writes positively of the @entity98 , calling it " the only major political party in @entity2 that has voiced any serious opposition to the madness of @entity116 immigration
" but he only , effusively claims membership as a " @entity118 " in what he calls the pan-european " conservative revolutionary movements in @entity121
" the philosophy presented in the document -- which also serves as part diatribe , part confessional and part action plan -- targets so - called " cultural @entity129 / multicultural ideals
" the writer makes clear that he not only opposes multiculturalism in @entity121 , including any increase in the number of in immigrants or @entity116 , but that he has thought out how to use violence to combat it
the manifesto and a related video are titled " 2083 : a @entity140 @entity145 , " a date that the author later explains is the year he believes a @entity140 civil war will end with the execution of what he calls " cultural marxists
" this " civil war " would come in three phases , he predicts
the first runs through 2030 and includes " open source warfare , military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems ( and ) further consolidation of conservative forces
" between 2030 and 2070 , he calls for " more advanced forms of resistance groups ( and the ) preparation of pan-european coup d'etats
" the final stage features the deposition of @entity121 's leadership and " implementation of a cultural conservative political agenda
" a vitriolic hatred of outside forces , and desire to oust them from @entity121 , pervades the document
but it especially targets @entity116 , culminating in 2083 with their deportation from the continent
such animosity is consistent with a post in @entity18 's name on an online forum , @entity176 , from december 2009 , talks about @entity178 teenagers being " in an especially precarious situation with regards to being harassed by @entity182 youth
" " i know of many hundred occasions where non-muslims have been robbed , beaten up and harassed by @entity182 gangs , " the post reads
" i had a best friend between the ages of 12 - 17 who was a @entity191 , so i was one of the many protected , cool ' potatoes ' that had protection
but this also made me see the hypocrisy up close and personal and made me nauseous
" such @entity197 sentiment is nothing new in @entity2 or other @entity140 nations , where there has been resistance against increasing numbers of @entity116 and their practices
about 3 % of @entity2 's population in 2010 -- 144,000 people -- were @entity116 , but that was expected to more than double to 6.5 % over the next 20 years , according to a report released earlier this year by @entity209
that is one of the largest percentage increases in @entity116 populations across all of @entity121 , thanks in part to fertility rates significantly higher than those of non-muslims
another post in @entity18 's name in october 2009 advises " @entity222 " , described as the founder of @entity176 , to " develop an alternative to the violent extreme @entity2 @entity129 organisations @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 " -- all left - wing movements in @entity2
" the conservatives dare not openly express their viewpoints in public because they know that the extreme @entity233 will trump them
we can not accept the fact that the @entity236 is subsidising these violent " @entity237 , who are systematically terrorising the politically conservative , " the post reads
he is making a reference to the youth movement of prime minister @entity242 , who heads the @entity236
the manifesto 's author does not telegraph his plan for july 22 , even as he extensively delves into bomb - making techniques , evading authorities and his long - range military ambitions
but he is sharply critical of leadership of @entity2 , with last week 's attacks targeting government buildings and a youth camp run by the ruling @entity236 , blaming them for embracing ideals that allowed the " @entity254 of @entity121
" the writer states he was moved to action in 1999 by " my government 's involvement " in @entity260 's strikes during the @entity262 campaign , claiming this campaign wrongly targeted " our @entity265 brothers ( who ) wanted to drive @entity182 out by deporting the @entity266 @entity116 back to @entity266
" he also criticizes " my government 's cowardly handling of the @entity270 cartoon issue " -- a reference to the @entity2 government 's apology for the nation 's private newspapers having repeatedly published the controversial cartoon
another reference blasts @entity2 , home of the @entity279 awards , for awarding a peace prize to late @entity282 leader @entity281
speaking in both specific and general terms , the manifesto 's author does n't hide his militant expertise or aims
but it is only near the end of the document that he appears willing to take matters into his own hands , citing " the old saying , ' if you want something done , then do it yourself
' " acting national police chief @entity295 told reporters sunday said that the suspect , arrested on @entity298 after gunning down at least 86 people there after killing at least seven in the @entity9 bombing , insisted he acted alone
police still say , though , that they have n't ruled out others may not have been involved , and the manifesto does allude to like - minded right - wing revolutionaries
that said , the document 's author does predict " all my friends and family ( will ) detest me and call me a monster , " and that media will " have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate , vilify and demonize
" but ultimately , he writes that he believes he and other revolutionaries will be remembered fondly , part of his rallying cry for " the emerging @entity140 conservative resistance movement
" " your name will be remembered for centuries , " the document states
" you will forever be celebrated by your people as a martyr for your country , protecting your culture and fighting for your kin and for @entity332
" @entity0 's @entity333 and @entity334 contributed to this report .
