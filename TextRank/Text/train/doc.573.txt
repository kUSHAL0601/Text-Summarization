-- @entity2 's @entity1 scored twice including an injury - time winner as they beat @entity4 2 - 1 on saturday to cut @entity6 's lead at the top of the @entity8 to two points
it was a scarcely convincing performance from @entity2 at @entity11 and the visitors looked to be heading to a deserved point until the @entity15 international burst into their penalty area to beat @entity17 with a convincing finish
@entity1 had put @entity2 ahead in first half injury time only for @entity20 to equalize for @entity4 just after the hour mark with a neat turn and shot
the result leaves @entity2 with 23 points from 11 games , with leaders @entity6 on 25 from 10
the reigning champions can re-open a five - point gap with victory over @entity31 at @entity32 on sunday
third - placed @entity33 will join @entity2 on 23 points if they beat promoted @entity35 in another sunday fixture at the @entity37
a sour note for @entity2 was the truncated return of @entity41 international midfielder @entity40 , the long - term injury absentee lasting just a few minutes in his first start for two years before he limped off with a hamstring strain
" it was a long struggle , " manager @entity45 told mutv
" given the changes i had to make , trying to get the continuity of performance was difficult
" some players played with touches of flu and others with diarrhoea , so we 've done really well to get a result
" earlier , @entity59 suffered an hangover from their midweek @entity62 triumph over @entity63 as they went down 4 - 2 at @entity64 in the lunchtime kick off
two goals from @entity67 , who would have impressed watching @entity41 manager @entity69 , including a second half penalty , put them 3 - 0 up at the @entity72 with @entity73 crashing home the second
it was the cue for a belated @entity59 comeback as an @entity79 curler and superb volley from @entity81 cut the deficit to a single goal , only for @entity84 to kill the game off in injury time
they move above @entity59 on goal difference into fifth place , with @entity90 , who beat @entity92 2 - 0 , also on 15 points
meanwhile @entity95 's @entity94 headed a 94th - minute equalizer to salvage a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity99 , who are still searching for their first @entity8 win since september
@entity102 had put @entity99 ahead just before halftime
in the @entity105 , @entity104 have gone to the top with an amazing 9 - 0 thrashing of @entity108 at @entity109
@entity110 and @entity111 both scored hat - tricks in the rout which sees @entity104 move two points clear of @entity115 in the title race .
