-- when @entity4 hit the eastern @entity5 and the country 's largest city , millions of residents across our five boroughs felt its impact and devastation
many of us felt vulnerable , unsure what the next days would bring
communities are still reeling from the aftermath and the most difficult period may still be ahead
but as our city begins to rebuild and recover , @entity15 and others in the region who already struggle on a regular basis will have the hardest time getting back on their feet
thankfully , we 've seen a huge outpouring of support and number of people willing to donate their time and resources to help
and for those willing to pitch in , please join us
our government is certainly doing its best to help those in need in the aftermath of the storm , but the nonprofit sector plays such a critical role in the delivery of health and human services across @entity15 and throughout the country
numerous low - income families depend on vital community - based nonprofits to access the services they need for daily living
that is one reason why @entity48 created the @entity49 ( # sandyfund )
local @entity50 along the @entity51 will use contributions to the fund to address the near - and long - term recovery needs of communities most affected by the hurricane
in addition , the fund will bolster @entity48 community impact partners that serve hurricane - affected individuals and families who are already vulnerable -- struggling with food insecurity and the ability meet their most basic needs
disasters like this unprecedented storm undoubtedly impact all of our communities
our most under - resourced communities , however , have been trying to make ends meet even before @entity4 barreled in
for the third straight year , @entity15 's poverty rate has been on the rise according to census bureau data , with one in five @entity15 lacking enough income and earnings to pay for basic necessities
in fact , @entity48 of @entity15 's most recent hunger survey found that two - thirds of @entity15 were concerned that someone they know will need help getting and paying for food in the next 12 months
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity51 these financial pressures are exacerbated when an unexpected hardship like a natural disaster strikes
some families ' primary earners continue to lose hourly wages because they ca n't get to work
in other cases , those jobs no longer exist as flooded offices and businesses have been forced to close
the loss of even a week 's income can be devastating , never mind being suddenly thrust into unemployment
plus , tens of thousands of @entity15 will be displaced for weeks to come
some may be unable to return to their homes at all
it is not the first time @entity48 has stepped in to help those most in need
for example , following the 9/11 attacks , @entity48 of @entity15 created the september 11th fund in partnership with the @entity110 , raising and distributing more than $ 500 million
following the devastating earthquake in @entity112 in 2010 , @entity48 of @entity15 partnered with the @entity113 to found and fund the @entity114 to address the short - and long - term needs of affected individuals residing in @entity15
and following last year 's @entity118 , @entity48 of @entity117 set up the @entity119 to help those in need
our needs today remain just as great
early estimates put @entity4 's damage at $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion in losses
let 's not forget about our already struggling low - income families who will feel these losses deeply .
