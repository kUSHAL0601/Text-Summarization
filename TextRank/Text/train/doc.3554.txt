-- the last remaining places for @entity4 football 's showpiece tournament will be decided on tuesday when eight nations compete in the second leg of the @entity8 playoffs
ten countries have already qualified , along with co-hosts @entity10 and @entity12 , for the four - yearly tournament taking place in june and july
the most evenly - poised tie is in @entity16 , where 2004 hosts @entity17 take on @entity18 following friday 's 0 - 0 draw in @entity20
@entity21 reached the semifinals in 2008 , but face an uphill struggle to appear at the 14th staging of the event after @entity26 won 3 - 0 in the first leg in @entity28
@entity31 , competing for the first time as an independent nation , will also have to overhaul a deficit at home after losing 2 - 0 in @entity34 to the @entity35 -- who finished runners - up on debut in 1996 after the split with @entity40
@entity41 caused a surprise by reaching the playoffs after taking second place in @entity45 behind @entity46 , meaning 2010 @entity49 qualifiers @entity47 and @entity50 missed out
however , the @entity51 @entity4 are unlikely to be included in the december 2 group - stage draw after losing 4 - 0 in @entity53 to the @entity54 on friday
the @entity55 have qualified for the finals only once , in 1988
next year will be the last time the tournament is played by 16 teams ahead of an expansion to 24
world champions @entity60 will defend their @entity4 title , having qualified as group winners along with @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , the @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71
@entity72 went through as the second - placed team with the best record .
