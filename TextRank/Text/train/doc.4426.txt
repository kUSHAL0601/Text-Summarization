-- with @entity2 's announcement wednesday that it will become a publicly traded company , lots of folks were talking about it
the company filed wednesday to raise $ 5 billion in an initial public offering
most analysts predict that @entity2 's valuation will ultimately fall somewhere between $ 85 billion and $ 100 billion
those staggering numbers had @entity2 users -- those whose privacy settings defaulted to public -- largely pondering one major school of thought : " wow , that 's a lot of money
" " $ 5 billion ipo for @entity2 ? ! ? ! ? what the hell am i doing on @entity2 ? ? ? " wrote a user named @entity20
" screw this ... i 'm making @entity23
i should have something whipped up in an hour
friend me , follow me ... whatever ...
it 's time to get paid
" @entity2 user @entity26 pondered what the big - dollar opening says about careers in the tech industry
" hmm to become a hardware engineer or software engineer ? " he wrote
" @entity2 's ipo expected to create between 500 and 1,000 millionaires among employees
soo the answer is : software engineer
" @entity38 had more humble ambitions
" anybody want to split a share 10 ways ? " he joked
other users predicted a flood of would - be investors
" i expect people will be crawling over each other to invest after the @entity49 , " wrote @entity46
" it will be interesting to see whether @entity2 can match the expectations that will come along with its new , and likely obscenely high , valuation
" mostly , however , the big financial news inspired a lot of wry observations
" ironically @entity2 could be dealing [ with ] the same problem with public scrutiny after the ipo as most of us do when deciding what to post on @entity2 , " wrote user @entity56
user @entity61 lobbed this one : " with facebook becoming a public traded company and making everyone go to the stupid timelines , what are the odds of it going the way of myspace ? " well ... at its peak , @entity73 paid ( some would say overpaid ) $ 580 million for @entity76
that 's hundreds of millions less than what @entity2 earned just last year
and we do n't see @entity2 being sold for a paltry $ 35 million -- as @entity76 was last year -- anytime soon
@entity2 earned $ 1 billion last year on sales of $ 3.7 billion
the site said it now has more than 845 million daily active users
and that 's the number that had user @entity84 thinking that maybe @entity2 should spread the wealth a little
he even encouraged users to take their case to ceo @entity88
@entity2 is about to ipo in a moment
am i the only person that thinks every @entity2 member should receive at least 1 share at initial post ? if it was n't for all of you loyal and faithful @entity98 , this would never have gotten this far
so , everyone , message the high " z " for your minimum 1 share
lol ! " hey ... ca n't blame him for trying
