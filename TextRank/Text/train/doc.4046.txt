@entity1 , @entity0 -- these are tense times for the @entity4
going sponsorless : the 2008/2009 football season has seen numerous issues with shirt sponsors
the cause of the tension is n't the battle between the leading title contenders on the pitch ; instead it 's the waiting to see what impact the international financial crisis will have off the field
outside of television rights packages , one of the major strands of income for football clubs is various sponsorship deals ; and as big companies hit by the financial crisis have either folded or slashed spending budgets -- these agreements have come under serious threat
tell us whether you think football 's massive salaries will survive the financial crisis in the @entity33 box below
@entity34 , the bank which has been the naming sponsor of the @entity4 since 2001 , is currently reviewing its sponsorship deals -- a process which includes considering its £ 66 million ( $ 100m ) three - year deal in @entity0
and like many other banks , financial institutions and major businesses , @entity34 has been hit hard by the recent economic climate , so a new deal is certainly not a done deal
but it 's not just the @entity0 game that faces sponsorship uncertainty
last month @entity48 president @entity47 acknowledged that broadcasting and sponsorship revenues are decreasing across the global game , following a year tarnished by the credit crunch
in december , the third @entity53 in @entity54 was cancelled after @entity56 's @entity55 ( @entity55 ) pulled sponsorship for the event
in september , @entity4 side @entity59 lost their shirt - sponsor in a high - profile collapse which left the team wearing temporary covers on the front of their playing kits
fellow @entity4 side @entity67 does not have a shirt sponsor
several further sponsorship deals have been affected for various reasons in recent months
the nationalization of @entity74 - @entity73 bank @entity72 resulted in both @entity75 and @entity76 having the bank removed from their shirts ; @entity79 needs a new shirt sponsor after its £ 14m ( $ 21m ) per year shirt sponsor -- the troubled @entity83 financial institution @entity82 chose not to renew its contract ; @entity85 pulled out as @entity87 's shirt sponsor ; and @entity88 and @entity89 brought their decade - long £ 2m ( $ 3m ) per year deal to an end
despite these mounting examples of sponsor uncertainty , sports business experts believe the game of football will survive the international financial crisis
head of the @entity99 at @entity100 , @entity101 , told @entity2 there were reasons to be optimistic that sponsorship levels would not decline significantly
" i think sponsorship is one of the areas people will look at closely in the current environment ... but , that said , sport sponsorship is one of the areas that has grown very significantly
" yes it 's a difficult time but sports have done well in increasing their sponsors and i think they have delivered on that , " he said
@entity101 told @entity2 shirt sponsorships are not major sources of income for most football clubs , and some , like @entity125 's @entity124 , had chosen to use the shirt space to promote a charity ( @entity127 ) rather than seek sponsorship money
@entity101 said that big brands like @entity79 and @entity130 would perform better than their lesser known counterparts in coming years , but he said it was n't all bad for the smaller clubs
" it 's more a case of the richer getting richer and the poor getting richer , but not as fast
" in @entity139 , countries such as @entity138 were more heavily dependant on sponsorship money , so competitions like the @entity142 could be the hardest hit by a drop in sponsor revenue , he said
sports columnist at @entity146 , @entity147 , said it was likely revenue from advertising and corporate hospitality would also increasingly feel the impact of the financial crisis
@entity147 said corporate hospitality , which generated a large portion of match - day takings , could be one of the worst hit areas
" it does n't affect them ( football clubs ) in a catastrophic way , but all of it put together can have quite an impact
" @entity147 believed teams at the bottom reaches of @entity0 's @entity4 and below would be the worst hit clubs , and agreed with @entity101 that the larger clubs would survive the crisis
despite the worries , @entity101 said there was no need for global alarm
he said the football market is not immune to recession but it is " reasonably resistant "
" there are a lot worse places to be trying to run in the current economic climate than a large sports business , " he said .
