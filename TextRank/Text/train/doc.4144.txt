-- in public at least , the message was defiant
beleaguered @entity10 president @entity9 , sitting alongside @entity12 's intelligence chief , proclaimed tuesday " the determination of the people and government of @entity6 to cleanse the country of terrorists
" his @entity12 visitor , @entity21 , responded , " what is happening in @entity6 is not an internal issue but a conflict between the axis of resistance on one hand and regional and global enemies of this axis on the other
" @entity21 's comment was made public by the @entity10 news agency that @entity9 's government runs
it 's a familiar theme for the @entity12 , who have cast events in @entity6 as part of a much broader ideological battle
supreme leader ayatollah @entity30 has similarly characterized events in @entity6 as a " war between the front of hegemony and the front of resistance
" @entity36 of @entity37 believes the @entity12 must be alarmed that the tide is running fast against @entity9
" @entity12 probably has excellent information regarding @entity9 's position
that information would make clear that @entity12 is increasingly likely to lose its only ally in the region , greatly reducing its strategic reach , " he says
the last thing @entity12 wants is a @entity45 - dominated @entity6 that abandons the " axis " -- especially as the rebels ' main supporters are @entity12 's @entity50 rivals : @entity51 and @entity52
" how can those who have never held an election in their country be advocates of democracy ? " @entity21 asked in @entity57 , with a less than oblique dig at the @entity50 monarchies
@entity9 also blasted as " unacceptable " that certain foreign countries were " supporting terrorism in @entity6 " through arming the rebels
@entity12 is @entity9 's last regional ally , and @entity65 intelligence officials believe the @entity66 has provided technical help such as intelligence , communications and advice on crowd control and weapons as protest in @entity6 has morphed into resistance
a @entity76 panel reported in may that @entity12 weapons destined for @entity6 but seized in @entity78 included assault rifles , explosives , detonators , machine guns and mortar shells
@entity12 's foreign minister acknowledged wednesday that some of the 48 @entity12 kidnapped last weekend by the @entity86 near @entity57 were former military personnel
" some retired individuals from the ( @entity96 ) guards and army were dispatched to @entity6 to make a pilgrimage , " foreign minister @entity88 told the official @entity12 news agency , a statement that will likely be seized upon by the rebels as confirmation that @entity12 is directly aiding the @entity9 regime
@entity99 's inner circle : mostly family , like ' mafia ' @entity6 and @entity12 vs. @entity103 @entity6 also matters to @entity12 because it is the main conduit to the @entity106 militia @entity105 in @entity107 , the proxy through which @entity12 can threaten @entity103 with an arsenal of short - range missiles
in 2009 , the top @entity113 diplomat in @entity57 disclosed that @entity6 had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to @entity105 , according to official cables leaked to and published by @entity117
" @entity6 's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by @entity105 could prove disastrous for @entity6 and the broader region , " the diplomat wrote
the regional picture that was so favorable to @entity12 a few years ago -- as events in @entity125 moved in its favor and those in neighboring @entity128 moved against the western alliance -- is now much more challenging
international sanctions imposed chiefly by the @entity113 and @entity131 are biting , renewed political violence is destabilizing @entity125 , and @entity12 's relationship with @entity78 has eroded badly
not so long ago , @entity12 and @entity78 were on good terms
the government of @entity136 tried to be the honest broker in @entity12 's confrontation with the @entity139 over its nuclear program ; both governments worried about @entity143 separatism ; and @entity78 's guiding principle was ' zero problems with neighbors
' @entity136 said this week at a meeting of his @entity148 : " when no one else was by its side , @entity78 stood by @entity12 , despite everything
@entity78 defended its right to nuclear energy
@entity136 has been infuriated by @entity12 's attempts to paint @entity78 as conspiring with the @entity139 on @entity6
this week , @entity12 's chief of staff @entity155 accused @entity78 of helping the " belligerent objectives " of western powers , prompting the @entity157 to condemn " groundless accusations and extremely inappropriate threats " of @entity12 officials
" on @entity6 , once again i ask the @entity12 : does defending a regime that kills its brothers , and i think it has reached 25,000 by now , suit our values ? " two days in @entity167 : guns , graveyards and stairwell beds playing on differences @entity12 foreign minister @entity88 traveled to @entity78 tuesday in an effort to mend that fence
he left with what the @entity78 foreign minister called a " frank and friendly " message about intemperate language
@entity12 and @entity78 are shaping up for the next phase of the struggle for @entity6 , according to @entity181 , opinion editor at the @entity182 in @entity183
and it is likely to be a @entity6 where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures
" if the @entity192 are afraid and fall back on their heartland , there too you 're going to have a situation where a new central government in @entity57 will have to wrestle with a state that is not strongly unified , " @entity181 told the @entity189 - based @entity188
" in that context , it will create openings for the @entity12 to play on differences
" @entity78 will be working for the opposite outcome , wary that @entity6 's @entity202 might seek common cause with its own restive @entity143 minority and concerned that prolonged instability will spill into @entity107 and across @entity6 's long and porous border with @entity78
if its rhetoric is accepted at face value , @entity12 may be ready to step up support for @entity9
but does it have the resources ? as @entity36 at @entity37 notes : " sanctions are biting , oil revenues have been compressed , inflation is rampant , and reserves are limited
" but backing @entity9 , at least in the short term , may be an overriding imperative
the @entity113 says @entity12 is intensifying its support for the @entity9 regime
and most analysts expect at least more @entity12 cash and more expertise to be made available
" the diversion of perhaps tens of millions of dollars or euros in cash would certainly assist @entity9 's government as its foreign exchange reserves dwindle , " says @entity36
the provision of additional arms and intelligence is also likely in the near term , he says
less predictable , analysts say , is whether @entity105 will of its own accord or at @entity12 's behest put its considerable military expertise at @entity9 's service
@entity12 intelligence chief @entity21 met @entity105 leader @entity235 before going to @entity57
@entity235 has nailed his colors to the mast
he said last month that the four senior @entity10 officials killed in a bomb blast in @entity57 were " martyrs " and boasted that the rockets @entity105 had fired at @entity103 in 2006 were made in @entity6
@entity105 's nightmare is a hostile @entity103 on one side and a hostile @entity6 on the other , even if its internal position in @entity107 is secure
but both it and @entity12 are now trying to peer into a future as gloomy as it is opaque
@entity0 exclusive : inside @entity6
