and cultural touchstones ( " braggadocio " rhymes with " i 'll make you sick like a @entity15 " )
where they used to boast about rocking @entity21 instead of @entity22 , now @entity23 has different footwear issues : " i do n't wear @entity26 , and i do n't wear sandals / the pump do n't work ' cause the vandals took the handles
" the @entity28 : @entity1 that 's the kick of " @entity30 " -- the @entity9 sound exactly like themselves , cutting loose without straining to fit anyone else 's idea of relevance
@entity23 , @entity36 and @entity35 " @entity34 originally scheduled " @entity30 " for release in 2009 , until the project was derailed by @entity23 's battle with cancer
now cheekily retitled " @entity6 , " it 's their first album in seven years , unless you count 2007 's stoner - funk instrumental throwaway , " @entity45
" it 's also a return to classic @entity9 chutzpah : on " @entity6 , " they 're not sweating to impress anyone except one another
video : @entity1 ' @entity52 ' lead single " @entity52 " sets the tone with the group 's feistiest and funniest groove since " intergalactic " soundtracked the summer of 1998
( have you listened to " @entity58 " lately ? even nuttier than you remember
) the @entity9 ride vintage synths and cowbell , with @entity23 chanting , " we gon na party for the mother ( expletive ) right to fight ! " amid references to @entity65 and @entity66 , @entity4 drops the best line : " ca n't tell me nothing , ca n't tell me nada / do n't quote me now because i 'm doing the @entity69
" photos : @entity71 the group 's self - production has gained bounce since 2004 's to the 5 boroughs
they get guest shots from @entity78 ( " @entity80 " ) and @entity79 ( the reggae detour " @entity81 " )
the music is full of signature touches , from the punk drum solo in " @entity86 " to the low - end electro funk of " here 's a @entity89
" @entity23 sounds as gruff as ever in " @entity90 , " giving it up to hip - hop pioneers like @entity93 and @entity95 's " @entity94 , " @entity96 and @entity97 ( " @entity102 who you ca n't deny " ) , while both the bass line and the distortion - filter vocals echo @entity97 's 1980 classic " @entity101
" @entity1 were already old - school back when they were young - school , hyping an early - @entity107 hip - hop revival on " @entity108 " before the @entity107 were even over
so it 's no surprise that on " @entity6 " they make no effort to accommodate or even acknowledge any of the latest hip - hop trends
instead , we get the sound of master musicians in their comfort zone , doing everything their own way
nobody would want to hear the @entity9 try anything else
