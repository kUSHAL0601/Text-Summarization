@entity0 was " terrified of parenting " and swore it off for the first 30 years of his life
it was too much of a sacrifice : fatherhood is expensive , for starters , and he thought he just was n't cut out for it
" i was afraid to do something that would make me so vulnerable
of course the things that cause us to feel vulnerable ( and hence scared ) are the things that bring us the greatest joy and connection , " @entity0 , 33 , wrote in an e-mail
then he met a girl
and now they have an 11 - month - old boy
he was excited to discuss this " amazing transformation , " but had a hard time finding equally excited fathers to commiserate with
so he created a space for sharing
he co-founded @entity24 , a literary journal that is an " exploration in fatherhood
" @entity0 is not the only one looking to be a more involved dad
in the last 50 years , fathers have taken on more child care and housework , though women still do the majority , according to a @entity34 study released in march
in 1965 , dads spent an average of 2Â½ hours per week on child care versus mothers ' 10 hours per week
by 2011 , fathers were spending seven hours a week caring for kids , while mothers spent 14
dads are n't who they used to be
@entity0 describes his own father as " an incredibly selfless , loving father " who allowed him room to be himself and let him know he was unconditionally loved , though his dad was not the touchy - feely type
" like most men of his generation , he definitely worked a lot and i know he wishes that had not been the case , " he wrote
" being from a @entity57 , @entity56 family , he was definitely emotionally reserved
i strive to be more emotionally engaged not only with my son but also with myself
" so , if today 's dad is no longer the all - business provider who is less emotionally engaged than @entity64 , and he 's not the bumbling , disconnected dad of the past 30 years in popular culture ( read : @entity68 ) , then who is he ? and do we appreciate him for his sacrifices as much as we do mothers ? let 's hear it for dear old dad @entity75 was listening to a @entity77 sermon at church when she came up with the idea to designate a day to celebrate fathers
her dad , @entity81 , was a @entity82 veteran and a widower who raised her and her five brothers after her mother died
she took her notion to local churches and the @entity89 , and in june 1910 the first @entity90 was celebrated in @entity91 , @entity92
but @entity90 did n't catch on as quickly as @entity77
the holiday did not become official until 1966 when president @entity95 issued a proclamation for dad 's day
by the time president @entity98 signed it into law in 1972 , @entity77 had been a national holiday for 58 years
the foot - dragging is understandable : most mothers share a nine - month - long physical bond with their biological children ; they are typically the emotional touch stone of the family as well as the workhorse of the home , as the march @entity34 study made clear
reverence for @entity64 as the parental nucleus is reflected in how we celebrate @entity77 and @entity90
average spending last year on @entity77 gifts was $ 168.94 , versus $ 119.84 for dads , according to the @entity117
this year , spending for father 's day is up 2.1 % from the previous year , and projected to reach $ 13.2 billion
for @entity77 , that figure is $ 17.1 billion , up .2 % , according to research firm @entity121
paid leave lets dads build parenting foundation dads want it all , too while fathers are contributing more labor at home these days , more women are becoming the chief or sole financial provider of the household in a recovering economy
in a first , mothers currently are the only or primary financial provider in 40 % of homes with children under 18
" women have always had legitimacy in the home , and the women 's movement has given women legitimacy in the workplace , " said professor @entity140 of @entity141
" men have always had legitimacy in the workplace
but have they had a similar credibility in the home ? no. " in the midst of the debate about work - life balance , leaning in and having it all , it is not just women who are examining how their roles have evolved
experts say more value has been placed on mothers , sometimes to the detriment of the critical role fathers play
but men want it all , too , and are recognizing that a better balance means engaging more as a father
" if we 're going to be serious about fatherhood , we need to talk about how they are equally important to the well - being of their child , " said @entity167 , executive director of @entity168 , a nonprofit that encourages " responsible fatherhood " and mentoring
" responsible fatherhood does n't mean anti-motherhood
we are trying to ensure that fathers are nurturing , protective , providers who are a compliment to the child 's mother
" tough choices @entity140 remembered a three - year assignment in @entity183 as one of the highlights of his 20 - year career with computer company @entity187
but in 1993 , he surprised himself when he turned down an opportunity to return to @entity189 for a prestigious job offer after his father was diagnosed with @entity193 's disease
in 1999 , he was married with two children and a baby on the way when another opportunity arose for a stint abroad
this time , family considerations took priority again , and he stayed in @entity201
that was when he realized the outsize impact of family on career choices
at that point , he transitioned out of organizational leadership and moved into academia
the change offered fewer financial rewards , but it provided the chance to do interesting work while living a more balanced life
now , as executive director for the @entity215 at @entity141 , he wants to be a catalyst for discussing how men can make progress on the home front , the way women have in the workplace
" young men are saying i want to be an economic provider but also provide for the emotional needs of my children , " he said
he saw the shift in perspective in his 2011 study , @entity230 : caring , committed and conflicted , which surveyed mainly upper - middle - class white fathers from @entity234 companies
in one measurement asking about the traits of good fathers , respondents placed a higher value on " nontraditional " aspects of fatherhood , including emotional support , being present and teaching rather than discipline , financial security and child care tasks
@entity140 noticed a difference in the evolution of fathers at home and mothers at work
while women were gaining strides in being capable in both work and home life , men , he says , have not done as good a job to gain a foothold in the home
opinion : fathers , stop coddling your kids staying engaged in fatherhood @entity167 , of @entity168 , said the idea of marriage and commitment is not what it was in the 1930s and 1940s
back then there were two things that held a community together : 1
if you had a baby , you had to be married
today , he said , there are no rules
now , census estimates show about half of first marriages end in divorce for women ; the number for men is closer to one - third
unfortunately a new parenting model has not been created to deal with this reality , @entity284 said
" how do you do something in the place of marriage that gets the same outcome ? what you do is start talking about relationships
" he 's a married , churchgoing father of four who maintains relationships with the mothers of his two kids not by his wife
his own early experience and frustrations to peacefully co-parent led him to focus his professional work on fatherhood
for him , it underscored the importance of teaching fathers who are not with their children 's mother how to be involved , and he says it works
" the vast majority of dads ... want to have a positive relationship with their child
most of them are good dads and want to be better dads , " he said
fifty years ago , the idea of a great dad was little more than a father who was a good provider and disciplinarian
today , dads are increasingly looked to as sole or single parents , to support the family emotionally and to help their partners succeed in the wider world
society is n't just expecting more from fathers ; fathers are expecting more from themselves .
