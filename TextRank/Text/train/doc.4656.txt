-- two weeks ago , @entity1 was best known as the youngest @entity3 country , created with much international fanfare in 2011
today , it is possibly the next @entity6
a flash - fire conflict threatening to escalate into full - blown civil war combines trademark elements of @entity3 tragedy -- resource wealth coveted by global powers , in this case oil , and longstanding political and ethnic divisions
here 's a quick primer to get you up to speed on the escalating situation : 1 ) first things first
@entity1 is a landlocked country of more than 11 million people in @entity21 , bordering @entity1 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26
it gained independence from @entity1 on july 9 , 2011 , making it the world 's newest nation after decades of ethnic and political conflict between the @entity1 government in @entity32 and opposition elements in the @entity1
two years later , @entity1 remains one of @entity21 's most impoverished countries despite containing the majority of known @entity1 oil reserves
2 ) who is fighting whom ? the @entity1 government and military , dominated by the @entity43 ethnic group of president @entity44 , is fighting rebels allied with former vice president @entity46 of the @entity48 ethnic group
at stake for now is control of oil - rich regions responsible for more than 95 % of the country 's economy , and perhaps leadership of the country
@entity57 killings and other violence in the past two weeks have caused tens of thousands of people to seek shelter under protection from @entity63 forces in @entity64 , the capital , and some other cities
more @entity63 peacekeepers from @entity21 and perhaps elsewhere may be coming soon , and 150 @entity68 @entity67 are on standby in @entity69 to assist if needed in evacuating @entity68 government and aid workers from the country
3 ) is this something new ? yes and no. while the sudden escalation of the conflict in recent days caught many by surprise , the causes were familiar
@entity1 's independence two years ago followed decades of rebellion by various ethnic and political groups against the @entity32 government in @entity1
@entity44 and @entity46 were longtime rivals who had an uneasy relationship atop the government , with @entity46 making clear his presidential ambitions
the valued oil resources and history of ethnic divisions amounted to a recipe for political mayhem , noted @entity93 , an @entity21 specialist at the @entity94
" it did n't start about oil , " @entity93 told @entity0 on tuesday , adding that the political rivalry at the top was " no secret to anybody
" 4 ) what triggered the recent violence ? @entity44 fired his @entity102 , including @entity46 , in july in a shuffle considered " not uncommon " for such a fledgling @entity3 nation , @entity93 said
while the move caused concern , a relatively calm aftermath bolstered hopes of continued stability
however , that unraveled in mid-december with gunfire between security forces loyal to @entity44 and @entity46
it remains unclear who fired the first shot , according to @entity116
@entity44 accused forces backing @entity46 of launching a coup attempt , and retribution attacks erupted with top allies of @entity121 detained
@entity46 has denied any coup attempt occurred
" it has been surprising in how quickly it spread , " @entity93 said
5 ) where do things stand ? the situation is both dire and uncertain
consider this grim report tuesday from @entity129 of the @entity63 high commissioner for refugees , who said an official saw more than 30 bodies in two mass graves and that the global body was trying to verify the existence of others
" it is very difficult , and there are reports that some bodies may have already been burned , " @entity129 added
the @entity63 said fighting had spread to five of @entity1 's 10 states , and that it had credible reports civilians were being attacked and killed based on their ethnicity
meanwhile , @entity63 officials struggled to make accommodations for some 45,000 people crowding its compounds seeking shelter from the violence
nearly as many people were seeking shelter elsewhere
the @entity154 voted unanimously on tuesday to increase the 6,800 - strong @entity63 force in @entity1 by another 5,500 troops to try to ensure the safety of the displaced , a role that peacekeepers failed to fulfill in the @entity6 genocide of 1994 that killed 800,000 people
" even with additional capabilities , we will not be able to protect every civilian in need in @entity1 , " @entity63 secretary general ban ki - moon warned after the vote , adding that " there is no military solution to this conflict
" on monday , @entity171 said in a message to the people of @entity1 that " the @entity63 stood with you on your road to independence , " and that " we will stay with you now
" 6 ) where does the @entity68 stand ? the @entity68 was one of the strongest supporters of @entity1 's independence for a few reasons
a democratic @entity1 could be a regional hedge against the @entity32 regime , which the @entity68 lists as a sponsor of terrorism , and president @entity185 , who has been indicted on charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide
in addition , the possibility exists of future @entity68 involvement in @entity1 's oil industry
@entity68 oil companies have no role now in @entity1 due to sanctions against @entity1 , which still plays a major role in overall oil production
secretary of state @entity200 has urged @entity44 and @entity46 to enter peace talks , but there was no clear signal that the fighting would ease
@entity200 also dispatched his special envoy to @entity1 and @entity1 , @entity206 , to the country
in a statement monday , the @entity68 military 's @entity208 said it was positioning 150 @entity67 in @entity69 in @entity211 to be able to respond should conditions in @entity1 deteriorate even more
@entity0 @entity214 correspondent @entity213 reported tuesday that 50 of the @entity67 then proceeded to @entity215 , @entity24 , to be even closer to @entity1 if needed
the decision grew out of last year 's experience in @entity218 , @entity219 , when no @entity68 forces were close enough to respond quickly to the attack that killed @entity68 ambassador @entity222 and three other @entity68
according to a senior administration official , 380 @entity68 and about another 300 third - country nationals have been evacuated
" based on registration , there are @entity68 citizens in other towns and areas throughout @entity1 , " the official said
" we are trying to track down how many may still be there
" @entity0 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity213 and @entity235 and journalist @entity236 in @entity64 , @entity1 , contributed to this report .
