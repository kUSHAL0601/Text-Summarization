-- for even the sport 's most ardent fans , @entity1 can be confusing -- it is governed by a set of ever - evolving rules dominated by talk of technical specifications
so if you are a sports enthusiast who is considering checking out the race action when the 2012 season begins in @entity13 on sunday , it is more than likely you will have a few questions
posers such as , " how long can a race go on for ? " or , " why do they use so many tires ? " or maybe even , " why does the front of the car look so weird ? " some of the changes are more technical , the main one involving exhaust diffusion -- a big bone of contention in the past two seasons
in the gallery above , @entity0 has attempted to explain and simplify the host of rule changes which have been brought in ahead of the new campaign so you can fully appreciate all of the elite motorsport 's thrills and spills .
