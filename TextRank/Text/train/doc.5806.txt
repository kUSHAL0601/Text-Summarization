-- a century and a half ago , @entity1 was a humble , forgotten city of about 8,000 people
today , one out of every three @entity3 packs into this city of about 4 million
to avoid the @entity6 crowds , go in the early evening when the marble turns golden as the sun sets
@entity1 has been famous for its sprawl , noise and pollution
my advice has long been to see the big sights , then get out
but visiting it recently to research a new guidebook , i 've seen a dramatic change
the city has made a concerted effort to curb pollution , clean up and pedestrianize the streets , spiff up the museums , build a new airport and invest in one of @entity26 's better public - transit systems
even with its new look , the @entity3 capital still has its " big three " sights : the stunning @entity30 , the @entity31 just below and the remarkable @entity32
but coming in june is the opening of a fourth big sight -- one that will stoke a battle over @entity3 losing her marbles more than 200 years ago ( more on that later )
to many , the most important ancient site in the western world is the @entity30 , rising gleaming like a beacon above the gray concrete drudgery of modern @entity1
this is where the @entity3 built the mighty @entity6 -- the most famous temple on the planet , and an enduring symbol of ancient @entity1 ' glorious @entity49 from nearly 2,500 years ago
the major monuments of the @entity30 survive in remarkably good condition
while the @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 were cruel to the site in the past , the greatest dangers it faces now are acid rain and pollution
ongoing restoration means that you might see some scaffolding -- but even that ca n't take away from its greatness
i like to come late in the day , as the sun goes down , when the white @entity6 stone gleams a creamy golden brown
while the @entity30 was the city 's ceremonial showpiece , it was the @entity31 that was the real heart of classical athens
for some 800 years , it was the hub of all commercial , political , and social life and home to many of the city 's religious rites
@entity81 survives in the @entity31 from the classical period
other than one very well - preserved temple and a rebuilt portico , it 's a field of humble ruins nestled in the shadow of the @entity30
but that makes it a quiet , uncrowded spot to wander and get a feel for the ancients
romantics ca n't help but get goose bumps as they kick around the same pebbles that once stuck in @entity98 ' sandals , with the floodlit @entity6 forever floating ethereally overhead
@entity100 of the city center is the world 's best collection of ancient @entity3 art , the @entity32
it takes you from 7000 @entity107 to a.d. 500 on a beautifully displayed and well - described sweep through @entity3 history , from prehistoric and @entity111 artifacts through the evolution of classical @entity3 statuary
this museum now has a worthy competitor -- the @entity116 , slated to open in june
it 's a world - class space , custom - built to showcase the @entity6 sculptures , along with truckloads of other artifacts , all complemented by modern exhibits
and the state - of - the - art building itself is worth a look , as the boldest symbol yet of the post-olympics vision for @entity1
the new museum also serves as a sort of 21st - century trojan horse , intended to lure the famous @entity131 ( the @entity6 sculptures ) away from @entity134 's @entity133
in the early 19th century , the @entity56 ambassador to the @entity55 , @entity135 , got permission to strip marble panels from the @entity6 and take them to @entity138
for years , the @entity3 have asked for the marbles back , and for years , the @entity140 have responded with claims that @entity3 ca n't give them a suitable home
and yet , now that this state - of - the - art facility is ready and waiting , it still seems unlikely that the marbles will be returned anytime soon
@entity56 is reluctant to give in , for fear of setting a precedent ... and getting " me , too " notices from @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and all the other nations who 'd like the missing pieces of their cultural heritage back
but even without the @entity131 , this new museum will be worth the wait , capturing the timeless splendor of ancient @entity1 in an ultra-modern building
@entity1 is more than a showcase for its past
take some time to smell the souvlaki , whether by wandering through the touristy @entity164 district , browsing through the @entity166 flea market , or exploring the @entity168 neighborhood , the cutting - edge place to go for nightlife and dining
the narrow winding streets can be confusing , but you ca n't get too lost with a monument the size of the @entity30 looming overhead to keep you oriented
and after you visit @entity1 , get out -- to the wild , mountainous landscape of @entity3 's @entity179 , covered in my next column
