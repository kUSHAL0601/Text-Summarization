-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 gets so into character playing @entity4 during debate prep that his performance four years ago sparring with then - @entity2 presidential candidate @entity7 made his wife , @entity8 , run out of the room crying
" part of your responsibility in these debates is to be tougher so the candidate you are helping is ready for the worst of it -- so you have to be mean
you need to get under their skin
sometimes the candidate you are working with does n't appreciate it , and even more often , their family does n't appreciate it , " @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview
@entity1 is the @entity2 ' go - to sparring partner for mock presidential debates
since 2000 , he has played the roles of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity4
5 things to watch in tonight 's debate @entity1 was careful not to discuss his current debate prep with @entity31 , since it is ongoing
still , he said he has never agreed to an interview about his recurring @entity35 role , until now
@entity1 said he spends hours reading , studying and watching everything he can get his hands on to best embody @entity35 and to prepare @entity2 for debates
though he declined to portray his @entity4 imitation , those who have seen it say it is uncanny
" he gets the style down , he gets the substance down , and he can really make you believe that he 's @entity4 , " said @entity43 , a @entity2 debate coach who has worked with @entity1 over the years
" he works very hard to understand every line of argument that the president might make and between those two characteristics , there is n't anyone better , " @entity43 said
@entity2 sources say @entity1 's no - holds - barred style has been especially important during his countless hours with the former @entity57 governor , since @entity31 sources admit one of his potential weak spots is becoming overly defensive , which can result in a gaffe
a @entity31 adviser tells @entity0 his mock debates with @entity1 have gotten so intense that they make a point to build in breaks for him to decompress with his family
inside @entity31 's mock debates , which began a month ago at a friend 's home in rural @entity72 , aides say they do their best to create what spokesman @entity73 calls " game - day conditions
" that means practicing the best way to talk policy , but also making sure the room is set to feel as close to the real thing as possible : two podiums and a moderator , played by longtime @entity31 adviser @entity83
members of @entity31 's inner circle , including @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , then dissect the answers and look for areas of improvement
in debates , presidential candidates ' tics and tells matter @entity43 says it 's impossible to underestimate the importance of the psychological aspect of debate prep
" there 's three things that you have to do to prepare a candidates : they have to know the policy material , they have to know the answers to the questions
the second thing is they have to know the strategy and how to execute it
but the third thing and probably the most important is they have to be mentally prepared
" it 's just like preparing an athlete , if they 're not mentally prepared for the worst of the worst then something will take them by surprise and so those mock debates are extremely important because i look at it like a batter in the on deck circle , they swing a heavy bat or a bat with a weight on it so that when they get in the batter 's box the bat feels lighter , " @entity43 explained
part of the prep is not just what @entity31 says ; it 's how he acts and reacts
@entity1 remembers preparing to play @entity25 in mock debates with @entity137 during the 2000 campaign , and noticing that @entity25 got unusually physically close to his opponent , @entity139
so @entity1 , acting as @entity25 , invaded @entity137 's personal space during rehearsal
" governor @entity137 's reaction was , ' he is not going to do that , that is ridiculous , ' and sure enough in that last debate , which was the one we were prepping for , @entity25 did just that
i saw governor @entity137 smile
i wonder if he was smiling saying ' @entity151 , @entity1 was right ' or if he was just smiling at @entity25 , but he handled it well , " @entity1 recalled
@entity43 , who was brought into the @entity31 campaign after a few underwhelming debate performances during the @entity2 primaries , says the candidate is extremely responsive to critiques
@entity159 : debate all about trust for @entity31 " he is a great student of political debate
he works very hard at it , so i think that he is absolutely coachable
he was able to do things across the debates , change a strategy , that let him win a majority of these debates , " @entity43 said
@entity43 considers the @entity0 debate in @entity170 , @entity171 , one of @entity31 's great debate moments -- when @entity174 refused to criticize @entity31 about lacking transparency as the former speaker had so often done on the campaign trail
@entity31 jumped in and asked , " would n't it be nice if people did n't make accusations somewhere else that they are n't willing to defend here ? " " it took @entity184 's argument and showed the absurdity in one line , " @entity43 said
" it created a moment in the debate where through one line , he could capture the imagination of the press , capture the imagination of the audience , and make a point -- make a strong point that crystallized that entire debate in one line , and that 's what governor @entity31 has to be looking for now , " @entity43 said
@entity2 sources say @entity31 has been working up a few one liners to get his points across , but @entity43 also said he hoped the @entity31 campaign is n't also practicing " zingers " as the @entity203 reported over the weekend
" it 's not about zingers , " @entity43 said
" a zinger might be just something funny , a comedic line , something to sort of break the monotony of the debate to try and capture the imagination , " he said
" it 's something that 's sort of shoehorned into the debate
" but a good line , @entity214 's line about his opponent 's youth and age , not making that an issue , a good line is a substantive line that does capture the imagination of the press and the audience , to overrun and deliver the message that you want and do it at the expense of your opponent
" @entity229 : ' @entity230 ' is always with @entity31 at the debates
