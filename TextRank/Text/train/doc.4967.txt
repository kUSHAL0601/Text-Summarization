@entity14 , @entity15 : an economic face - off , a special graduation speaker , and a look at what happened on this day in history
i 'm @entity22 , and @entity0 is ready to take flight
first up : @entity24 unidentified @entity25 announcer : ... liftoff for the final launch of @entity28
expanding our knowledge , expanding our lives in space
@entity33 : the space shuttle endeavour taking off on its final endeavor
the launch was delayed due to mechanical problems , but @entity25 officials said those were all fixed
the shuttle and its crew are headed to the international space station
this is a 16 - day mission and the next - to - the - last mission for the space shuttle program
@entity46 has flown on @entity28 before
on that mission , she became the first @entity50 - @entity49 woman to travel into space
she said yesterday 's launch brought up mixed emotions
@entity46 , former astronaut : it 's very bittersweet , because it was a wonderful , beautiful launch
i was on the second mission of @entity28
when we spoke last year , we were there talking about the fact that the shuttle era was coming to an end , and now the @entity49 was putting more of its research money into how to do interplanetary travel , how to come up with the kinds of engines that are needed to go , to taking us to an asteroid
so , that transition is great , but it 's sort of hard to see the shuttle program ending
@entity72 @entity73 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity76 's business class at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 ! which of these words means failing to make required payments on time ? is it : a ) arbitration , b ) bankruptcy , c ) collusion or @entity88 ) default ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! when you default , it means you have n't made your payments on time
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity96 @entity33 : there 's a chance the @entity49 government could default on its debt , money that it has borrowed
@entity102 actually sets a limit on how much money the government can borrow
it 's called the debt ceiling
it 's kind of like the limit on a credit card : once you 've maxed out , you ca n't borrow any more
and the government is there , at that maxed - out limit : $ 14.294 trillion
if it ca n't borrow any more money , the government might not be able to pay its bills
that 's not a good thing
treasury secretary @entity118 told @entity102 yesterday that there are ways to keep things running for a few months , but he 's urging lawmakers to raise the country 's debt ceiling
that 's something lawmakers have been debating for a while now
@entity128 looks at some of the arguments from both sides
( begin video ) @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , @entity136 : @entity137 want trillions in cuts and no tax hikes
@entity141 say tax hikes should be included in the mix. and they caution against tying the debt limit too closely to deficit reduction
@entity146 , white house press secretary : we believe that we can reach an agreement on significant deficit reduction within the same time frame that @entity102 needs to take action to raise the debt ceiling
but it simply would be folly , as i 've said before , to say that if we do n't get an agreement , or if we do n't get the agreement we want , then we 're just not going to raise the debt ceiling , come what may
lake : as politicians squabble , treasury secretary @entity118 has vowed to take " extraordinary measures " to allow the @entity49 to continue paying its creditors , including borrowing from federal pension plans
because of this , the @entity49 will not default on its debt immediately
but @entity118 says he 'll run out of options in early august
many in the @entity169 believe @entity102 must act by then , and creditors will be watching every step of the way
creditors like @entity174 , which holds more than $ 1 trillion worth of @entity49 treasuries , and @entity176 , which holds more than $ 890 billion worth of debt
over the years , the @entity49 has been forced to raise the debt ceiling 74 times since 1962 to pay for tax cuts , foreign wars and other spending increases
in fiscal year 2000 , total national debt stood at $ 5.5 trillion
since then , debt has almost tripled
most in @entity185 agree , not raising the debt ceiling , and defaulting on debt , would trigger a spike in borrowing rates and a loss of confidence in the ability of the @entity49 government to honor its obligations
a high stakes game of political chicken is underway , and the national debt clock is ticking
@entity197 , @entity0 , @entity136
( @entity198 ) this day in history @entity33 : on this day in history , may 17th , in 1792 , 24 stockbrokers and merchants signed the @entity203
in 1875 , @entity206 rode @entity207 to victory
it was the first running of the @entity210 , now one of the world 's most famous horse races
and in 1954 , the @entity49 @entity214 ruled on the case of @entity216 vs. @entity217 , saying that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional
border violence @entity33 : increased tension around the nation of @entity4 after protesters who support the @entity225 people fought with @entity4 forces on sunday
the violence broke out on " @entity228
" @entity229 is arabic for " catastrophe
" the day marks the time in 1948 when @entity231 were moved out of their homes after @entity4 was established
at least 12 people were killed in the fighting on sunday
hundreds of others were injured
officials from @entity237 and @entity238 -- two of @entity4 's neighbors -- accused @entity4 troops of firing on protesters
@entity4 said the protesters were illegally crossing the border
@entity4 's prime minister said he hoped for a quick , peaceful resolution
but he added that @entity4 is determined to defend its borders
@entity49 & @entity5 @entity33 : there 's also been some tension between the @entity49 and @entity5 recently , especially after @entity49 forces killed terrorist leader @entity250 in @entity5
the country accused the @entity49 of violating @entity5 law by launching the attack on @entity250 inside of @entity5 borders
the @entity49 has questioned how @entity250 lived near a @entity5 military academy without being discovered
yesterday , @entity49 senator @entity256 , who 's the chairman of the @entity257 , traveled to @entity5
during the visit , he said the @entity49 does n't need to apologize for the raid that killed @entity250
but he said that it 's important for the two countries to find a way to resolve their differences , and he pointed out that the @entity49 and @entity5 still share the same goal
sen. @entity256 , ( @entity88 ) @entity265 : we must never lose sight of this central fact : we are strategic partners with a common enemy in terrorism and extremism
both of our countries have sacrificed too many citizens and troops in the fight , and many too many to consider abandoning this important relationship for one reason or another
far too much is at stake here
@entity280 @entity33 : @entity281 in @entity6 , @entity7 had a high - profile graduation speaker for this year 's ceremony : president @entity284
he was there because the school won this year 's @entity287
public high schools across the country were judged on how they prepare students for college and for careers
@entity293 used this video to show off some of the school 's achievements
that includes test scores higher than the state average and the school 's dramatically improved graduation rate
at yesterday 's commencement , president @entity284 said that @entity293 's progress should be an example for schools around the @entity49 @entity49 president @entity284 : today , @entity293 is a place that has proven why we ca n't accept excuses -- any excuses -- when it comes to education
in the @entity49 , we should never accept anything less than the best that our children have to offer
before we go @entity33 : before we go , we offer for you a little case of identity crisis
golden retrievers are supposed to hunt ducks
this one adopted them ! they even follow her around , as if she 's their mother
for instance , when it gets warm outside , they all cool off by pooling their resources
though with any other retriever , these feathered friends would be duck soup
the retriever will raise them for two months with dogged determination before they leave the nest ... or the pool
goodbye @entity33 : of course , the dog could 've ducked that kind of responsibility , but that kind of behavior would n't fit the bill
oh yeah : duck puns ! you ca n't deny it : they quack you up
i 'm @entity22 , and i 'm out !
