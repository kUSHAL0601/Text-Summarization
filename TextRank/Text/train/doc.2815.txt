" @entity57 said it was not clear who was responsible for the attack , which occurred mid-afternoon
" this is an area where you have so many different types of armed people , " she said
" people have different aims and different reasons to carry arms and to perpetrate attack
so this is a very complex environment
we just ca n't fingerpoint any group
