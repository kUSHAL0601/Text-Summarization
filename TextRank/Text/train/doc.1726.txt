@entity0 -- on tuesday , for the second time this month , the @entity3 field will debate foreign policy , a topic that has n't seen much attention in the race until now
the candidates will be fighting an uphill battle against the president 's strong record on national security
president @entity14 has racked up an impressive series of foreign policy victories and promises kept : he ordered a daring raid that resulted in the death of @entity20 and has taken out scores of top @entity23 leaders , including lead recruiter @entity24
he brought the @entity26 war to a close , as promised , and has started a responsible withdrawal from @entity29
without putting a single @entity32 soldier on the ground and for only about a thousandth of the cost of the @entity26 war , the president helped the @entity37 people oust @entity38 , a ruthless dictator who supported terrorists
@entity14 has also led the international community in putting the squeeze on @entity43 's leaders through tough sanctions and ratified the new start treaty negotiated with @entity46
voters have recognized these successes
polls show the public backs @entity14 's pragmatic , results - based approach to foreign policy
fulfilling his promise to end the @entity26 war is the president 's most popular move : more than three in four @entity32 -- 77 % -- approve of @entity14 's decision to withdraw @entity32 troops from @entity26 by the end of the year , according to @entity62 polling
in addition , 63 % approve of the president 's terrorism policies , turning what was expected to be a weakness into a strength
the @entity3 field has responded to the president 's successful efforts abroad with what the @entity73 editorial board called " bad analysis and worse solutions , nothing that suggests real understanding or new ideas
" instead of taking seriously the need for the commander in chief to have at least a basic knowledge of the world , @entity3 have embraced their lack of experience on the issue
@entity87 made a telling gaffe last week when he insisted that he is " not supposed to know anything about foreign policy
" the @entity3 running to lead the country do n't seem to understand that the president ca n't plead ignorance
international crises especially require quick , effective decision - making -- presidents do n't have time to study up on @entity98 101
the lack of knowledge or experience has n't stopped republicans from falling into a familiar habit : opposition for the sake of opposition
if @entity14 favors something , @entity3 almost certainly oppose it
@entity108 originally built his argument against @entity14 's foreign policy by attacking the new @entity112 treaty -- an agreement supported by every living @entity3 secretary of state and our entire current military leadership
now @entity108 , along with others , is calling for bombing @entity43 , an action that former @entity120 commander four - star gen. @entity119 has said would " drag us into a conflict
" @entity14 has effectively rallied other nations for the strongest sanctions ever against @entity43 's nuclear program
@entity3 have lots of ideas about starting new wars , but few about how to keep meaningful pressure on @entity130
regarding @entity132 , the @entity3 field has routinely condemned @entity14 's leadership in trying to avert a crisis over the @entity136 request for statehood at the @entity139 @entity14 's policies have made @entity132 safer
@entity132 prime minister @entity140 praised @entity14 for his handling of the rescue of the @entity132 diplomats in @entity144 in september
the candidates continue to take any position that will distance them from the president and allow them to sound tough -- but it 's putting them out of step with military leaders and nonpartisan national security experts
much of the field has endorsed waterboarding -- widely considered torture -- and many have argued for cutting off all foreign aid
both of those positions are opposed by generals such as @entity160 and @entity161 as well as fellow republicans , including former defense secretary @entity163 and sen. @entity164
abandoning our values and " soft power " means abandoning leadership in the world
in addition , the field has tried to turn the phrase " leading from behind " into an overarching criticism of @entity14 's foreign policy
that rather inaccurate term was coined to explain @entity14 's response to the situation in @entity37
it 's funny that @entity3 would latch onto the phrase , because they 've shown a distinct lack of judgment and resolve on the issue
@entity184 of @entity185 documented that @entity108 has held five different positions on the @entity37 operation
it is probably @entity190 's most blatant flip - flop ; the former @entity192 speaker first endorsed intervention , then said he would n't have acted
the @entity3 field just ca n't admit that @entity14 got this right
even more telling than the issues candidates have talked about are the issues that have been downplayed
the last debate included little or no mention of post-war @entity26 , ignored the security implications of @entity204 's rise , and only at the last minute began to explore candidates ' thinking on the @entity208 financial crisis
twenty - first - century problems require 21st - century thinking
the @entity3 have displayed stunningly little of such thinking so far
expect lots of bluster and loose talk at tuesday 's debate , the sort that brought us the @entity26 war earlier this century while the search for @entity20 was essentially called off
then compare it to the pragmatic , effective approach of @entity14 and his list of accomplishments
it 's clear who should be on the receiving end of the 3 a.m. phone call
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .
