-- as the global population hits 7 billion in the coming days , nations can take steps to tackle critical challenges and prepare for the arrival of billions more people this century , the @entity1 said wednesday
the milestone is expected to be reached on october 31
" with planning and the right investments in people now ... our world of 7 billion can have thriving , sustainable cities , productive labor forces that can fuel economic growth , youth populations that contribute to the well - being of economies and societies , and a generation of older people who are healthy and actively engaged in the social and economic affairs of their communities , " @entity27 , the @entity27 , said in a new report
among the steps the report focuses on are empowering young people with economic opportunities ; planning for the growth of cities ; developing programs to share and sustain the @entity35 's resources ; and improving education , including sexual education
a @entity1 report published in may predicts a global population of 9.3 billion by 2050 , and more than 10 billion by the end of this century
" with only a small variation in fertility , particularly in the more populous countries , the total could be higher : 10.6 billion people could be living on @entity35 by 2050 and more than 15 billion in 2100 , " says the @entity41 of the @entity1 @entity42
much of the increase will come in @entity49 and @entity50
in light of growing concerns about the global economy , the new @entity27 report highlights financial dangers facing people in industrialized and developing nations
" while labor shortages threaten to stymie the economies of some industrialized countries , unemployed would - be migrants in developing countries are finding more and more national borders closed to them and the expertise they may have to offer
and while progress is being made in reducing extreme poverty , gaps between rich and poor are widening almost everywhere
" the 7 billion mark is a huge spike from less than a century ago
in 1927 , the global population was 2 billion
it was only 13 years ago that the population was at 6 billion , the @entity1 says
changing demographics are quickly reshaping the world in numerous ways
people under the age of 25 make up 43 % of the world 's population , the @entity1 says
about half of the world 's population lives in cities
within about 35 years , two - thirds will , it says
while reaching 7 billion in 2011 has long been predicted , the new @entity1 report wednesday -- " @entity83 " -- highlights changes and trends to offer a complex picture
in a summary of the report , the agency notes that " women are on average having fewer children than they were in the 1960s
" the number of children a woman is expected to have dropped from an average of 6 to 2.5 , the report says
but there are far more women than there were in the 1960s
" in some of the poorest countries , high fertility rates hamper development and perpetuate poverty , while in some of the richest countries , low fertility rates and too few people entering the job market are raising concerns about prospects for sustained economic growth and the viability of social security systems , " the summary says
a few more facts and figures from the report : -- today there are 893 million people over the age of 60 ; by the middle of the century , that number will rise to 2.4 billion
-- @entity50 will remain the most populous area this century , but @entity49 " will gain ground as its population more than triples , increasing from 1 billion in 2011 to 3.6 billion in 2100
" -- the combined population of other areas -- including the @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 -- is currently 1.7 billion , and is expected to rise to nearly 2 billion by 2060 , " then decline very slowly
