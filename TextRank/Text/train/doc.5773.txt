-- the northern @entity3 school where a teenage boy died while tackling a suicide bomber last week will be renamed in his honor , a top provincial official announced monday
the school will be named after @entity9 , the 14 - year - old boy who authorities say saved an untold number of fellow students by sacrificing himself at the building 's main gate , @entity8 's chief minister said during a provincial assembly session
the ninth - grader was on his way to school january 6 in the province 's @entity21 district when the bomber , dressed in a school uniform , asked him where the school was , the teen 's cousin @entity16 said
@entity9 challenged the bomber and tried to catch him , and the bomb detonated when the two scuffled , the cousin said
@entity9 and the bomber died at the scene
witnesses said the blast injured two other people
@entity34 , a @entity21 district police officer , confirmed the details of the attack to @entity0
@entity21 is a troubled district bordering @entity3 's tribal areas
it is rife with sectarian violence , with attacks against @entity42 and @entity43
on friday , @entity3 prime minister @entity44 nominated @entity9 for the @entity45 -- the country 's top civil award for bravery
the same honor was given to @entity50 , a @entity3 schoolgirl who survived being shot in the head in 2012 by the @entity52 for her efforts to promote education for boys and girls
the award is worth about $ 50,000 to @entity9 's family
a separate civilian martyr package provides another $ 5,000 in compensation
@entity0 's @entity61 and @entity62 contributed to this report .
