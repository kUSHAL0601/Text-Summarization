the @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 has 85 shiny new submachine guns , locked and loaded
they 've long had a small police force , and they 're not alone , thanks to a mostly forgotten provision in the behemoth 2002 @entity9 that allows certain the @entity1 of inspector general to equip themselves with agents who carry guns
criminal investigators at agencies like the @entity2 , the @entity16 and @entity17 can carry firearms
the @entity2 first gained the permanent ability to arm its criminal investigators in 1981
twenty - five other federal agencies gained that permanent ability in 2002 as result of the @entity9
at 73 federal agencies and departments , independent sub-agencies called the @entity1 , or @entity26 , conduct oversight , perform audits and enforce laws
it is that last function that led the @entity2 to order the .40 - caliber " submachine guns " in may
a spokesman for @entity33 told @entity34 that these " semi-automatic " weapons were acquired on september 9 , 2014
the @entity37 's @entity1 put out a similar purchase order in 2010 for 27 shotguns
surprisingly , @entity40 does not know how many and what type of weapons the agencies have been stockpiling , according to @entity44 rep. @entity44 of @entity45
he wants a @entity47 report on the issue and has introduced legislation this year to strip the @entity50 of their guns
" @entity0 do n't see why dozens of federal agencies need their own highly armed police forces with the authority to raid homes and businesses , " @entity44 told @entity34
so why do investigators at agencies better known for meat inspections and processing crop insurance claims need automatic weapons ? " regarding the need for weapons ' procurements , @entity1 's investigations division conducts hundreds of criminal investigations each year , some of which involve @entity1 agents , @entity2 employees , and / or members of the public facing potentially life threatening situations , " @entity2 deputy counsel @entity58 said
while the @entity2 has long had gun carrying agents , many other agencies did not have those law enforcement powers prior to a 2002 law meant to correct for the poor law enforcement coordination prior to september 11
one of the changes was section 812 that turned these additional inspector general offices into permanent law enforcement agencies
prior to that , some of the @entity88 had to ask for special permission -- citing specific need to carry firearms -- from the @entity0 attorney general
these were granted on an ad hoc basis and almost universally , but they had to be renewed
the 2002 @entity9 codified these law enforcement powers and the right for agents of the @entity88 to carry firearms
the agencies efforts to stock weapons and ammunition caught the eye of curious lawmakers in 2013 when the @entity104 held a subcommittee hearing
the hearing revealed that the @entity107 has 290 investigators who carry firearms , but for the past two decades , those agents have only fired their guns twice in the line of duty
but agencies are getting some use of their police gear
last year , the @entity117 launched a criminal investigation into an @entity120 gold mine for potential violations of the @entity122
they sent 10 officers ( five from the @entity117 who carried shotguns ) in bulletproof vests , according to a review of the incident by the state of @entity120
no charges have been levied
in 2011 , the @entity132 conducted armed raids of an @entity135 farm searching for raw - milk related infractions
in justifying the need for @entity107 's audit arm to carry guns , @entity107 's inspector general @entity138 cited a standoff with a murder suspect
but @entity138 acknowledged @entity144 accompanied @entity107 's agents in that pursuit
rep. @entity44 thinks that law enforcement - specific agencies should take the lead , not regulators
" when there are genuinely dangerous situations involving federal law , that 's the job of the @entity156 , not regulatory agencies like the @entity132 or the @entity37 , " @entity44 said
@entity158 , president of @entity160 - to - @entity161 , whose members have been raided by the @entity132 , said agents have even pointed their guns at unarmed food producers suspected of permit violations
" these people do n't need their own enforcement teams
" " they have the @entity170 at their disposal , if there really is a problem , " @entity169 told @entity34
@entity2 's inspector general office confirmed to @entity34 that the majority enforcement actions -- arrest and search warrants -- are done in conjunction with another federal , state or other law enforcement agency
according to a 2012 report by the @entity156 's statistics arm , there were over 3500 gun - wielding agents assigned to the various offices of inspector general as of 2008 , including 52 at @entity17 , 34 at the @entity16 , six at the @entity187 , and 28 at the @entity188 , the federal government 's hr wing .
