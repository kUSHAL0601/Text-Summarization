[ previous story , published at 10:51 p.m. et ] ( @entity1 ) -- police in the @entity4 capital of @entity0 were stopping cars and cordoning off sections of the city sunday morning after two shootings within hours of each other left two people dead and five wounded
it was unclear whether the shootings were connected , police said
no one has been arrested and police are working as if there might be more than one gunman
officers were searching taxis and private cars , having the drivers open their vehicle trunks as the city was on high alert , @entity33 , a reporter for @entity8 in @entity4 , reported
a police spokesman said there is no ban on civilians moving around , but they should respect police roadblocks
the second incident took place about 10 hours after a deadly terror attack
in the latest incident , shots were fired near a synagogue when a person approached two police officers and began shooting
another person was shot and later died , and the police officers were wounded -- one in an arm , the other in a leg , police said
their injuries were n't life - threatening
police earlier said the gunman ran from the scene
the shooter was a man dressed in a light gray jacket , black pants and black shoes
the jacket was different from the one believed to have worn by a possible suspect in the first shooting
earlier , a gunman stormed a cafe where controversial cartoonist @entity77 and his supporters had gathered for a free speech forum , killing a man and wounding three police officers before fleeing , police said
@entity82 -- founder of the @entity83 , created two years ago in support of the @entity86 cartoonist whose portrayals of the @entity88 angered many in the @entity91 world -- told @entity1 that security personnel on site moved her and others to safe areas after shots rang out
she and @entity77 ended up in a storage room together , holding hands , until police told them it was ok to come out
" we have never taken any chances , " @entity82 said , referring to the heavy security from police , @entity4 intelligence services and @entity77 ' own security guards at this and other committee events
" what we have so much been frightened would happen happened
" why @entity91 forbids images of @entity88 after the attack , what appeared to be the man , dressed in dark clothes , carjacked a civilian 's dark @entity116 and drove away , @entity4 police said
that vehicle was found between two train stations
the gunman remained at large saturday night
police initially had said there were two shooters in the first incident
the discrepancy was caused by chaos in the aftermath of the incident , @entity0 police spokesman @entity125 said
the 55 - year - old man who was killed has n't been identified
nor have authorities identified the three wounded law enforcement officers -- two with @entity4 intelligence and one police officer -- though investigator @entity136 did say none of them suffered serious injuries
given @entity141 extremists ' documented threats against @entity142 and their willingness to act on similar threats -- as proven last month in @entity145 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity146 said , " everything points to ... the shooting in @entity149 ( being ) a political assassination and therefore a terror attack
" @entity146 vowed that " all resources will be used to find ( those responsible ) and bring them before a judge " for an attack she said filled her " with deep anger
" " we have some difficult days ahead , " the prime minister said
" ... but in @entity4 , we will never bow to violence
" about 30 people -- including @entity77 and @entity145 ambassador to @entity4 @entity162 , who tweeted later that he is " still alive in the room " -- went through airport - level security to get into saturday 's event at the building located in what @entity82 described as a " very peaceful area " of the @entity4 capital
but it did n't last long , with noise erupting just a few minutes in
@entity172 , a satire researcher and @entity4 university professor , said he heard about 30 shots at about 3:30 p.m. ( 9:30 a.m. et ) , as well as someone yelling in a foreign language
" everybody , of course , panicked in the room and tried to run , " @entity172 told @entity1
" ... we were just hiding ... and hoping for the best
" the attacker made it just inside the building but apparently got no farther , said @entity82 , a journalist and literary critic
she recalled how one man there " acted very quickly and courageously " by pushing a woman down to the ground , then putting himself on top of her so she would n't get shot
bodyguards returned fire , the @entity0 police official said
at one point , two people came running into the meeting room -- one of them bleeding from the leg , after having apparently been shot -- to " tell us to calm down , " @entity172 said
sirens could be heard 10 to 15 minutes after the shots , at which point @entity172 said " we started to feel more safe
" the discussion on free speech even resumed , though eventually all those at the event were bused to a local police station
@entity0 police later tweeted a picture of the suspect , covered up and dressed in dark clothes , wanted in connection with the attack
" we are investigating this as a terror attack , " said @entity136 , the police official , noting that authorities are taking into account that both the @entity145 ambassador and @entity77 attended saturday 's event
" there is an extremely large presence of police in @entity0 right now
" @entity4 in @entity0 and beyond quickly got support from around the world , including from the mayor of @entity225 -- who just more than a month ago lived this same nightmare during the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine @entity230 in her city
" in the name of @entity235 , " mayor @entity233 tweeted , " i express my full support
" like @entity230 editor @entity237 , @entity77 was one of nine faces on a " @entity243 " graphic published by @entity241 's @entity240 for " crimes against @entity91
" others include a pair of @entity4 journalists who published 12 cartoons depicting @entity88 in the @entity251 - @entity250 newspaper ; @entity254 pastor @entity253 , who burned a quran ; and " @entity256 " author @entity252
because of that , @entity82 said , " there 's no doubt " the @entity0 event was targeted because of @entity77 , who has " not been able to live a normal life " for years , according to the committee
" this is ... why we set up the committee : to support mr. @entity77 and support his right to freedom of speech , " @entity82 said
@entity142 became a target after his 2007 cartoon depicting @entity88 with the body of a dog -- an animal that conservative @entity273 consider unclean
in a @entity1 interview later that year from his home in rural @entity86 , @entity77 said the drawing was calculated to elicit a reaction
" it should be possible to insult all religions in a democratic way , " he said then
" if you insult one ( religion ) , then you should insult the other ones
