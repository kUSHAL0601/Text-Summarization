-- @entity1 said it has launched an investigation into the 15 - vehicle wreck that claimed the life of driver @entity5 and expects to have preliminary findings within weeks
the organization said wednesday individual members of various motorsports bodies will help it determine factors involved in the fiery incident sunday at the @entity12
@entity1 said it had incorrectly stated tuesday that the @entity13 of the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) and the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , the national and international governing organizations , were formally involved in the investigation
the violent crash raised fresh questions about safety , both in motor sports , generally , and at the @entity12 track , specifically
@entity5 , a two - time @entity23 winner , had been pressing efforts to address such concerns
in an early october story posted on @entity28 , the racing series ' official website , @entity1 vice president @entity26 singled out the 33 - year - old driver , his team and @entity34 manufacturer @entity33 for their efforts to fine - tune a safer car model for the 2012 season
weeks ago , @entity5 was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the @entity1 racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer
" he 's focused on what 's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to @entity33 and be consistent and concise , " @entity26 said then of @entity5
" you could n't have asked for more
" had he won sunday 's race , the @entity48 with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $ 5 million payout
instead , he was near the back of the 34 - car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames , spewing smoke and debris
@entity1 on tuesday said it was saddened by @entity5 's death
" the safety of our drivers , their crews , @entity1 staff , racetrack staff and spectators is always our paramount concern , " @entity1 said in a statement , declining to comment further on the probe
a public memorial service for @entity5 will be held on sunday at the @entity73 in downtown @entity74 , @entity1 said
a fund has been established to help provide for his family
@entity5 was survived by his wife , @entity79 , and two young sons
two drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- @entity83 and @entity84 -- were released monday from the @entity85 in @entity12 , said @entity1
@entity5 's death was the first for the @entity1 circuit since march 2006 , when driver @entity89 was killed in a two - car crash while warming up for the season - opening race at @entity92
one of the most famous racing deaths was that of the elder @entity95 in @entity97 's @entity96
@entity99 senior writer @entity98 said monday that the sheer speed of race cars , and the minimal distance separating them , means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway
@entity5 , for example , was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 mph when sunday 's crash occurred
" the fact of the matter is , you 're dealing with very , very fast automobiles
they 're not heavy cars , " @entity98 said
" there is , unfortunately , an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars
" beyond questions about racing 's safety generally , the condition of the @entity126 -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after @entity5 's death
driver @entity132 told @entity133 that the track offered " nowhere to get away from anybody
" " this is not a suitable track , and we 've seen it today , " he said
the loop in @entity12 is 1.5 miles , one mile shorter than the iconic @entity140
at the same time , it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside , and potentially collide with , one another
@entity0 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .
