-- as @entity4 consumers shift their drinking habits away from bars and into their homes , industry giants such as @entity2 are looking at ways to adapt
beer sales in bars and restaurants - traditionally the primary outlets for the @entity15 brewer 's products - have fallen sharply across the continent in recent years
as a result , @entity2 recorded a 4.6 % drop in sales in 2010 , down to â ‚ ¬ 7.89 billion ( $ 11.3 billion )
@entity20 , president of @entity2 's @entity22 division , is now looking for way to reflect consumer 's changing needs as the company looks to arrest the drop
he has helped to implement a strategy he hopes will align the brewing giant with the demands of modern @entity4 consumers
a key component of the transition so far has seen @entity2 move away from its traditional focus on bars and restaurants as primary points of sale
a series of partnerships and promotions with supermarkets such as @entity44 's @entity43 have been established - providing direct access to the home consumer market
initial results of the link up are promising
@entity2 recorded sales 3 % higher at @entity43 stores than at any other outlet in the last year
the key is products which are easier to consume at home , such as a can to drink on the terrace , or a bottle to have with a meal
the aim , @entity20 said , is " to cover all the consumer moments
" @entity20 is careful , however to maintain a long term definition of success
" it is a journey , " he says
" it takes time to build a brand
