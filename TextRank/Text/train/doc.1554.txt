-- when the stirring speeches , heavyweight debates and fevered campaigning of the @entity7 elections are long forgotten , a handful of far less noble incidents are likely to be our enduring memories of the 2008 @entity11 race
" @entity13 , i 'm @entity14 and i 'm a celebrity too
" while the candidates would like us to view their bids for the top job as an honorable battle of wits , policies , values and big issues , the sad truth is that it 's more likely to boil down to a list of gaffes , embarrassments and sideshows
both @entity30 and @entity31 pr machines have been working hard to keep their campaigns on - script , but with a cast list of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 , they had their work cut out
alaskan " hockey mom " @entity38 's late arrival undoubtedly stirred things up , adding a dash of vigor as the race lumbered into its final straight , but even before she began stealing the show , there was no shortage of scrapbook moments
sound off : which do you think are the most memorable moments from the 2008 election ? in no particular order , here is a selection of some of the best : 1
crying game : back in january 's @entity63 primaries , @entity61 welled up with emotion , almost crying into her coffee cup during a chat with voters
this unexpected exposure of her human side was credited with winning back some women supporters
@entity35 bombs : @entity35 displayed rather off - key singing and diplomacy skills when asked if there was a plan to attack @entity76 back in april 2007
changing the words to the classic @entity79 ' song " @entity80 , " the @entity82 senator responded : " bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb @entity76
pastor disaster : proving once again that religion and politics do n't mix , @entity36 was forced to distance himself from his former pastor and mentor @entity88 , after a series of pulpit fulminations in which he made racially - charged criticisms of @entity61 and said of the 9/11 terror attacks : " @entity7 's chickens are coming home to roost
@entity97 ' man : garrulous " gaffe machine " @entity37 got the last word in a primary debate about his tendency to speak his mind and not shut up
asked if he could hold his tongue enough to " reassure your voters in this country that you have the discipline you would need on the world stage , " @entity37 replied succinctly : " yes
the pig issue : @entity36 may have been hoping to generate oinks of outrage when he commented in september that @entity35 's policies were like " lipstick on a pig , " after the @entity82 senator named @entity38 as running mate
the @entity30 candidate refused to apologize for what @entity31 said was a misogynistic response to @entity38 's own claim to be a pitbull in lipstick
you could n't make it up
@entity124 - firing : @entity61 had her campaign guns blazing in march when she described the drama of a visit to @entity128 12 years earlier
" i remember landing under sniper fire , " she said
@entity130 was later forced to admit " misspeaking " after video footage of the event showed her strolling leisurely from the aircraft
@entity134 : first there was @entity37 , then there was @entity38 's mythical beer swiller @entity138 and finally there was @entity140 -- just a regular guy worried about his business going down the drain
despite not actually being a licensed plumber , and not even being called @entity145 , he has been seized on by @entity35 as an everyman hero
this endorsement sprung more leaks when @entity145 failed to appear on cue to a recent @entity35 event
bad business : neither presidential candidate makes claim to being psychic , but @entity35 might have done better consulting his tea leaves rather than the advisors who led him to say " the fundamentals of our economy are strong " on the eve of @entity7 's worst financial crisis since the @entity161
@entity162 : her political skills aside , moose - shooting @entity38 has been an unfortunately prolific headline generator for the @entity31 campaign , whether eyeing @entity167 from her @entity169 home , shopping for suits , stumbling over questions from @entity172 or introducing her pregnant teenage daughter
@entity36 = @entity174 : celebrity endorsements are one thing , but @entity35 's campaign ad comparing his rival to pop star @entity180 and heiress @entity14 was seen by at least one person as taking things a little too far
a swimsuit - clad @entity183 responded by launching her own campaign for the presidency : " @entity13 , i 'm @entity14 and i 'm a celebrity too
only i 'm not from the olden days and i 'm not promising change like that other guy
i 'm just hot ! " read more
