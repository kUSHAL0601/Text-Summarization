-- @entity1 announced tuesday that it is granting " amnesty " to protesters accused of committing crimes
but a report published by the state - run news agency seemed to suggest the protesters were not actually being offered amnesty , as in a general pardon , but were having their punishments for alleged crimes decreased
an announcement on state - run television said @entity1 president @entity15 issued a decree granting amnesty to protesters arrested for crimes committed before tuesday
the amnesty includes " all of those who belong to various political movements including the @entity25 , " the alert on state tv said
the announcement came after weeks of @entity1 officials describing some protesters as " terrorists " trying to destabilize the country
a report tuesday on the website of @entity32 , @entity1 's state news agency , said that in addition to granting general amnesty , @entity15 's decree " also pardons half penalties for felonies if there was no personal claim
" the report says @entity41 1 of @entity15 's decree grants " general amnesty for all crimes committed before may 31 , 2011 , according to the following
" it then lists changes in punishments
the death penalty will be replaced with a " life sentence of hard labor or long imprisonment sentence according to the crime , " a life sentence of hard work will be replaced with " 20 years imprisonment with hard labor , " and so on
a call to the @entity57 in @entity58 for clarification was not immediately returned
@entity32 also carried a story tuesday with the headline : " @entity62 and security forces arrest members of armed terrorist groups in @entity66 , seize massive amounts of weapons and ammo
" the @entity1 uprising , part of the so - called @entity72 in which protesters throughout much of the @entity74 and @entity75 have taken to the streets calling for reforms , has been met with a fierce crackdown by the government
roughly 830 people have been killed in the protests , according to the @entity82
that number does not include security personnel whom the @entity1 government says died in attacks by " armed groups
" the @entity88 has imposed new sanctions on @entity15 and other senior @entity1 officials over human rights abuses , freezing any assets held in the country
@entity0 's @entity94 and @entity95 contributed to this report
