@entity0 -- it 's an ominous number
there could be up to 10,000 new @entity6 cases per week in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 by the end of this year as the outbreak spreads , the @entity3 warned tuesday
and now that a nurse has become the first person to contract @entity6 on @entity16 soil , the @entity12 says it has a new plan to help hospitals handle the deadly virus
" for any hospital anywhere in the country that has a confirmed case of @entity6 , we will put a team on the ground within hours , " @entity12 director dr. @entity20 told reporters
the response team will include experts in infection control , protective equipment and experimental therapies
a team such as that , @entity20 said , might have prevented a @entity37 nurse from contracting the disease
the nurse was a member of the medical team that treated an @entity6 patient who died last week
" i wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the first patient was diagnosed
that might have prevented this infection , " @entity20 said
" but we will do that from this day onward with any case anywhere in the @entity16 " in addition to the many experts it sent to @entity37 , @entity20 said , the @entity12 " could have sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more hands - on with the hospital from day one about exactly how this should be managed
it 's scary , " said @entity20
" and getting it right is really , really important , because the stakes are so high
" speaking to reporters in @entity62 , @entity3 assistant director - general dr. @entity63 told reporters that the @entity6 outbreak could get worse before it gets better
by december , he said , there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases weekly in @entity70
compare those december projections to the latest figures
as of tuesday morning , there were a total of 8,914 @entity6 cases and 4,447 deaths reported to the @entity3 , @entity63 said
the outbreak 's mortality rate , he said , is about 70 %
" this has been a deadly disease ever since we discovered it in 1976 , " said dr. @entity79 , a staff writer at the @entity80 and a former @entity12 disease detective
" certainly the death rate can be lowered if we do n't have any delays in diagnosis and do n't have any delays in treating people , " @entity79 told @entity1 's @entity85
@entity63 told reporters that in 90 days , officials have a goal they 're aiming for : they want to see the number of cases dropping from week to week
to start to decrease the rate of infection , the @entity3 says it hopes to isolate 70 % of @entity6 patients and have 70 % of @entity6 victim burials performed safely by december 1
getting responders , facilities and plans in place to meet the goal will be very difficult , @entity63 said
missing the goal will mean that more people will die than should have and that even more resources will be needed because the infection rate will continue to climb , he said
@entity37 nurse speaks days after authorities announced that a @entity37 nurse had contracted ebola , concerns in the @entity16 have focused on a key question : are people who are putting themselves in harm 's way to care for @entity6 victims receiving the training and equipment they need ? " i 've been hearing loud and clear from health care workers from around the country that they 're worried , that they do n't feel prepared to take care of a patient with @entity6 , " @entity20 said
every hospital in the @entity16 needs to be prepared to handle @entity6 , he said , adding that the @entity12 will be stepping up training efforts
the @entity37 nurse , @entity128 , had cared for @entity8 national @entity129 , who contracted @entity6 in @entity8 and died of the illness at @entity131
" a single infection in a health care worker is unacceptable , " @entity20 said
" and what we 're doing at this point is looking at everything we can do to minimize that risk so those that are caring for her do that safely and effectively
" at least 76 health care workers who may have come into contact with @entity129 after he was hospitalized are now being monitored for symptoms of the disease , @entity20 said
at the @entity37 hospital , teams from the @entity12 are taking a number of steps to improve safety in handling @entity6 , @entity20 said , including ensuring there 's a site manager making sure protective equipment is put on and taken off correctly
" there was n't a single individual accountable for that , " he said
" that 's a critical role and that 's there now
" they 're also improving training at the hospital and limiting the number of staff who go into the isolation area , he said
in a statement tuesday , @entity167 thanked supporters for sending kind wishes and prayers , according to the @entity37 hospital where she is being treated
" i am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world , " she said
infected nurse 's assistant ' helping ' as doctors treat her health authorities in @entity185 said a nurse 's assistant who is the first person to contract @entity6 in @entity187 in the current outbreak is still in serious condition but doing better
and even as @entity190 lies in a hospital bed , she 's doing everything she can to take care of doctors , nurses and herself , said dr. @entity196 , who is @entity197 's doctor and friend
" she is helping us to treat her
... she was where i am now , so she knows what i have to do , " @entity196 said
@entity197 's case , like @entity167 's , has raised serious questions about how equipped hospitals are to cope with the @entity6 outbreak
the @entity208 said monday that the @entity0 hospital treating @entity197 does n't meet all the standards set for centers capable of @entity6 care
and in a scathing letter , @entity213 , @entity197 's husband , said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of @entity0 's regional health minister over how the case has been handled
@entity197 helped care for one of two @entity185 missionaries who were brought back to @entity0 for treatment after being infected with the virus in @entity70
both men died of the illness
besides treating @entity197 , @entity185 authorities are monitoring 81 potential @entity6 cases -- 15 in hospitals and 66 at home , according to the @entity185 @entity230
none of them is showing symptoms of @entity6 , the ministry said
@entity197 is stable but remains in serious condition , @entity235 , director of the @entity236 in @entity0 , said at a news conference
a spokesman for a special committee created in @entity185 to keep people informed about @entity6 said @entity185 will have a contagious diseases reference center in each of its regions
police , firefighters and ambulance personnel , as well as hospital staff , will be trained to deal with @entity6 cases
@entity235 insisted that @entity185 's health care professionals have the situation under control
but he said more training will be given to health care workers and new guidelines will be prepared
" @entity6 is not a problem of @entity185
it is not a problem of the @entity16 , " he said
" it 's a global problem
" @entity1 's @entity258 reported from @entity0 , while @entity259 wrote and reported from @entity260 and @entity261 wrote and reported from @entity262
@entity1 's @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 contributed to this report .
