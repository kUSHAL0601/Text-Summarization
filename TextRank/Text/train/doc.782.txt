-- @entity3 fishermen suspended their blockade at three @entity6 ports thursday , allowing ferry traffic and freight to move through after two days of disruption , union leaders said
@entity3 fishing boats blockade the port of @entity12
the @entity3 ports of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity12 were open again after @entity3 unions met thursday and agreed to stop the blockade
union leaders have yet to agree on how the rest of their protest will develop , and whether the suspension will become permanent
the fishermen began their blockade of the three ports tuesday to protest @entity26 fishing quotas , which they say threaten their livelihoods
the flotillas forced a halt to all @entity31 traffic , including passenger ferries and freighters , stranding tourists on both sides of the waterway and causing a backlog of freight trucks
@entity39 , the largest ferry operator on the @entity6 , said it had resumed running normal services to @entity14
" it is our hope that we 'll be able to continue doing that throughout the day , " spokeswoman @entity42 said
@entity47 , which operates services to @entity12 , said it had canceled four sailings thursday as a result of the dispute
" we do not yet have any information on whether any of our services will be affected beyond 16th april , " the company said in a statement
@entity3 fishermen held four hours of talks with @entity58 and fisheries minister @entity59 in @entity60 on wednesday , the @entity3 news agency @entity56 reported
@entity59 offered the local industry â‚¬ 4 million ( $ 5.3 million ) in aid , but refused to budge on the fishermen 's key demand that the @entity26 increase fishing quotas , @entity56 reported
both @entity3 and the @entity26 have ruled out any renegotiation , pointing out that @entity3 cod quotas have already been raised 30 percent since 2008 , @entity56 said .
