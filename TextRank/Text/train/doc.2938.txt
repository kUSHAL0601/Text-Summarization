-- @entity1 has extended his contract at @entity4 champions @entity3 by 12 months until june 2012 , killing off speculation that he could be on his way to @entity7
coach @entity1 has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to @entity3
former @entity10 supremo @entity1 took charge at @entity12 giants @entity3 a year ago following the departure of @entity14 and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto
they also won the @entity18 , but were eliminated by defending champions @entity19 in the first knockout round of the @entity21
a statement on the @entity3 web site read : " in response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago , a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit , @entity3 announces the extension of @entity1 's contract until 30 june 2012
" @entity1 had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first @entity12 title , but the eal issue refused to go away until monday 's statement
when asked about the chance he could leave @entity3 , @entity1 had earlier told the club web site : " there is still a 0.01 % ( chance )
but for me this is not an important number , it just means that i am closer to @entity3 than to @entity7
" i am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players
i repeat , i am closer to staying at @entity3 than going elsewhere
" those comments failed to impress @entity3 president @entity52 , but the extended contract has settled any differences
@entity1 made his mark at @entity56 in 2004 when he led the @entity58 team to the @entity21 title , beating @entity60 3 - 0 in the final , before moving to @entity10
at @entity62 he claimed the @entity64 title in each of his first two seasons and the @entity66 the following campaign , but left the club in september 2007
not all @entity3 fans have warmed to the @entity58 since his arrival in @entity3 last summer
he has been involved in several disagreements with the @entity12 media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the @entity3 faithful .
