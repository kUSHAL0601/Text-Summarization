@entity0 -- a deeply divided @entity2 ruled wednesday that criminal defendants who receive inadequate legal advice on pretrial plea bargains can have their sentences overturned , equating that with an unconstitutional and ineffective assistance of counsel
the separate 5 - 4 decisions in a pair of cases from @entity11 and @entity12 will have a huge , immediate impact on the 97 % of federal convictions and 94 % of state convictions that stem from guilty pleas
" this court now holds that , as a general rule , defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused , " said justice @entity17 , joining four of his more liberal colleagues
" when the defense counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it , defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the @entity34 requires
" in a rare oral dissent delivered from the bench , justice @entity35 called the majority decision " absurd " and " unheard - of
" in unusual detail , the opinion lays out specific guidelines to defense counsel , saying they must relay plea bargain offers from the prosecution , regardless whether the lawyer believes them to be proper
the case from @entity11 involved @entity49 , convicted of assault with intent to murder and other charges , after shooting and seriously wounding a woman
the state twice offered to dismiss two of the charges , and recommended a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea
@entity49 claims he rejected the offers after his lawyer convinced him the prosecution could not prove the most serious charge
the defendant was convicted and received 185 to 360 months behind bars
in @entity12 , @entity67 was charged with driving on a revoked license
three previous convictions on the same charge meant he could be sentenced to up to four years in prison
court records shows he was not told about two pretrial plea bargain offers that would have reduced his jail time
a week before his preliminary court hearing , the man was again arrested on the same offense
with no deal on the table , he subsequently pleaded guilty and received three years imprisonment
" there appears to be a reasonable probability @entity83 would have accepted the prosecutor 's original offer of a plea bargain if the offer had been communicated to him , " @entity17 said in his ruling , " because he pleaded guilty ( later ) to a more serious charge , with no promise of a sentencing recommendation from the prosecution
" justices @entity93 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 supported @entity17 , who again proved to be the " swing " vote for the majority
both cases were sent back to lower courts to sort out the new sentencing guidelines
in his dissent , @entity35 warned criminal defendants will now flood courts with new claims of bad legal representation
" the court today embraces the sporting chance theory of criminal law , in which the state functions like a conscientious casino operator , giving each player a fair chance to beat the house , that is , serve less time than the law says he deserves , " he said
" and when a player is excluded from the tables , his constitutional rights have been violated
" he added , " in today 's cases , the court 's zeal to bring perfection to everything requires the reversal of perfectly valid , eminently just convictions , " @entity35 said
" it is not wise ; it is not right
" chief justice @entity131 and justices @entity132 and @entity134 joined all or part of the dissent
the cases are @entity49 v. @entity138 ( 10 - 209 ) and @entity12 v. @entity83 ( 10 - 444 ) .
