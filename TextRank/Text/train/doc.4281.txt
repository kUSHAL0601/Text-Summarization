the @entity1 @entity0 voted wednesday to expel former prime minister @entity2 from parliament after his conviction for tax fraud
the vote was 192 to 113 , with two abstentions
analysts had predicted his ouster , with both the center - left @entity11 and anti-establishment @entity13 promising to vote against the 77 - year - old billionaire media tycoon
the vote follows @entity2 's conviction on charges related to a vast tax fraud conspiracy at his @entity20 television empire
@entity2 was convicted of tax evasion last october , sentenced to four years in prison and barred from public office for two years
the prison time was later reduced to one year of community service
the former pm had called on his supporters to protest in @entity28 ahead of the vote
he even asked senators to delay the ballot , claiming to have new evidence proving he did not commit tax fraud
@entity2 , who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011 , has dominated the lively @entity1 political scene for the past two decades
despite his expulsion from parliament , he is unlikely to disappear
" he is not out of politics , he is out of government , " @entity39 , chairman of the @entity40 at the @entity41 , told @entity42
" he will cease being sen. @entity45
" the former prime minister could face other headaches
the expulsion from parliament means losing a partial immunity senators hold from prosecution , and he could face charges in other cases
for years , he has also been entangled in fraud , corruption and sex scandals that have often reached the @entity1 courts
at a news conference tuesday , @entity2 's lawyers dismissed as " an absolutely unreal possibility " that he could face further criminal charges for other cases
@entity2 was convicted of tax fraud in october last year over deals involving @entity20 , and the verdict was upheld in august
