-- wildlife researchers in @entity2 have photographed one of the world 's most reclusive primates for the first time
sightings of the @entity9 slender loris -- a small nocturnal primate with extremely thin arms and legs and huge round eyes -- are so rare that the creature has only been seen four times since 1937
conservationists feared the species had become extinct during a 63 - year gap between sightings from 1939 to 2002
populations of all types of slender loris , which are native to the rainforests of @entity2 and southern @entity24 , have been in decline in recent years because of destruction of their forest habitat by logging , agriculture and development
that prompted an 18 - month study of the creatures led by researchers working for the @entity35 's edge project -- a conservation initiative dedicated to raising awareness about the plight of animals on the brink of extinction
researchers from the @entity43 and the @entity44 also took part
research leader @entity46 said more than 1,000 nocturnal studies in 120 different forest areas had been conducted as part of the study
" this discovery is a great reward for the ongoing field research we undertake across much of south - western @entity2 , " @entity46 said
@entity35 conservation biologist dr. @entity55 said the study was the first close examination of a @entity9 slender loris ever conducted
the pictures show a 20 - centimeter long male adult sitting on a forest branch forest
conservationists have discovered it appears to have shorter and sturdier limbs than other loris ; a possible adaptation for the cooler , high - altitude montane -- or cloud -- forest in which it lives
that could mean the @entity9 slender loris is a distinct species in its own right , said @entity46
results of the study are published in the latest edition of the journal @entity79
" we are thrilled to have captured the first ever photographs and prove its continued existence -- especially after its 65 year disappearing act , " said @entity55
" the discovery improves our knowledge of this species , but we need to focus our efforts on the conservation and restoration of the remaining montane forest where this species still exists
currently this accounts for less than one percent of the land area of @entity2
