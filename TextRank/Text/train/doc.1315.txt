-- asked about part of the entertainment business he particularly enjoys , @entity1 -- stand - up comedian , author , tv writer and producer -- had an unusual answer
@entity1 co-wrote " @entity8 , " based on a popular episode of " @entity10
" " my instrumental punk and ska band called the @entity14 , " he said with a laugh
" there 's seven guys in the band
... we play shows around @entity20
" but the co-author of " @entity8 , " now a film starring @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , admits that stand - up comedy remains a longtime passion
in fact , it led -- in a roundabout way -- to " @entity8
" " i was a stand - up who had an @entity34 special called ' @entity35 , ' and it was directed by @entity36 , who became an executive producer of ' @entity10 , ' " @entity1 said
one thing led to another , and @entity1 soon joined a mostly female writing team on " @entity10
" he observed that he was the only straight male writer for the show and offered the group valuable and realistic insight into the world of men
" sure , i felt a little bit like a token , " he said
" it 's not like those women needed my help , but i think there are days when you ca n't write in a perspective you do n't live
" that perspective , along with colleague @entity55 's female point of view , gave way to " @entity8
" the book is based on a popular episode of " @entity10 , " in which @entity61 's boyfriend ( played by @entity62 ) offers the line to @entity64 as she puzzles over a date
the book is a wake - up call for women who obsess and worry about relationships , with an overarching message that if women find themselves doing the chasing , it 's likely the guy simply is n't interested
" we were raised to pursue women
... most of the guys i know enjoy the pursuit , " he said
" but that does n't mean women should be wallflowers
" as a comedian - turned - relationship expert -- one who is , by the way , now happily married and writing a book with his wife -- @entity1 said he hoped women would realize their worth when they read the book or watch the film
" [ women ] deserve great things , and they get to decide what their relationships are , and not other people , " he said
" you often hear women say , ' i do n't know if he 's ready to get married
' why are you waiting for his decision ? we always put our fates in other people 's hands
