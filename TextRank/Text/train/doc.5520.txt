-- @entity1 on friday urged @entity3 authorities not to paralyze a man as punishment for his having paralyzed someone else , allegedly during a fight
the @entity3 newspaper @entity8 reported that the judge in the case had sent letters to several hospitals in @entity3 asking if they could sever a man 's spinal cord , as the man he allegedly stabbed had requested and , under sharia law , was his right to seek
but such a punishment would amount " to nothing less than torture , " said @entity21 , acting director of the organization 's @entity22 and @entity24
" while those guilty of a crime should be held accountable , intentionally paralyzing a man in this way would constitute torture , and be a breach of its international human rights obligations
" the paralyzed man , 22 - year - old @entity32 , told @entity8 that the accused stabbed him in the back with a large knife during a fight more than two years ago
" the accused confessed to the crime in front of police , resulting in a general sentence of seven months , " he told the newspaper
during that time , the court in the northwest province of @entity46 debated how to carry out the surgery the paralyzed man was seeking as punishment for his alleged attacker , news reports said
@entity52 's @entity51 , one of the kingdom 's leading hospitals , responded that , from a medical perspective , it would not be possible for them to cause the injury by performing such surgery , @entity8 reported
but apparently at least one hospital said it would be possible
" according to one report , one hospital said it would be possible to medically administer the injury at the same place on the spinal cord as the damage the man is alleged to have caused his victim using a cleaver , during a fight more than two years ago , causing similar paralysis , " @entity1 said in a news release
it is up to the court to decide whether to impose the paralysis punishment or sentence the man to imprisonment , financial compensation , or flogging , it said
the alleged attacker , who has not been identified publicly , " was convicted and sentenced following a trial where he was said to have had no legal assistance , " @entity1 added
international human rights law would consider such a sentence to be a violation of the prohibition of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to break the @entity88 to which @entity3 is a party , @entity1 said
it would also violate the principles of medical ethics adopted by the @entity92 , it said
other sentences of retribution in the kingdom have included eye - gouging , tooth extraction , and death in cases involving murder , it said
international organizations are not the only ones to protest
outrage has been expressed by bloggers in @entity3 over the sentence , which underscores the societal struggle in @entity3 between hardliners , who hew to tribal justice , and progressives , who consider such verdicts to be draconian and bad for the country 's international image
the fact that newspapers and bloggers are questioning decisions by courts -- institutions traditionally considered above reproach -- is a relatively recent phenomenon in @entity3 , where other such sentences have captured international attention
" this case in @entity3 is not the only case of its kind , " said @entity122 , a former commissioner of justice in @entity124 who is chairman of the department of @entity126 at @entity127 in @entity128
" we see many cases like this -- stoning or beheading or cutting off hands or feet in @entity136 , @entity137 and parts of @entity124 , which are very tribal
" under @entity141 law , compassion is an important virtue for any judge , @entity122 said
" however harsh the punishment would be in tribal law , an @entity145 , the compassion element that must be exercised by the judge overrides it , and i 'm afraid we do n't see much of that in cases like this where , very often , the victim becomes twice punished , " he added
@entity0 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this story .
