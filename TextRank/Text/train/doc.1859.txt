two more infants have contracted the herpes virus after undergoing an @entity4 @entity3 type of circumcision , which has been linked to the spread of the potentially deadly virus to newborn boys , according to the @entity9
in the ritual , known as metzitzah b'peh , after removing the foreskin of the penis the person performing the procedure places his mouth briefly over the wound , sucking a small amount of blood out , which is discarded
antibacterial ointment is applied and the wound is bandaged
the health department says the procedure is dangerous because the contact with the mouth could transmit diseases such as herpes
most adults are infected with the herpes simplex virus type 1 , and while they may have no symptoms , the virus may be present in their saliva , according to the health department
( it is different from herpes simplex virus type 2 , which is usually transmitted sexually
) " while @entity35 - 1 in adults can cause the common cold sore , @entity38 - 1 infection in newborns is very serious , " a department statement says
since 2000 , there have been 13 reports in @entity42 of infants contracting @entity35 , two of whom died from the virus
the health department reported that an estimated 20,493 infants in @entity42 were exposed to the practice in that period
in the most recent case , the infant developed a fever seven days after circumcision and vesicular lesions the following day , according to a press release from the city health department
seventy percent of neonatal herpes cases show lesions and only 40 % produce a fever
the @entity61 passed a regulation in september requiring all those who perform the ritual to get parental consent on a form stating that the procedure can lead to health risks
several @entity3 groups and three rabbis filed a lawsuit in federal @entity72 in @entity73 arguing that " the government can not compel the transmission of messages that the speaker does not want to express -- especially when the speaker is operating in an area of heightened @entity81 protection , such as a religious ritual
" dr. @entity83 , commissioner of the city 's health department , claimed the consent requirement was " lawful , appropriate and necessary " in a september press release
" the city 's highest obligation is to protect its children ; therefore , it is important that parents know the risks associated with the practice , " he said
baby boys whose circumcisions likely involved the ritual between april 2006 and december 2011 had an estimated risk of contracting neonatal @entity35 infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases , 3.4 times greater than other infants , according to the health department
" there is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn , " @entity83 said
while @entity3 regularly practice circumcision as part of their religion , metzitzah b'peh is limited to a relatively small number of @entity4 .
