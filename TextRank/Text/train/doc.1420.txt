@entity0 -- the nation 's second largest city is preparing for potential traffic paralysis with the closure this weekend of a major highway that passes through the mountains of @entity0
last year 's closure of @entity9 -- described by local officials as " the nation 's busiest freeway " -- was expected to be so apocalyptic that car - loving @entity0 labeled the weekend shutdown " @entity14
" in fact , traffic flowed rather smoothly because many motorists stayed home , and the freeway through the @entity20 reopened ahead of schedule on that july 2011 weekend
this year 's construction effort is dubbed " @entity14 , " and officials are concerned again about ultra-gridlock out of a fear that motorists may take to the roads this weekend out of excessive confidence and complacency
motorists should avoid driving this weekend in affected areas , local officials said
" we do n't want people to become complacent based on the success of last year 's closure
once again , it 's vitally important that we all plan ahead , avoid the area , and eat , shop and play locally
otherwise , there will be problems , " said @entity37 , the @entity39 's director for @entity0 and @entity41 counties
@entity44 , @entity45 's executive director of transit project delivery , said : " the risk factors that caused transportation , law enforcement and emergency response agencies heartburn during last year 's i - 405 freeway closure have not changed
" @entity52 is still the nation 's busiest freeway , " he said
" the closure is still in the geographically constrained @entity20 , where there are no immediate or effective alternate routes
that 's why we still need the public 's full and complete cooperation if this second closure operation is going to be as successful as the first
" a 10 - mile section of @entity9 is scheduled to be closed from as early as 10 p.m. friday ( 1 a.m. et saturday ) until 5 a.m. ( 8 a.m. et ) monday
the 405 , as it 's locally called , cuts through the @entity65 and connects suburban @entity66 with @entity67 and the well - to - do neighborhoods of west @entity0 , such as @entity69 and @entity70
specifically , the 405 will be closed between @entity72 and @entity73 101
the highway construction project this weekend will complete a carpool lane system over the mountain pass to create a continuous carpool lane of almost 73 miles in each direction between @entity80 and @entity81 's @entity66 -- the longest in the world , officials said
highway reconstruction will continue until 2013 , when the overall $ 1.34 billion project is scheduled for completion , officials said
improvements include new bridges and ramps and building 18 miles of retaining and sound walls , officials said .
