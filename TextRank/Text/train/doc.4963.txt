-- @entity1 wants us to all to know that he loves " all people " and hates " no one
" in fact , he 's not guilty of hate speech at all , the " @entity8 " star said in an appearance on the " today " show this morning
the devout @entity10 and father of six stopped by to talk about his new movie " @entity13 " and try to put out the fire started by his recent controversial comments about homosexuality
" when you take a subject and reduce it to a four - second sound bite and a checkmark on a ballot , i think that 's inappropriate and insensitive , " he said of how he unintentionally ignited the controversy
in fact , @entity1 stands by his comments and insists he 's not a bully
" i was surprised , frankly , that people were surprised by the things that i 've said , " @entity1 told host @entity28
" i have been consistent for 15 years as a @entity10
i 'm a @entity31 - believing @entity10
what i would have thought was more newsworthy is if i had said something that contradicted the word of @entity35 , if i had contradicted my faith
" when asked if his comments might encourage people to terrorize homosexuals , he responded , " nobody should mistreat anybody
we all have our convictions formed by different things and mine are informed by my faith
they 're formed by the word of @entity35 , and i found that to be an anchor for me , a compass , and a guide for me
when people start bullying one another and calling each other names for those different convictions , then i think you get into problems
