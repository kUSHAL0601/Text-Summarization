@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 - born man accused of posting an online attack against the creators of the animated tv series " @entity8 " due to a depiction of the @entity10 agreed to plead guilty wednesday to providing material support to terrorists and other charges
under the agreement announced in federal court , @entity14 , 20 , also pleaded guilty to charges of communicating threats and soliciting crimes of violence
the three charges carry a total maximum prison sentence of 30 years , and @entity4 district judge @entity23 told wednesday 's court hearing that @entity14 's defense agreed to a sentence of at least 20 years for acts " intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism
" @entity23 accepted the plea agreement and declared @entity14 guilty as charged , setting the sentencing for february 25 , 2011
@entity14 , dressed in a green prison jumpsuit with the word " prisoner " stenciled on the back , answered questions from the judge but made no statement
his once - long hair had been cut short
@entity40 , @entity14 's federal public defender , said the case was different from other recent terrorism cases
" mr. @entity14 has renounced violent jihad , " @entity40 said
" he has accepted responsibility and is deeply remorseful
he is a young man who has taken the first steps towards putting his life back together
you saw one of those first steps today
" as part of the plea agreement , federal authorities agreed not to seek charges of aiding and abetting against @entity14 's wife - @entity54
she already is charged with making a false statement , which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison upon conviction
the couple has an infant son
during the half - hour hearing , @entity14 's defense said federal prosecutors agreed not to request that @entity14 serve his time in the federal " supermax " prison in @entity67
@entity14 , a convert to @entity68 , is accused of posting an online attack against the creators of the animated tv series " @entity8 , " as well as information on explosives meant to be used to kill civilians
prosecutors also say @entity14 , of @entity76 , @entity1 , had exchanged e-mails with @entity79 - @entity4 cleric @entity78 , whose name has been linked to an attack and an attempted attack on the @entity4
@entity14 was questioned in 2009 about his internet postings and e-mail communications with @entity78
@entity4 officials revealed that they had been staging court - ordered electronic surveillance of @entity14
in april , @entity14 , who also goes by the name @entity89 , authored a post on a radical @entity68 website that included a warning to the creators of " @entity8 " after an episode of the cartoon series depicted the @entity10 in a bear suit
the posting on @entity98 says : " we have to warn @entity100 [ @entity101 ] and @entity102 [ @entity103 ] that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like @entity107 for airing this show
this is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them
" @entity107 , a @entity115 filmmaker , was murdered by an @entity68 extremist in 2004 after making a short documentary on violence against women in some @entity68 societies
the internet posting features a graphic photograph of @entity107 with his throat cut and a dagger in his chest
the entry goes on to advise readers : " you can contact them [ the makers of " @entity8 " ] , or pay @entity131 or their own company a visit at these addresses ... " and lists @entity131 's @entity136 address and the @entity137 , @entity138 , address of @entity103 and @entity101 's production company
@entity14 told @entity2 at the time that providing the addresses was not intended as a threat but to give people the opportunity to protest
an affidavit from prosecutors details other videos and postings from @entity14 , including a link to an army ranger handbook with information on explosive devices and a post about " desensitizing " police by leaving fake suspicious bags around in public places
an @entity160 agent who spoke with @entity14 on july 14 said that " @entity14 stated that he was an influential person in the @entity163 community , and could be considered one of the top individuals in this area
" @entity14 tried to fly to @entity167 on july 10 and then on to @entity168
according to an affidavit , he tried to take his infant son with him , telling his wife it was part of his " cover " to make it less likely anyone would suspect he was trying to go to @entity168 to join the militant group @entity176
the court documents said @entity14 was not allowed to depart the country july 10 but was told by the airline he was on the " no - fly list " and was questioned by a @entity182 agent
he was not arrested , and according to the documents , he contacted an @entity160 agent and said he wanted to provide information about @entity176
in subsequent interviews with the @entity160 , @entity14 allegedly said he had been in contact with @entity176 , felt that he would have no problem joining the group when he reached @entity168 and knew it had been designated as a terrorist group by the @entity4 government
court documents say @entity14 thought that after training , he would be placed in the group 's media branch but that people in that position still engage in fighting
@entity14 was arrested on july 21
a search of @entity14 's home uncovered a handwritten note called " how to destroy the @entity202 " that contained a bulleted list of activities
" under the attacks on personnel , " the affidavit said , @entity14 wrote " put out a message to the @entity207 to go buy guns and kill soldiers " and " fill a tanker with explosives and @entity212 , " a toxic protein extracted from castor beans
@entity2 's @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this story .
