@entity1 authorities accused four top military officials of connections with organized crime in a high - profile case that has renewed debate over the role of government troops in the drug war
a former deputy defense secretary was among the officials in a maximum - security prison in central @entity1 wednesday , a day after prosecutors accused them of having cartel ties
one of @entity1 's most notorious accused drug lords , @entity16 , was also indicted in the case tuesday , but authorities did not specify the connection between him and the military officials
authorites have described the @entity21 - born @entity20 , known as " @entity16 " because of his blue eyes and fair complexion , as one of the most ruthless drug traffickers in @entity1
a judge charged him with homicide tuesday , but authorities did not provide details about the allegations against him
@entity20 is also accused in the @entity21 of attempting to launder money and conspiring to import and distribute cocaine
more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug - related violence in @entity1 since december 2006 , when president @entity35 announced a crackdown on cartels
in the halls of @entity1 's @entity41 , this week 's indictment of the military officials rekindled discussion over a hallmark of @entity35 's strategy : deploying thousands of troops into the streets to patrol hot spots where warring cartels are battling over turf
" while the army is in the streets , when there are these kinds of topics that are very sensitive coming up , it seems to me that we must look at this process with all the transparency in the world so that there are n't any doubts about the fair trial that everyone deserves , including the generals , " sen. @entity50 of the conservative @entity51 told @entity1 's state - run @entity53 news agency
@entity69 of the leftist @entity70 told @entity53 that the case was an unfortunate sign that organized crime had infiltrated the military 's ranks
" we have to find a way to protect the @entity77 because it is one of our most prestigious institutions , " she said
gen. @entity81 , retired lt. col. @entity82 and retired gen. @entity83 and @entity84 -- a retired general and former deputy defense secretary -- were charged tuesday
the military officials were arrested in may , but tuesday 's indictment marked the first time formal charges were brought against them
@entity91 ' attorney , @entity90 , told @entity92 that the former defense official had been expecting the charges and welcomed the opportunity to defend his innocence in a trial
in may , after the officials were detained , all three major political parties in @entity1 called for a full investigation into reports that he and other officers were being bribed to protect the now defunct @entity104 cartel
lawmakers have lamented what could be one of the highest - level corruption cases in @entity1 's recent history
" if proven , the full weight of the law must be applied because they have been federal government officials and are responsible for combating organized crime , and if they are colluding with them the punishment should set an example , " legislator @entity110 told state - run media .
