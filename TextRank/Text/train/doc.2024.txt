-- @entity1 : an adjective meaning " leaf - bearing " or , alternately , " the word that exiled me to the oft - fabled @entity6 at the 1986 @entity7 in @entity8 " strangely , i did n't mind ; i 'd already gotten my prize
very few of us are lovely on the outside at age 13 , and even less so are those of us inclined toward worrying words down to their etymological nubbins
my light - socket perm , train track braces and penchant for unicorn sweatshirts were n't doing me any favors when it came to feeling at ease among my peers back home
yes , i 'd gotten attention from the local press , glossy plaques , a pep rally at my @entity28 , @entity29 , school and , creepily enough , an obscene phone call -- all accolades for my ascent through regional bee wins
however , i 'd have gladly traded every scrap of that for a chance to feel like one of the girls who knew how to give herself @entity40 - in highlights and flirt adorably with the boys on the basketball team
that was until i met @entity44
upon arrival at the @entity48 hotel , spellers were issued a blue , plastic - bound autograph book as impetus to mingle with our fellow contenders
after some initial hesitation , i actually began to enjoy the ritual of handing over the little talisman , scribbling something silly in the the book they 'd handed me in return , then trading back and madly flipping through to see what they 'd written to me
i liked @entity44 right away
she was " bee royalty " -- a brash , third - time competitor from @entity65 , @entity66 , prone to yelling things like " nuke the @entity68 ! " and quoting @entity71 comedy shows
as she doodled an elaborate self - portrait that filled a whole page in the back of the book , she gave me the lay of the land
that kid over there -- rumor had it his family had hired a professional coach to prep him
that girl -- home - schooled
do n't look for her at any of the mixers or day trips
her mom was going to keep her locked in the hotel room , cramming until the very last second
@entity91 kicked off wednesday @entity44 , herself , was n't going to be skimping on socializing and sightseeing , but she was going to sequester herself for some last - minute studying in the hopes of making one last run at the title in her final year of eligibility
and oddly -- very oddly -- for me , a kid prone to gut - grinding panic attacks , self - flagellation over academic success and generally ill at ease in my own skin , i began to sink into calm
i was n't , for once , the dorkiest girl in the room , and instead was surrounded by kids who lived for language play , lovely books , good grades and a life of the mind
i 'd suddenly found my people
and while there was n't a gawky little ghost of a chance that i was going to beat them in the bee this year , i was cool with that
my cool lasted until we hit the ballroom stage the next day and a few hundred terrified , raw - nerved elementary school kids with pasteboard number signs around our necks had to stand in front of cameras from every major national news organization and spell words that i could have sworn the announcers were making up on the spot : gobemouche , phaeochrous , exiguous
many kids hemmed , hawed , begged , borrowed and stole time with requests for definitions , etymologies , sentence use
i just went for it
machine ( duh ! )
@entity141 ( a word i shoehorn into conversation as frequently as possible )
i think there 's another round i 'm still blocking out
and then : " @entity1
" " could you repeat that ? " " @entity1
" " uh ... @entity148
my head , now freed of its duties for the day , floated somewhere off into the middle distance , and i trudged off to the @entity6 where some well - meaning volunteers offered tissues , cookies and hugs to spellers whose dreams had been shattered
i opted for the cookie and went off to apologize to my dad , who 'd spent a goodly amount of his evenings on my training
that 's ok , he assured me
he was just excited that we 'd get to go to more museums
did i want to hit the @entity168 now ? i 'd wanted to go to that museum for ages , but instead , i took my place in the audience and watched my friend @entity44 battle through several more rounds before butting up against , i believe the word was , " dentifrice
" she joined me in the ballroom , kibitzing at my side as speller 102 , @entity181 of @entity182 , @entity183 , took home top honors for " odontalgia " - a fancy word for toothache
@entity44 grumbled that she totally could have gotten that one
@entity181 went on tv to visit @entity192 and spell against @entity193 , where i 'm happy to say , one of @entity197 's bandmates spelled " phyllophorous " incorrectly
@entity181 got cash prizes and a place in the history books
i got a weird , funny friend who kind of understood me
and that was o - k - a - y with me .
