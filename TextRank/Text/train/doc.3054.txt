in the @entity3 age -- when digital " friends " are just a click away -- the distance between people seems to be shrinking , according to data the social network released on monday night
the adage maintains there are " six degrees of separation " between any two people on @entity12 , meaning that any two people would know each other through no more than six intermediary contacts
on @entity3 , however , the average user is only 4.74 degrees away from any other facebooker
" thus , when considering even the most distant @entity3 user in the @entity25 tundra or the @entity27 rainforest , a friend of your friend probably knows a friend of their friend , " @entity3 wrote in a blog post about its findings
that conclusion comes from a non-peer - reviewed study of 721 million active @entity3 users , released by @entity3 in collaboration with the @entity35 , the blog post says
@entity3 calls the analysis " the largest social network studies ever released
" the @entity38 , @entity39 , company says 99.6 % of all @entity3 users studied were separated by five degrees or less from any other @entity3 user ; 92 % were separated by only four degrees
furthermore , that distance appears to be shrinking quickly
" the average distance in 2008 was 5.28 hops , while now it is 4.74 , " @entity3 says
while online @entity3 friends are more likely to be linked to far - flung friends - of - friends , their immediate circles of contacts are remarkably homogenous in terms of age and geography
" we observed that while the entire world is only a few degrees away , a user 's friends are most likely to be of a similar age and come from the same country , " the company writes
within the @entity63 , for instance , users on average are linked by three intermediary contacts
@entity3 compares its work to that of 1960s social psychologist @entity68 's experiments to prove that people are separated by only six contacts
the company explains @entity68 's work like this : " the idea was first put to the test by @entity68 in the 1960 's
@entity68 selected 296 volunteers and asked them to dispatch a message to a specific individual , a stockholder living in the @entity79 suburb of @entity80 , @entity81
" the volunteers were told that they could n't send the message directly to the target person ( unless the sender knew them personally ) , but that they should route the message to a personal acquaintance that was more likely than the sender to know the target person
" @entity68 found that the average number of intermediate persons in these chains was 5.2 ( representing about 6 hops )
the experiment showed that not only are there few degrees of separation between any two people , but that individuals can successfully navigate these short paths , even though they have no way of seeing the entire network
" there seem to be some obvious and fundamental differences between their reports , however
not everyone knows all of their @entity3 contacts in real life , of course
and the nature of digital friendship -- and even an online friend network -- takes on a different , and potentially more global , character than face - to - face networks of friends and contacts
" we are close , in a sense , to people who do n't necessarily like us , sympathize with us or have anything in common with us , " @entity118 , from @entity119 , told the @entity120
" it 's the weak ties that make the world small
" @entity3 acknowledges some methodological differences , as well
" it is important to note that while @entity68 was motivated by the same question ( how many individuals separate any two people ) , these numbers are not directly comparable ; his subjects only had limited knowledge of the social network , while we have a nearly complete representation of the entire thing , " @entity3 writes on its data blog
" our measurements essentially describe the shortest possible routes that his subjects could have found
" thank you , computers
the findings do highlight the idea that the @entity148 is bringing people closer together -- something social media users can sense with or without this data
" ultimate proof that our world is getting smaller and smaller , " one @entity3 user wrote in a comment on the company 's post
another wrote : " awesome study ! as a @entity163 fan , i have been waiting years to see this analysis and it was worth the wait
beyond any commercial purpose , @entity3 data can help us understand how human society is organized , how ideas spread , and how we are connected to each other
" one last burning question : where does @entity174 fit into this ?
