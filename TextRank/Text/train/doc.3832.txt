@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's capital may not be causing shivers to @entity7 's famed @entity6 casino just yet , but @entity0 hopes to muscle in on @entity10 's appetite for gambling
the first phase of a controversial , multi-billion dollar casino and hotel complex that @entity1 are calling " @entity15 " is scheduled to open in 2017 in the @entity0 suburb of @entity17 , about eight miles southwest of the city center
a top executive from @entity20 -- founded and run by @entity22 billionaire political activist @entity21 -- unveiled the exact location of its large complex during a news conference on friday
the new resort could bring tens of thousands of new jobs to recession - gripped @entity1 as it lures travelers hungry for a taste of @entity31 in @entity10
opponents say the @entity31 - style resort would create only low - skilled and low - paying jobs -- not the development model needed to put @entity1 get back on its feet economically
they also have concerns that the resort would attract organized crime
at friday 's packed news conference , @entity20 chief operating officer @entity39 said he 's confident of securing financing for the first phase of the project , which would cost approximately $ 9 billion and include 12,000 hotel rooms
@entity20 is financing $ 3.6 billion , or 40 % , of the cost of the first phase , and @entity39 said he has " assurances from many banks " about financing the remaining 60 %
but an aide later said that no contracts have been signed yet
that may be because @entity20 must still formally compete to win the right to build the development through an open public bid process
that process opens in march , officials said , and results should be announced by september
if the company wins the bid , groundbreaking could begin by the end of this year
@entity39 said the first phase could easily generate some tens of thousands of jobs , based on the company 's experience at its similar , but smaller , gambling resort in @entity66
a company spokeswoman later said the entire $ 22 billion project , when completed over 20 years , could create 250,000 jobs
@entity20 ' ceo @entity21 has built the company into a leading global developer of gambling , entertainment and convention resorts
it owns the @entity76 and @entity78 gambling resorts in @entity31 , @entity79 , and has expanded into @entity81 markets , including resorts in @entity66 and @entity83
last september , @entity21 announced that he 'd chosen @entity0 , instead of @entity84 , as the site for the project in @entity1
that set off months of debate over which of three potential locations in the @entity0 area would get the nod , something that was finally resolved publicly on friday
@entity20 had previously said that the resort 's access to @entity0 's international airport was a priority
yet , the suburb of @entity17 and the airport are located on opposite sides of city center
@entity1 authorities are considering rail links between the airport and the resort , @entity0 regional government president @entity101 said friday , although such a plan would require input from @entity1 's national government
another detail being worked out is whether visitors to @entity0 's " @entity15 " resort will be able to light up , something that 's commonplace inside the large casinos on the @entity114
@entity1 has strict no - smoking laws in public places and the national government would have to grant a special waiver to allow smoking in the casino resort .
