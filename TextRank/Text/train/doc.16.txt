the trend - setting state of @entity5 is voting next month on a ballot initiative to legalize pot , also known as @entity8
the measure would legalize recreational use in the state , though federal officials have said they would continue to enforce drug laws in @entity5 if the initiative is approved
" what i think is horrible about all of this , is that we criminalize young people
and we use so many of our excellent resources ... for things that are n't really causing any problems , " said @entity1
" it 's not a toxic substance
" supporters of @entity5 's @entity27
19 say it would raise revenue and cut the cost of enforcement , while opponents point to drug 's harmful side - effects
@entity2 attorney general @entity35 said in a letter , obtained by @entity0 friday , that federal agents would continue to enforce federal marijuana laws and warned @entity27
19 , if passed , would be a major stumbling block to federal partnerships between state and local authorities around drug enforcement
his letter was a response to an august letter from several former directors of the @entity48 urging the @entity49 to block @entity27
19 if it 's approved next month
elders stressed the drug is not physically addictive and pointed to the damaging impact of alcohol , which is legal

" we can use our resources so much better
