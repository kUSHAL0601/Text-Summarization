-- @entity1 claimed a sixth victory in the @entity3 to @entity5 yacht race on thursday after producing a record time to see off the opposition
the super-maxi crossed the line with an official time of one day , 18 hours , 23 minutes and 12 seconds to claim victory in the prestigious 628 - nautical mile bluewater classic
it broke its own previous record of one day , 18 hours , 40 minutes and 10 seconds , which it set back in 2005
it also won the race every year from 2005 - 08 and in 2010 but last year was narrowly beaten by @entity16 , which finished a distant second this time under the new name of @entity16
" last year we were beaten by by three minutes , which was very disappointing
this year we beat them by much more , " skipper @entity21 told the race 's official website after coming home with 45 nautical miles to spare
the record had looked like slipping out of his grasp as conditions lightened going up the @entity30 , but @entity31 ordered a bigger mainsail to keep momentum going
" we just kept chipping away
you expect it to be light in the @entity30 and it did get lighter towards the end
this is a very testing event and the @entity39 is very , very , testing
it 's always a tough race , " he said
" we had some very hard and fast running conditions ; we blew out a spinnaker and had some gear failure , so it was n't all smooth sailing
" most of the crew have been together since 2005 , with @entity51 celebrating his 25th race with a record 10th line honors victory
official race website @entity1 became only the second boat in the event to break its own record
" we 'll try to do it again next year , " owner @entity58 said
" new wings on the keel helped enormously i 'm sure , so did the new jib
the design , the crew , the sails and the modifications are what makes the boat fast
" @entity16 , skippered by 85 - year - old @entity69 , was confirmed in second ahead of @entity71 after being cleared of making an early start on wednesday
an international jury ruled friday that race officials had failed to inform @entity75 that he had jumped the gun
@entity75 was left to rue problems with damaged headsail equipment on the first night of the race
" we had a bit of trouble , " he said after finishing his 44th @entity5 in one day , 23 hours and eight minutes and 44 seconds
" we 're new to the boat , we 've only had it two months
i think we did pretty well
the boys pushed the boat really hard , it 's just unfortunate that things broke or went wrong
" the race , being held for the 68th time , is known as one of the toughest in the world
the 1998 edition ended with just 44 of the 115 entries completing the journey , as five boats sank and six people died
living doll was the first yacht of the 76 - strong fleet to withdraw from this year 's event , suffering a broken rudder near the middle of @entity105 , 90 nautical miles north east of @entity106
" @entity107 has been advised that the crew are all in good shape and that they are managing by themselves
they have not asked any other yacht to stand by , " the @entity3 - @entity5 website reported thursday
it was followed by @entity114 ( damaged mainsail ) and @entity116 , which developed steering issues .
