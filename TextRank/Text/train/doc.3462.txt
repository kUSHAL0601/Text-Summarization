-- oh , figure skating
did n't anyone tell you ? the @entity4 is over
you are supposed to be reformed
at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , on thursday , @entity7 's @entity6 , a 2010 olympic gold medalist , skated an ethereally beautiful and outwardly perfect long program in the ladies free skating competition
she then lost gold to @entity10 's @entity15
on paper , @entity15 had one more triple jump than @entity6 , including the triple loop , which @entity6 does not do
although @entity15 had an awkward moment on her own double loop , her spins were faster , her jumps higher , and unlike @entity6 , who looked exhausted at the end of her gorgeous skate , @entity15 flew across the ice with great speed and then looked like she could do it all again
it should have been a great moment in @entity30 sports : champion dethroned by a rising star , an upset , a shocker
instead , it was controversial water cooler fodder the next day because the results raised so many questions : did the youngster , a bit rough around the edges , deserve such high marks ? was she really better in just about every element , including her components mark , which was an astonishing 4.81 points higher than at the @entity48 championships last month ? setting aside her extreme margin of victory , there are reasons to think the judges got the podium right
three - time world champion @entity57 , for example , who had always accentuated an aggressive style over artistry , praised the marks , pleased that the judges rewarded @entity15 's athleticism and degrees of difficulty over @entity6 's elegance
figure skating is , after all , a sport
but if it wants to be treated like one , it has to act like one
there is a long history of controversy and scandal that continues to hang over the @entity74 , particularly as @entity10 's first individual female gold medalist ( and on home ice , no less ) brings familiar echoes of the @entity4
and during the team competition , there were murmurs , to be sure , over @entity82 's high marks
it appeared to some that the judges bolstered his score based on his dynamic presence and the sentimental drama of the legendary champion 's return to the ice to lead the home team to gold , rather than the difficulty of his program and his execution of it
further , the sport had changed its scoring system to avoid this very situation
after the controversy that went down in @entity102 in 2002 over the pairs competition , in which @entity105 judge @entity104 tearfully confessed she had voted for the @entity10 pair in order to gain an advantage for the @entity105 ice dancers , the @entity100 revamped its scoring system
gone were the days of the perfect six
with the new system , too , judges are now anonymous , in hopes of relieving the sport of its former biases
back in 1994 , for example , when @entity118 took gold over @entity120 , the scores broke down along familiar lines : judges from @entity124 , @entity125 , eastern @entity126 , @entity127 and the @entity128 went for @entity118
@entity129 , @entity130 , the @entity131 and @entity132 put @entity120 first
although she skated cleanly , @entity120 had doubled a triple jump ; @entity118 , considered the superior artist , did a two - footed landing , and performed no triple - triple combination
four years later , while an @entity139 split was n't apparent in the battle between @entity142 's triple loop - triple loop combination and @entity144 's ability to make judges weep , it remained unclear who favored technique and who performed artistry
while few can say they actually comprehend today 's scoring system , it was designed to yield more balanced results supported by more intricate math. but the @entity100 needs to back these efforts with ethical and responsible judges
for the ladies free program , the panel included @entity10 @entity160 , who is married to the general director of the @entity10 skating federation , and @entity124 @entity163 , who had been suspended for attempting to fix the ice dancing competition in @entity165 in 1998
and this after rumors had dogged the ice dancing competition , with accusations that the @entity10 and the @entity131 ( maybe the @entity4 is over ! ) had colluded to shut out @entity129
there is likely little truth to the ice dancing gossip , but the @entity100 has done nothing to make us think otherwise
if the governing body wants us to talk about figure skating as a sport , it needs to ensure that it behaves like one , with credibility and transparency
because while the ladies podium may have been right , with scoring this complex and judges this questionable , why on earth would we believe it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .
