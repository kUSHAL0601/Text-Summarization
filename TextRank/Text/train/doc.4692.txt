never fear the night of the living dead -- the @entity0 has got you covered
from responses to natural disasters to a catastrophic attack on the homeland , the @entity3 military has a plan of action ready to go if either incident occurs
it has also devised an elaborate plan should a zombie apocalypse befall the country , according to a @entity0 document obtained by @entity16
in an unclassified document titled " @entity20 , " officials from @entity18 used the specter of a planet - wide attack by the walking dead as a training template for how to plan for real - life , large - scale operations , emergencies and catastrophes
and the @entity0 says there 's a reasonable explanation
" the document is identified as a training tool used in an in - house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario , " navy capt. @entity31 , a spokeswoman for @entity18 , told @entity16
" this document is not a @entity18 plan
" nevertheless , the preparation and thoroughness exhibited by the @entity0 for how to prepare for a scenario in which @entity3 are about to be overrun by flesh - eating invaders is quite impressive
read the @entity0 's @entity47 plan a wide variety of different zombies , each brandishing their own lethal threats , are possible to confront and should be planned for , according to the document
@entity58 life forms " created via some form of occult experimentation in what might otherwise be referred to as ' evil magic , ' to vegetarian zombies that pose no threat to humans due to their exclusive consumption of vegetation , to zombie life forms created after an organism is infected with a high dose of radiation are among the invaders the document outlines
" every phase of the operation from conducting general zombie awareness training , and recalling all military personnel to their duty stations , to deploying reconnaissance teams to ascertain the general safety of the environment to restoring civil authority after the zombie threat has been neutralized are discussed
and the rules of engagement with the zombies are clearly spelled out within the document
" the only assumed way to effectively cause causalities to the zombie ranks by tactical force is the concentration of all firepower to the head , specifically the brain , " the plan reads
" the only way to ensure a zombie is ' dead ' is to burn the zombie corpse
" there are even contingency plans for how to deal with hospitals and other medical facilities infiltrated by zombies , and the possible deployment of remote controlled robots to man critical infrastructure points such as power stations if the zombie threat becomes too much
a chain of command from the president on down along with the roles to be played by the @entity111 and the intelligence community for dealing with the zombie apocalypse are clearly spelled out in the document
' walking dead ' finale : the biggest reveals the training document was first reported by @entity118
this is also not the first time zombies have been used as the antagonist in @entity3 government training operations
both the @entity123 and the @entity124 have used the creatures as a vehicle for training their personnel in the past
defense officials stress the report in no way signals an invasion of zombies is on the horizon
the only real purpose of the document was to practice how to execute a plan for handling something as large and serious a situation like flesh - eating beings trying to overrun the @entity3
and why zombies ? officials familiar with the planning of it say zombies were chosen precisely because of the outlandish nature of the attack premise
" training examples for plans must accommodate the political fallout that occurs if the general public mistakenly believes that a fictional training scenario is actually a real plan , " the document says
" rather than risk such an outcome by teaching our augmentees using the fictional ' @entity159 ' or ' @entity161 ' scenarios used at ( @entity162 ) , we elected to use a completely impossible scenario that could never be mistaken as a real plan
" so , practice for the when , where and how to plan for a more likely disaster scenario ? yes
but zombies of all stripes would be well advised to take note of this directive to @entity18 personnel buried within the document
" maintain emergency plans to employ nuclear weapons within ( the continental @entity3 ) to eradicate zombie hordes
