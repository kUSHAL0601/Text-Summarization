@entity0 , @entity1 -- more topless photos of @entity4 , the @entity5 , spilled into public view monday as @entity8 's royal family asked a @entity10 court to stop further publication of the pictures
the legal battle raged while the duchess and her husband , prince @entity15 , carried on with an official tour of the @entity17 , including meetings with @entity1 -- some of them topless
the new photos were published monday by the @entity21 gossip magazine @entity20 , which is owned by the same company that last week published several pictures of a topless @entity4 sunbathing in private during a vacation at a private chateau belonging to @entity15 's uncle in @entity27 , in southern @entity10
the grainy images , shot from a distance , show @entity4 on a balcony and appear to be no more revealing than those published last week by the @entity10 magazine closer , the @entity29 newspaper reported
in a related development , @entity36 editor @entity35 was suspended monday by @entity38 , publisher of the @entity40 , pending an investigation into the circumstances that led to photographs being republished in that newspaper from the @entity10 magazine
opinion : wake up , @entity5 ; photogs are always watching while some have questioned the furor over topless sunbathing , which is a common practice in parts of @entity10 and elsewhere , the issue is less about nudity than it is about privacy , royal biographer @entity47 said
@entity15 and his brother , prince @entity56 , still blame the media for the 1997 death of their mother , princess @entity59 , in a traffic accident as her driver fled paparazzi , @entity55 said
@entity10 investigators concluded the driver of the car @entity59 was traveling in lost control while he was intoxicated
the royal family is concerned about similar invasions , particularly if @entity15 and @entity4 have a child , @entity55 said
" this is a deterrent
they 're drawing a line in the sand , " he said
@entity5 upset about topless photos on monday morning , the royal family filed a criminal complaint with @entity10 prosecutors seeking invasion of privacy charges against the magazine and possibly the photographer , a palace spokeswoman said
late monday in civil court in @entity87 , lawyers for the royals asked for damages and a court order to prevent the photos from being published again
they also want existing photos taken offline , a palace spokesman said
lawyer @entity95 denounced the published photos in court monday calling them an infringement of privacy , @entity2 affiliates reported
" it is a scene of married life , intimate , personal , that has nothing to do on a magazine " @entity95 said
@entity20 , the @entity21 magazine , put out its special edition monday with 26 pages of photos of @entity15 and @entity4 on vacation
as editors at @entity111 did last week , chi executives defended publishing the photos despite the furor from @entity114
" it is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love , " editor - in - chief @entity115 said in a statement
@entity20 and @entity111 are owned by the @entity126 publishing company , which is headed by @entity127 , a daughter of former @entity21 prime minister @entity128
" to see a future royal immortalized in a series of pictures , which are certainly neither morbid nor damaging to her dignity , renders her for sure more likable and less anachronistic and distant from of all of us , " @entity115 wrote
a @entity10 judge is expected to issue a ruling by 6 a.m. est tuesday on the civil complaint , reporters from @entity2 affiliates @entity135 and @entity136 have said
@entity17 welcome awaits @entity15 and @entity5 the criminal case in @entity10 involves claims of invasion of privacy against the magazine and possibly the photographer
@entity10 law provides for " draconian sanctions " to protect against this kind of behavior , @entity8 lawyer @entity148 said , including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines
but even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree , @entity158 said , the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge
@entity167 , editor - in - chief of @entity111 in @entity10 , defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity171 , saying , " we were just doing our job
" @entity167 said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos and that they show the royals " are just like any other couple in love
" legal analysts suggest that @entity126 hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales , thanks to the revealing pictures
according to @entity126 's website , @entity111 has an average weekly circulation of about 414,000 , while @entity20 sells more than 340,000 copies a week
opinion : @entity8 privacy should start with @entity8 press @entity15 and @entity194 tour marks a celebration of the queen 's @entity197 anniversary of her reign
they were scheduled to leave @entity0 in the @entity1 on tuesday and travel to @entity201 for the first royal visit to that island nation since 1982
their tour is scheduled to wrap up wednesday
monday 's legal actions in @entity10 are the only ones initiated by palace officials
@entity8 newspapers have not published the photos , although the @entity36 did saturday , in a move that palace officials slammed as greedy
editor @entity213 told the @entity214 that @entity216 readers wanted to know what all the " kerfuffle " was about
" she 's not the future queen of @entity216 , so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the @entity8 , " he said
in a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become , the newspaper 's co-owner , media group @entity224 , said it opposed he newspaper 's decision to run the pictures
the company -- which runs the @entity36 in a joint venture with @entity235 but does not exert editorial control over it -- said it was " profoundly dismayed " by the move
@entity235 said the decision to publish was regrettable and an investigation into the decision was under way
the @entity8 media are under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses
the conclusions of an independent judge - led inquiry , which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms , are expected by the end of the year
@entity8 tabloid prints naked prince @entity56 pictures the controversy comes three weeks after the @entity8 royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of prince @entity56 partying naked in a @entity261 hotel room
after @entity59 : how can intimate royal photos be published in @entity10 ? @entity2 's @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .
