@entity0 , @entity1 -- she gingerly walked from the car and shuffled up the small hill , her eyes welled in tears
the first sight of her daughter 's grave was too much for @entity11 to bear
she began to scream and flail
" @entity15 , @entity15 , @entity15 , " @entity12 cried , while two family members struggled to restrain her
on thursday , @entity17 's 11 - year - old daughter , @entity18 , became another victim of a tragedy unforgiving to both the old and the young
just hours earlier that day , @entity2 brought @entity22 's story to the world
for 48 hours she had lain trapped under the rubble since a 7.0 - magnitude earthquake struck @entity1 on tuesday
her right leg was crushed and pinned by a steel beam
" my lord @entity28 , save me ! " she cried
share your tributes to victims of the @entity1 earthquake no rescue teams could be found
caring neighbors and family desperately tried to cut through steel using a hacksaw
@entity2 correspondent @entity39 and photojournalist @entity40 , climbed up into the crevice that trapped @entity22 , and brought her water and granola bars
she reached out to hold their hands when she was scared
volunteers gave @entity22 a pair of glasses to protect her eyes from the dirt
" she spent 3 days in the hole
all that time saying , ' my @entity28 , i do n't want to die
i want to live , " said her aunt @entity54
on thursday night , neighbors found a power saw and a portable generator
soon after , @entity22 was free
but a happy ending eluded this story
@entity22 was rushed to a doctor , who could only offer some mild pain killers
the doctor told the family that they had to get @entity22 to a hospital about three hours away
her uncle said @entity22 was bleeding internally
she was so incredibly strong , he said , and was willing to have her leg amputated , to live
" she say , ' thank you , @entity28
because he save my life , " said @entity69 , in broken @entity70
" if i lose my feet
i always had my life , " he recalled his niece saying
but before the night was over , @entity22 was gone
@entity22 's family called her the " little lawyer , " because she wanted to study law one day
she sang in the choir at church and at school , and seemed to have found a special place in each of her family members ' heart
her aunt said she was just beautiful
" she said ... ' bring me a @entity85
there is a psalm i like a lot , which is @entity89 , ' " recalled her aunt , @entity91 @entity69
" she spent all her time reading the psalm
she said , ' my @entity28 , come help me
' " @entity22 's funeral was held in a church in @entity96 on friday night and @entity22 was buried -- wearing a @entity98 uniform and a veil in @entity96
@entity0 , about two hours away from the devastated capital of @entity101 , escaped the quake 's fury
this is where @entity22 's family has taken refuge -- and where they mourn the passing of a little girl with an angel 's voice .
