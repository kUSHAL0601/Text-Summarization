@entity0 , @entity1 -- while the whistleblower website @entity4 is shaking up the @entity5 and its diplomatic relations with the international community , @entity1 has got its own spate of " audio leaks " which has gripped local media and the public
the controversy has hit top government officials , some of the nation 's wealthiest tycoons and the ' @entity17
' recordings of phone conversations between a lobbyist and prominent journalists , industrialists and politicians leaked in the past few weeks reveal that some of @entity1 's most influential journalists served as power brokers for a deal that is considered one of @entity1 's biggest scams ever
the " 2g scam , " as it is known in @entity1 , involves telecommunications minister @entity30 underselling mobile phone licenses in the world 's fastest growing mobile phone market
the leaked audio tapes recorded in 2009 reveal lobbyist @entity36 asking senior journalists @entity37 , group editor of leading news channel @entity40 , and @entity41 , advisory editorial director of the @entity43 , to mediate with the ruling @entity44 about cabinet posts
the tapes suggest @entity36 was lobbying for the continuation of @entity30 's post as telecommunications minister after the 2009 elections and both journalists agreed to help
@entity1 auditors say this cost the country some $ 40 billion in lost revenues as the mobile phone licenses were sold at prices set in 2001 under @entity30 's watch
@entity30 was forced to resign last month , but the 2g scam has put parliament in a logjam for the past two weeks as recriminations fly across party lines
while allegations of corruption are commonplace in @entity1 , revelations that some of @entity1 's most influential journalists were involved have shocked the public
@entity37 is known as the ' @entity17 ' and @entity68 is a widely - read columnist
" it 's very , very disappointing
neither of them is corrupt , nobody is saying they are corrupt
but corruption when it involves ethics is worse then taking money , " senior political journalist @entity74 told @entity2
some 104 tapes have been leaked and are now widely available on the internet
the transcripts were first published in two @entity1 magazines , which sourced them to audio recordings submitted recently to the @entity85 as part of the 2g scam
while the recordings feature many conversations , the focus has been on @entity36 's multiple conversations with @entity37 and @entity41
in one conversation , @entity37 says to @entity93 , " what do you want me to tell them ( @entity44 ) ? tell me , i 'll talk to them
" in another recording , @entity41 tells @entity99 he can offer a fully scripted and rehearsed tv interview for @entity1 's wealthiest man @entity101
@entity36 's public relations firm represents @entity101 's @entity103 and the @entity104
" when i started out as journalist in @entity0 , the government had other ways of controlling the media
it used to be by giving free houses and other freebies like trips with the prime minister
now they are controlling access
so if journalists cooperate , they are given exclusive access to information , vip parties and this is most worrying , " @entity74 said
one of the recordings also features @entity36 's conversation with the head of @entity1 's largest conglomerate , @entity125
@entity125 petitioned the @entity85 on monday to bar further dissemination of the tapes , contending the leakage has infringed upon his fundamental right to privacy
" we have somewhat slipped into a morass of series of allegations ... unauthorized tapes flooding ... the media going crazy on alleging , convicting , executing ... literally character assassination ... stop this sort of @entity141 kind of attack , " @entity125 said in a statement
while both @entity37 and @entity41 have not denied the authenticity of the recordings , they both maintain they were simply placating a source for news gathering purposes and believe they have done no wrong
in a @entity155 post , @entity37 said : " unless we only cover news based on bland press conferences , we have to talk to all sorts , good and bad , i think there is nothing wrong in stringing along a source for info ... i think every journo has the right to engage a source , its no crime ... as a matter of record , i never passed the message
but info sharing per se is not immoral in a fluid news situation
" other senior journalists believe the @entity1 media is facing a crisis of credibility
" the feedback i 'm getting is nobody trusts us journalists anymore , " @entity74 said
" @entity176 and @entity41 are very good friends of mine , i still continue to respect them
but i just wish they had said sorry and ended it there
@entity1 has 300 television channels , most of them in very rural areas
if this is happening in @entity0 just look at the consequences lower down
