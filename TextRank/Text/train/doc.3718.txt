@entity0 -- @entity2 is creeping away from her @entity4 opponent in @entity7 's contentious @entity6 race , building a lead of 4 percentage points in the latest poll
the @entity12 candidate for @entity6 in @entity7 carries 49 % of support to @entity15 rep. @entity14 's 45 % according to a @entity17 poll released wednesday
six days before the election , @entity18 has the momentum in a race that could tip the balance of the @entity6 , picking up 2 percentage points since @entity17 's previous poll in mid-october
@entity18 gained support among independents , a key bloc that favored @entity14 in the previous @entity17 poll
@entity18 carried 51 percent of independent support to @entity14 's 41 % , a seven - point upswing for @entity18
republicans picked up an unprecedented lead in @entity7 's early ballot count last week after a beefed up early voter ground game and the two parties are now neck - in - neck in the early voting game
but the poll showed @entity14 still winning the early voting game , as @entity4 have done in the past , leading among the respondents who had already voted 57 % to 36 %
@entity14 and @entity18 held onto their edge with women and men , respectively , but @entity18 continues to carry male voters by a 17 - point margin compared to @entity14 's eight - point lead among women
@entity47 : not answering questions should be ' disqualifying ' @entity18 has consistently led in polls over the last month , but the four - point lead is her best number yet after polling from the @entity54 / @entity53 , @entity56 / @entity55 and the previous @entity17 poll all showed her lead at or below 3 percentage points
@entity14 's slumping prospects come despite @entity4 ' best efforts to boost @entity14 's candidacy with top class surrogates like first lady @entity64 and sen. @entity65 among others
@entity2 defends skipping @entity54 meeting former secretary of state @entity47 is also returning to the @entity7 on wednesday , with her husband former president @entity68 expected to rally voters with @entity14 on monday
@entity18 could also be benefiting from the prospects of @entity71 gov. @entity71 , who leads his @entity4 challenger by 19 points .
