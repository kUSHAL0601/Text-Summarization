@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police , the largest such purge in the institution 's history
the forced retirements , which were announced in the official gazette over the weekend , are widely seen as an attempt by @entity3 to combat corruption
among those forced out was the head of the national police
the new head of the police , @entity18 , mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony
" we have to uncover any act of corruption that stains the name of the police
from the most minimal to the most important , it does n't matter , same if one sol or more are stolen , " he said , referring to @entity1 's currency
in a separate interview on the state broadcaster tuesday , @entity18 said that fighting drug trafficking would remain a priority
the move means that until new generals are named , many regions in @entity1 , including many in the interior of the country , will be led by colonels instead of generals , something that opposition politicians have criticized
critics also voiced concerns that the move was a ploy by @entity3 , as a new president , to place commanders loyal to him in the top posts
his interior minister , @entity59 , said tuesday that the retirements had to do with a reorganization of a bloated institution , the state - run @entity57 news agency reported
" this is a studied measure , it is a re-engineering of the police , " he said
" it 's not possible that the police has so many generals
" before the purge , the police had 55 generals , 900 colonels , and more than 2,000 commanders , he said
