-- despite the retail madness of @entity3 , small businesses traditionally see little difference in their sales
bookstore owner @entity6 actually recalls losing revenue last holiday season after @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 battled each other in a price war over last season 's hardcovers
" people are concentrating on malls and stores for the big deals , " said @entity6 , owner of @entity16 , an independent business in @entity18 , @entity19
" we are n't exactly the focus of activity when everyone is looking for great deals on flat - screen tvs
" according to @entity29 , @entity30 retail expert and former small business owner , @entity3 has evolved to exclude smaller merchants
" since the big - box businesses came in with such financial strength in the last decade ... it 's been impossible for independent businesses to compete
" to boost small business sales , @entity30 held its first - ever @entity38 , where consumers are encouraged to spend locally
@entity40 said @entity38 is an opportunity for @entity30 to flex its financial muscle to help out local economies
" this is our way of working together ... to bring consumers back together with the independent businesses
" according to @entity47 , analysis and strategic planning consultants based out of @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 , @entity53 , 68 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays within the community
big retail chains keep 46 cents of every dollar within the community , the company says
with online purchases , unless the product is shipped to the same @entity62 as its origin , the local community keeps none of the profits , said @entity40
to motivate consumers , @entity30 gave a $ 25 credit to 100,000 card members who register their card and use it to shop on @entity38
@entity30 also gave $ 100 worth of @entity72 advertising to 10,000 business owners who signed up to participate on @entity72
despite @entity38 's widespread publicity , some small business merchants such as @entity77 boutique owner @entity75 had not ever heard of the program
and although some retailers knew of @entity38 , few reported noticeable sales increases
keys said two customers made purchases at her store on behalf of @entity38
" our sales are up today for a normal saturday
it 's hard to identify exactly why but i think [ @entity38 ] may be having some influence
" in @entity94 , @entity93 , toy store owner @entity92 saw little , if any , difference to clientele
" it 's a busy saturday this weekend regardless , but it did n't feel significantly busier because of @entity38
" yet , @entity40 said that the annual @entity38 is just the beginning of @entity30 ' effort to build up small businesses
the company plans to introduce more local business - building initiatives
" we want to make sure the independent business owner has a stake in the game again , " she said
" this is the way to do it
