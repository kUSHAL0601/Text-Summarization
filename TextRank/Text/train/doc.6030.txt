-- federal authorities began closing portions of central @entity4 's @entity3 as the swollen @entity5 receded wednesday , reducing the need to divert water down another waterway
the @entity9 announced wednesday that it already had closed three of the 17 open bays at the @entity3 , which was opened may 14 to prevent the @entity5 from flooding @entity12 and @entity13
the @entity9 said much as 1.2 million gallons ( 172,000 cubic feet ) per second had been pouring through the spillway , which diverted water through the @entity16 to the @entity18 west of @entity12
the resulting high water has caused some flooding down the @entity16
but the water levels " continue to be lower than anticipated " throughout the basin , corps spokesman @entity21 said in a statement announcing the decision
the river remained about four feet above flood stage wednesday night at @entity28 and about 7 feet over flood stage at @entity30 , on the approaches to the @entity18
but it was more than five feet lower at the town of @entity34 and about two feet below flood stage at @entity36 , about 20 miles south of the spillway
rising water levels forced @entity4 authorities to halt boat traffic down a four - mile stretch of the @entity16 around the town of @entity36 starting thursday , since the surface of the river had climbed to within seven feet of high - voltage power lines , the @entity38 announced
the 125 - bay @entity3 was last opened during a 1973 flood .
