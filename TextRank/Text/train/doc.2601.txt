-- captain @entity1 traveled to @entity2 with hopes of finding the remains of an old friend shot down more 60 years ago during the @entity6
instead , he returned home with an offer of talks for the @entity11 government
leader @entity12 is said to have been personally moved by @entity1 's story and has ordered his military to do all they can to help find his comrade 's remains
a surprising level of co-operation coming just months after @entity12 's regime made threats of a nuclear war with the @entity11
@entity2 : a sneak peek through the keyhole december 4 , 1950 , @entity1 was wingman to the @entity27 's first @entity26 - @entity11 pilot , @entity25
@entity25 was shot down deep within enemy territory and was trapped in his cockpit
@entity1 risked his life -- deliberately crash landing his own plane -- to try to rescue him
@entity25 died on the side of a mountain in the brutal @entity35 winter but @entity1 made him a promise he 'd be back for him
@entity1 did return to @entity2 but bad weather prevented him reaching the crash site
despite his disappointment , @entity1 says his 10 day visit has made him aspire to more
" our mission is just a part of a grand overall mission of preventing nuclear war and other types of war that could set us back to where we were 63 years ago
" @entity1 has sent a letter to @entity11 secretary of state @entity51 relaying @entity2 's wish to resume the joint recovery work of @entity11 remains that stalled in 2005
around 8,000 @entity11 are still @entity54 in the country but consecutive @entity11 governments have frozen the search for bodies due to @entity60 's nuclear ambitions
@entity2 's @entity12 honors country 's war veterans in his letter , @entity1 said the officials of the @entity65 told him " they wish for this humanitarian mission to continue regardless of the larger political issues
these men are soldiers and professionals whom i have looked in the eyes and come to trust
" @entity1 and fellow @entity6 veterans were surprised by the level of respect and hospitality they received from officers of the @entity65 who were escorting them throughout their trip
" sometimes you get with groups of veterans of other nations , " says @entity1 , " and there 's a guardedness that they have
they do n't want to say too much , they do n't want to get too close to you but these ... they 're very friendly
it 's almost as if we 're old allies getting together
" @entity1 acknowledges his hopes of this trip contributing to better relations may be naive but is considering the invitation to return to @entity2 in september
an advance team sent to the @entity98 or @entity99 by the @entity65 was stranded by the floods last week , but the @entity65 believes roads and helicopter landing pads can be repaired in a couple of months
the @entity65 does insist though it wants a representative of the @entity11 @entity106 / @entity105 ( @entity107 ) to accompany any future expedition to search for @entity25 's remains
this would require a decision by the @entity113 administration to actively re-engage with @entity2
state news : @entity2 proposes high - level talks with @entity11
