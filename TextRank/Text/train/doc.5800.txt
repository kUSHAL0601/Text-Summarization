-- from 1976 to 1985 the @entity1 were awesome
they had one of the best hitters in the game
they had sharp young pitchers
they were a part of almost every october
but the 1985 @entity9 comeback win over the @entity10 was the @entity1 ' last taste of glory until wednesday , when this year 's team rumbled back into the @entity9 , sweeping the @entity14 to win the @entity15
for much of the past 29 years , the @entity1 have n't been a baseball afterthought , they 've been a non-thought , except for their loyal fans
there 's plenty of room on the @entity1 bandwagon , so if you 're thinking about getting on , here are five things to consider : they 're not baseball royalty if asked to name one @entity29 , most people would say @entity30
if asked to name a current royal , most people would be silent
but do n't be too embarrassed , this is a team that does n't have any huge stars
they do n't even have many celebrity fans
we think they have one -- actor @entity40
they do n't make splashy news in the free agent market
they built a great team through some smart draft picks and augmented the roster through a few nifty trades
but none of the names in the lineup stands out to people who do n't closely follow the game
seriously , had you heard of @entity55 until october ? ( he was the most valuable player of the @entity15 , by the way ) they can pick it it seems like you ca n't hit a ball where the @entity1 ai n't
on wednesday , the @entity14 smoked four balls in the first two innings right on the nose
every one was turned into an out
the game was punctuated by a great catch by @entity68 , who slammed into the left - field wall just after his glove swallowed the ball
before the season , a whole lot of experts said the @entity1 had some of the best fielders in the majors , but then they made a 104 errors , including a stretch of 35 in 35 games
so far they 've had far more great plays than errors ( just three in eight games ) in a tense and tight postseason
they believe the @entity1 have n't lost in the post season since 1985
well , that 's in part because they have n't been in the playoffs since 1985 when they won the last three against the @entity10 to win the @entity9 , four games to three
but check this , they 've won 11 straight games in the postseason
all eight this year , most of them of the nail - biting , got ta - get - a - clutch - hit variety
they were four runs down and six outs from being bounced out of the playoffs before it really even started
but they rallied to beat the @entity102 in extra innings in a thrilling wild card game and dispatched the highly favored @entity105 with two extra-innings wins and a rare ho - hum easy " w " in the division series
they swept the @entity14 in four but they only outscored them by six runs
it helps the offense to know the bullpen is going to lock it down so all they have to do is keep it close , third baseman @entity111 said
" this team just does n't panic , " he said
they just have fun @entity121 knows
former royal @entity122 says the kids on this team are a joy to watch
" it 's been a long time since i 've seen professional athletes have fun and enjoy the heck out of coming to work every day , " he told sports host @entity126 this week
the lack of outward happiness could stem from the huge money that puts pressure on players to perform , he said
well , the not - so - regally compensated @entity1 -- they are 18th out of 30 teams in the majors in payroll at $ 91 million -- do n't take the field with high expectations or a lot of pressure
this team has been rebuilding and manager @entity144 accepts stumbles that come with a youthful team
" to watch them go through the last couple of years , the ups and the downs and to finally get to this point , i am very proud of them , " he said
they are due it was about a decade ago that the @entity1 lost 310 games in three years
it would n't even be june yet and @entity1 fans were already ready to give up
you never knew who the @entity1 fans were in your office because they never had anything to brag on
it 's been 29 years since their team had won a playoff game , let alone go to the @entity9
sure , there are teams with longer droughts , but these @entity1 are the likeable and plucky underdogs who just ca n't seem to be bothered with losing
