-- @entity1 underlined just why @entity2 agreed to pay him the big bucks on a scintillating evening of @entity5 football
the 28 - year - old , who inked a new five - year deal with the @entity9 club on sunday , completed a brilliant hat trick as @entity2 raced to a 6 - 1 rout against @entity12
@entity1 had the final say in @entity14 as he danced past three defenders before blasting the ball into the net for his hat - trick
summer signing @entity20 had got @entity2 off the mark when he picked up a long ball hit from beyond the halfway line by @entity24 and hit home after 33 minutes
from then on it was one way traffic as @entity28 and @entity1 added two goals apiece before @entity30 pulled one back for the @entity33 champions
the away victory saw the nine time @entity5 champions kick off a new era of @entity5 football under manager @entity37 in some style
a pulsating opening round of @entity41 group matches featured a flurry of firsts
former @entity45 boss @entity44 safely negotiated his first match in charge of @entity49 's title defence with an emphatic 3 - 0 win over @entity51
@entity52 hit home a dipping free kick to set the @entity55 on their way before @entity57 powered in a header in a dominant first half
@entity60 volleyed in a scooped pass from @entity52 to tick off a first @entity5 win for @entity44 and his defending champions
@entity64 also came through his first game as @entity67 manager unscathed as the club made its first @entity5 outing without sir @entity70 at the helm since 1985
@entity72 -- wearing a thick headband to protect an injury - set @entity67 on their way as he bundled home @entity75 's cross after 22 minutes
@entity77 leveled the match at @entity79 in the second half thanks to @entity81
but the @entity55 side 's relief was short lived as , just five minutes later , @entity85 scissor kicked the ball into the net to put @entity67 back in front
@entity64 watched @entity72 -- the star striker he sold to @entity67 from @entity89 in 2004 -- pounce again with his 200th goal for @entity67
the 27 year old coolly slotted in a low drive to become only the fourth player in the club 's history to reach the landmark
@entity67 poured forward on the break with some brilliant flowing play that was finished off with a fourth goal from @entity99
with two minutes on the clock , @entity100 pulled back another away goal for @entity77 but @entity67 came off the pitch 4 - 2 winners in the @entity105 clash
in the @entity108 , @entity107 recovered from a tentative start to cruise to a 3 - 0 away win against @entity112
@entity114 boss @entity113 led @entity115 to the @entity41 quarter finals last season and was looking for a positive display from his new charges
@entity120 broke the deadlock after half time when he slotted home a pass from @entity125 , who used his muscle to hold off the @entity108 defence
@entity128 conjured a curling goal from nowhere to double @entity107 's advantage before @entity125 finally got on the score sheet to complete a pleasing away win
@entity133 also earned a 4 - 1 win away at @entity135 while @entity137 @entity136 were held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity139 .
