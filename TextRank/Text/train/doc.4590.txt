@entity0 -- the @entity2 @entity3 thursday overwhelmingly passed a new version of the @entity5 , a bill aimed at people who lie about receiving military medals and then attempt to profit from the deception
the first version of the @entity5 was struck down by the @entity11 as a violation of the @entity13
justices dismiss law making lying about military honors a crime the bill focuses not on people who lie about having medals they did n't earn , but on any profits they make from lying about the medals , which is essentially criminal fraud
rep. @entity25 ( @entity26 ) sponsored the new bill
his office issued a release saying the bill passed by a vote of 410 - 3
@entity25 said in a floor speech this week that the bill would survive judicial review because it resolves the " constitutional issues by clearly defining that the objective of the law is to target and punish those who misrepresent the alleged service with the intent of profiting personally or financially
" the bill targets those who falsely claim to have earned certain major military decorations , including the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 or a medal signifying you served in combat
a similar bill is moving through the @entity54 , but has not reached a floor vote yet
the @entity44 : what is it ?
