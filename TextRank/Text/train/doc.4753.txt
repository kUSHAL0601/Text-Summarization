this may turn into much more than just a political scandal
it may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time , but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put @entity10 gov. @entity9 in the middle of a serious legal stew
and the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the @entity16 presidential hopeful , as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case friday
state lawmakers questioned one of @entity9 's allies on thursday , a former state official implicated in the scandal
so far , @entity26 has repeatedly refused to answer , invoking his @entity27 right against self - incrimination
what we 've learned from document released the legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation
but the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels , analysts say
as long as @entity9 was telling the truth at a marathon press conference he held on thursday , he should be able to step out of the caldron , analysts who spoke with @entity43 say
for nearly two hours the high - profile governor , who gained national recognition for his response to superstorm @entity52 , answered questions from journalists , divulging many details
" he was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it , " said @entity43 analyst @entity58 on the lead with @entity60
but if any of it does n't jibe with other peoples ' stories , information provided in documents or clues that pop up , experts say @entity9 could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits
the legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the @entity74 is just getting into gear
what happened to begin with ? it was september and @entity9 was full steam into his re-election bid -- which he won two months later
@entity26 , who @entity9 appointed to a high position at the @entity82 and @entity10 , ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the @entity74 in @entity87
it held up motorists trying to make it into @entity91 and caused days of massive traffic jams in @entity87 , where the @entity94 mayor @entity93 had declined to endorse @entity9 for re-election
democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against @entity93
hearings ensued , and @entity26 resigned under pressure
then came wednesday 's revelation that a top @entity9 aide , @entity103 had e-mailed @entity26 before the closures , telling him , " time for some traffic problems in @entity87
" " got it , " @entity26 replied back
he e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were @entity94 voters
@entity9 fired @entity103 after the scandal broke
possible prank , sure , but something to sue over ? this was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments , legal analyst @entity121 told @entity43 's @entity122
" it was utter chaos those days
people were pouring into the store , complaining , " @entity127 recalled thursday in her shop , @entity129 , in the town of @entity87
" the bridge is a lifeline here
you take away the bridge , you take away our livelihood
" that makes it a legal matter , @entity121 said
" the law looks backwards and says : what causes these harms ? " he said
one group of residents from @entity148 , where @entity87 is located , has already filed a class - action civil lawsuit against @entity9
they want to be compensated for alleged wages lost , when they arrived late at work
was a crime committed ? a woman died at the time of the mayhem , and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down
@entity93 thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident , saying it put " folks in absolute danger
" his @entity94 colleague , @entity10 state sen. @entity165 , agrees but takes it a step further
he called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman 's death
" endangering people 's lives -- that 's not politics
that 's why the @entity180 attorneys have to get involved , " he said
@entity182 spokeswoman @entity181 , said it 's " reviewing " whether federal laws were violated
but @entity186 's family does n't seem to want to press charges
she was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest , and her daughter @entity189 told @entity43 affiliate @entity190 that she did n't think the traffic was to blame
" i really do n't think so , no , i really do n't
i think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got ( to her house ) , " she said
but @entity186 was not alone
paramedics red - flagged " unnecessary delays for emergency services " to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures
legal analyst @entity121 thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against @entity26 , @entity103 and anyone else implicated , " particularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam
" @entity9 says he did n't know anything about this
how could this get him ? if @entity9 's close associates are prosecuted or convicted , it could lead them to turn on @entity9 , @entity121 said
thursday 's press conference was the longest and most candid in @entity9 's career , @entity10 public radio reporter told @entity60
" this is absolutely extraordinary , " he said
@entity9 offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing
at the same time , he may have given investigators fodder to work with , but also a lot for @entity26 and @entity103 to contradict , should they open up to lawmakers who questioning them
" they may very well want to save themselves and say , ' wait a minute ; do n't believe what the governor said , ' " @entity121 told @entity122
@entity26 may have pleaded the @entity27 initially , but that 's normal in the beginning , @entity228 told @entity43 's @entity231
" you do n't want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available
" but things could change
if lawmakers decide to go after @entity9 , they could offer @entity26 -- or @entity103 , if they question her -- immunity
they could decide to save themselves at his expense , @entity228 said
anyone @entity9 fired may also try to get revenge .
