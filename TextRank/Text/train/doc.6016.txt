@entity0 , @entity1 -- like many people , widow @entity3 plans to be buried alongside her family
but in her case , that includes a menagerie of family pets
her husband , @entity10 , who died of cancer three years ago at the age of 64 , is already buried with their horse @entity15 , blot the cat , @entity17 the dog , and even @entity19 the bird
" i often tell people that @entity10 has a canary singing in his ear , a cat purring at his feet , a dog at his side and a horse to ride on when he likes , " @entity3 said
" i know some people might find this strange , but i loved my pets and wanted them all to be close to me and my husband and to each other
" @entity3 , 66 , runs a pet crematorium and woodland burial place in @entity35 , @entity36 , in southwestern @entity1
she has buried more than 30 owners alongside their animals and has over 100 more plots reserved for pets and their owners , she said
the idea of joint burials was first suggested to her by an elderly neighbor who died at the age of 77 , a year before @entity10 's death , she said
" mrs. @entity47 had seven cats and wanted to be buried with all of them when she died
it was certainly an unusual request , " @entity3 said
" we had to apply for permission to extend our license to burying humans as well as animals , but it was wonderful that we could carry out her last wishes
" since then , @entity3 has seen an increasing number of pet owners in the @entity60 seeking joint burials
there are currently only half a dozen cemeteries in the @entity60 that allow pets to be buried in the same plot as their owners , but in january , @entity68 council became the latest authority to grant planning permission for a joint site
" i think there has been more interest recently because people are starting to realize it is possible , " @entity3 said
one of her customers is animal lover @entity77 , 54 , who has reserved a plot for herself and her husband @entity79 next to their 17 - year - old golden retriever , @entity82 , who was buried at @entity35 in 2008
" i know it is n't conventional , but i 'm so sick of people saying that ' it was just a dog or a cat , ' " @entity77 said
" animals give us unconditional love and i absolutely adore my pets
if people want to call me kooky i do n't care
" the @entity60 regards itself as a nation of animal lovers , so perhaps it is not surprising that there has been an increase in joint burials , but the practice is also on the rise in the @entity101
" there has been a lot of interest from the public , who are asking funeral homes if they can have their pets buried with them , " said @entity102 of the @entity103 in @entity104
" it 's still a relatively new concept , so whether it 's a fad or an emerging trend , i 'm not sure , but it 's definitely on the rise , " he said
" we are seeing an increase in public interest , " said @entity116 , director of @entity117 in @entity118
" the joint burial concept started in 2006 , when a few people were interested -- but last year we had close to 70 joint burials in our cemetery
" in fact , the practice of people being buried with pets is n't new
it dates far back into @entity60 history when @entity133 nobles were buried with their possessions , which included their horses
even further back , the pharaohs of ancient @entity137 would be buried with their mummified cats , dogs and monkeys , which they believed shared an afterlife with humans
but after centuries of affiliation with the pagan gods of @entity137 and @entity148 , pet rituals found little tolerance in the new @entity151 era
" the more @entity151 became institutionalized , the more animal practices were discouraged as it was accepted that humans were the only beings with souls , " said @entity152 , a @entity154 - based anthropologist who specializes in the shared history of people and pets
the director of the @entity60 's @entity161 and @entity162 said people should be buried as they see fit
" when you pass away , it 's important to have your wishes granted and people deserve to be buried in the manner they choose if they are not hurting anyone , " @entity164 said
" my horse was such a good friend and by my side through the ups and downs of life , " pet cemetery owner @entity3 said
" like me , many others see their pets as part of the family and want to be together with them even in death
