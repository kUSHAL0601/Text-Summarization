@entity0 -- @entity2 faces possible jail time after a judge revoked his probation monday in connection with his conviction in the beating of his girlfriend @entity9
@entity2 's alleged failure to hand over his drivers license and insurance information to another driver after a minor traffic crash in may triggered the probation revocation , but the singer will remain free until a trial is held
@entity2 , 24 , was already facing a probation violation trial after prosecutors accused him of not completing the community labor ordered for his 2009 felony assault conviction
a representative for @entity2 , however , said the singer expects the traffic charges to be dropped and probation reinstated
a lawyer for the other driver said in a court hearing monday morning " that his client did not want to press charges , that any damage was " negligible " and that @entity2 did identify himself at the scene and that she was given all of the appropriate insurance information , " the @entity2 rep said in a statement to @entity1 monday evening
" we are hopeful that the case will be dismissed next week , " the rep said
a woman whose @entity42 was allegedly rear - ended by a @entity43 that @entity2 was driving on a @entity0 street told investigators that he " went ballistic " after the traffic accident and screamed at her
according to the police report on the incident , the other driver , @entity47 , quoted @entity2 as shouting at her : " you are a b --- h ! " @entity2 charged with hit - and - run the report added more from @entity47 , who quoted @entity2 as saying , " who do you think you are , b --- h ? do you think if you driving @entity42 so got money , b --- h ? do you think i am just a black n --- - r ? i got more money than you , beech ! " the trigger for @entity2 's alleged rage was that @entity47 took a photo of him and his girlfriend , @entity67 , to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver 's license , she said
when @entity2 tried to grab the camera , @entity70 screamed " do n't touch her , do n't touch her , " @entity47 said
" i was so shocked , that i was speechless , " she said
" just a moment ago he was a nice guy
after screaming some insulting nonsense for a while longer , he slammed a door and drove away fast and noisy
" a private investigator visited her two days later to give her @entity2 's name , birthdate and business address and the contact information for @entity2 's lawyer , @entity81 , she said
she was also given an expired insurance card for the @entity43 , she said
a body shop estimate showed @entity47 's car needed $ 868 in bumper repairs
@entity2 was ordered to return to court on august 16 for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand
if it does , @entity91 judge @entity90 could order @entity2 to jail to serve part of the original five - year jail sentence imposed for the attack on @entity9
another judge continued the traffic case against @entity2 during a hearing monday morning
he is charged with hit - and - run driving and driving without a license
the ever divisive @entity2 @entity2 's @entity103 defense @entity2 used his @entity103 account to protest the traffic charges last month : " it 's not a hit and run if u get out the car , exchange information ( who has no damage to either cars )
this is really ridiculous " " i have a valid drivers license and i gave the woman the right info
she saw cameras and wanted to make a scene
" " she contacted the cops thinking of a payday from @entity2 when i followed the proper procedures
" " my lawyers will be contacting you
i will not stand for this bullying and yellow journalism ! " " my profile pic is the pic i took of the persons car after " the hit and run "
once again , i got ta clear my name " " i work my ass off to provide for my entire family
i 've made mistakes in the past and have worked hard to be a better person
" " 19 - 24 years of age
i do n't have all the answers and you ca n't show me a person that age who has it figured out
let me live " @entity2 totals car with dodging paparazzi , rep says another probation violation charge @entity2 punched @entity9 inside a rented @entity151 on a @entity153 street , leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the @entity156 in february 2009
he entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in " labor - oriented service " for the assault conviction
the judge allowed him to serve the sentence in @entity163 , @entity164 , under the direct supervision of the police chief
in a court filing in february 2013 , prosecutors accused @entity2 of not completing the community labor
the paperwork @entity2 submitted to show he had completed community labor is " at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting , " district attorney @entity172 said
@entity2 was n't in town on some of the dates reported , the motion said
@entity81 , @entity2 's attorney , said the prosecutor 's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court
" and i do n't mean just false , it is fraudulent , " @entity81 said
the @entity188 district attorney 's office has " tortured " @entity2 during his probation more than any client he 's ever had , @entity81 said
the prosecutor is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a @entity0 probation officer
@entity9 shows support in court for @entity2
