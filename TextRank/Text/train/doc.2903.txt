-- @entity2 's fingerprint sensor , @entity1 , is the flagship feature on the @entity4
but it does n't always work the way it should
since the sensor 's introduction in september , a growing number of issues have surfaced — including everything from phones that do n't recognize when a finger is present to those that do n't approve fingerprints they 're supposed to approve
what 's going on here ? while faulty software or hardware could be to blame in a few cases , the problem might also be you
determining the real culprit requires a closer look at how @entity2 's sensor technology really works
touch id is composed of an 8 x 8 millimeter , 170 - micron - thick capacitive sensor located just beneath the home button on the 5s
this is used to capture a 500 - pixel - per - inch ( ppi ) resolution image of your fingerprint
the sensor can read pores , ridges , and valleys
it can identify arches , loops , and whorls
it can even recognize fingerprints oriented in any direction
when you place your finger or thumb on the sensor , it looks at the fingerprint pattern on the conductive sub-dermis layer of skin located underneath the dermis layer
it also measures the differences in conductivity between the tops of the ridges and the bottoms of the valleys in your prints in this layer
this is more accurate than looking at the dead surface of the skin alone , which is constantly changing and is n't conductive
13 of the @entity70 's @entity69 this capacitive sensor is made of raw silicon
as such , it tends to be very fragile and susceptible to performance problems caused by dust , moisture , and electrostatic discharge , or @entity78
to protect and insulate the sensor , @entity2 layered laser - cut sapphire crystal on top of the silicon
it chose sapphire for a few reasons
the material is very clear , and it acts as a lens for your fingerprint
it 's also hard ( it scores a 9 on the @entity91 scale of hardness ) , which means it 's difficult to scratch
if the home button does get scraped or scuffed , the images sent to the @entity1 sensor will be flawed and it will cease to work properly
what 's more , a stainless steel ring encircles the button and acts as a capacitive touch switch , turning the actual touch sensor on and off when a finger is present so it does n't eat up your @entity4 's battery life
which should you buy : @entity108 or @entity109 ? after you register your fingerprint — a process known as enrolling — an encrypted mathematical representation of that information is stored on the device 's @entity116 processor in what 's called the " secure enclave
" when the sensor captures an image , software algorithms determine whether the print is a match with the stored information or not
a match allows access to the homescreen
there are obviously a few possible points of failure in this process , but it all hinges on first getting that robust fingerprint data
" any good biometric has to start with a high - quality image , " @entity138 ' ceo @entity137 told @entity139
his company makes a variety of compact fingerprint sensors that use a different method from @entity2 's @entity1 ( electroluminescence and a thin film transistor ) to read fingerprints
basically , the larger the sensor , the easier it is to pick up a more accurate representation of your full fingerprint because it 's working with more data
this makes it easier for recognition algorithms to confirm that your fingerprint actually belongs to you
but a larger sensor also introduces two problems : cost , in the case of a capacitive scanner like @entity2 's , and thickness , in the case of another popular fingerprint technology , optical sensing
( you 've probably used the latter at the @entity169 or gym
) the 13 best movies you did n't see in 2013 based on what we 've seen from @entity2 's patent applications , it 's highly likely the company considered other implementations of a touch sensor
but ultimately , it opted for a smaller version that could more easily fit inside the home button
@entity2 partially gets around the small sensor issue using the enrollment process , which includes rolling your finger around to try to capture every microscopic nook and cranny on your finger
then , at least , it has a large source to pull from , even if it 's only scanning a section of that each time you tap your finger
still , the less data you have from a fingerprint to process , the harder it is to get a match
@entity199 coo @entity198 offers a good analogy : if you have a picture of a face and you see only a small part of that picture — the eyes , or part of one eye — it will be hard to recognize if it is a friend , or someone you do n't know
if you have the full face , it 's easy to process
seeing only a portion of a fingerprint sets higher and higher requirements on software algorithms , @entity198 says
indeed , the more sensitive the algorithm ( to get a more exact match ) , the more false - negatives ( failed when it should have passed ) are produced , which may frustrate a valid user , according to @entity223 , cto of biometric identity service startup clear
16 gifts @entity226 " the challenge is then to find that happy balance of acceptable false - negatives and false - positives and user experience , " @entity223 says
for security 's sake , you would want the algorithm to veer towards false - negatives rather than false - positives
@entity2 's @entity1 algorithm is designed to learn and improve over time — with each scan , it checks if it is a better reading than what is stored , and can update the master data for your print this way
this algorithm could certainly be changed or improved through @entity247 updates , as well
user error , and a lack of knowledge about biometrics and how they work , could also be causing some people 's issues with @entity1
" a lot of us in the industry , we are very impressed by the job @entity2 has done with @entity1 , " @entity198 said
" but on the consumer side , a lot of people have never used biometrics at all
" @entity263 founder reveals @entity264 for getting @entity265 there are a variety of small things that could be going on to interrupt a successful @entity1 experience
first , for it to work properly , your finger needs to make contact not just with the sapphire of the home button , but also the stainless steel ring surrounding it
next , the sensor itself works by measuring electrical differences between the ridges and valleys of your fingerprints
if your hands are too dry , it 's going to be difficult for your print to be recognized ( this could be a growing problem in the dry winter months ahead )
conversely , if your fingers are too moist or oily , recognition can also fail , as those valleys get filled
if the button gets dirty , as it likely will over time , you 'll also want to clean it to keep @entity1 working properly
@entity2 suggests using a clean , lint - free cloth
but what about that touch sensor itself ? some have worried that , like traditional capacitive - based fingerprint sensors , it will degrade over time
@entity301 thinks that as long as the sapphire crystal and metal ring are not damaged and are properly sealed , the sensor should last the life of the phone
capacitive sensors in the past were unprotected , or covered in a very thin layer of carbon , and thus were very fragile
the @entity311 ever made of @entity313 's @entity312 for those experiencing @entity1 issues that cause their phone to freeze , or to not work as well over time , restarting the phone or recalibrating the sensor are your best bets
and if you 're new to touch id or having trouble , @entity2 also has a guide you can reference for help
fingerprint sensors may not be a new technology
but @entity1 is certainly a new implementation of it
it 's bound to experience some bumps as @entity2 tweaks its algorithms , and as users get accustomed to using biometrics on a daily basis
at the very least , by understanding how it works and the inherent pitfalls of fingerprint sensors , we can help minimize those issues ourselves
