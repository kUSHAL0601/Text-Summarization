@entity0 -- president @entity2 renewed his push for comprehensive immigration reform thursday , calling for bipartisan cooperation on an issue that has repeatedly proven to be a major cause of deep social and political division
the president tried to find what has often proven to be an elusive middle ground on the subject , highlighting the importance of immigrants to @entity16 history and progress while also acknowledging the fear and frustration many people now feel with a system that seems " fundamentally broken
" he asserted that the majority of @entity16 are ready to embrace reform legislation that would help resolve the status of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants
" i believe we can put politics aside and finally have an immigration system that 's accountable , " @entity2 told an audience at @entity0 's @entity27
" i believe we can appeal not to people 's fears , but to their hopes , to their highest ideals
because that 's who we are as @entity16
" the president targeted @entity39 's controversial new immigration law , which requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there 's reason to suspect they 're in the @entity16 illegally
it also targets businesses that hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them
the measure -- currently under review by the @entity54 -- has " fanned the flames of an already contentious debate , " @entity2 said
it puts pressure on police officers to enforce rules that are " unenforceable " while making communities less safe -- in part , by making people more reluctant to report crimes
it also has " the potential of violating the rights of innocent @entity16 citizens and legal residents , making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound
" @entity39 's @entity71 governor , @entity70 , responded thursday that @entity2 was failing to secure the border with @entity73 , which forced her state to act on its own
secure the border , " @entity77 said of the president in a speech to a @entity71 group
she pledged to " defend this law against every assault , including attacks by the @entity2 administration
" in his speech , @entity2 warned that rounding up everyone in the country who has entered illegally would be both " logistically impossible " and " tear at the fabric of the nation
" at the same time , the president indicated it would be wrong to offer blanket amnesty for people who came into the @entity16 unlawfully
to do so " would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision
and this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration
... it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally
" ultimately , he said , " our nation , like all nations , has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship
and no matter how decent they are , no matter their reasons , the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable
" @entity2 said those who entered the country illegally must admit they broke the law , register with the appropriate authorities , pay taxes , pay a fine , and learn @entity130
they must " get right with the law before they can get in line and earn their citizenship
" the president urged @entity137 to tackle immigration reform legislation , but stressed that it would require support from both @entity140 and @entity71
" that is the political and mathematical reality , " he said
@entity2 's remarks , however , immediately received a cold reception from one top @entity145 @entity71
@entity2 and congressional democrats " made a strategic decision to put immigration on the back burner , and they now claim they ca n't even propose immigration legislation without a @entity71 , " said sen. @entity146 , @entity147
" it 's time for the president and congressional democrats to stop the charade
op - eds , outlines and speeches wo n't cut it anymore
" senate majority leader @entity164 , @entity165 , in turn lashed out the @entity71 , arguing that " instead of matching the leadership of @entity140 to solve this problem and engaging in good faith negotiations , @entity71 continue to engage in political grandstanding and polarizing rhetoric that encourages intolerance of our vibrant immigration population
" @entity164 , who is facing a tough reelection fight this year , is hoping for a strong turnout among @entity177 voters in november in his home state
despite @entity2 's call for bipartisan immigration reform , several senior @entity140 sources said thursday that they see virtually no chance of @entity137 taking up such a measure before november 's midterm elections
though some hold out hope for potential movement during a lame - duck session of @entity137 after the election , most sources say the more realistic earliest target is next year
but even that , according to one source , may be " happy talk
" still , these sources said that , politically , it was crucial for the president to give a speech like he did thursday in order to put pressure on @entity71 and , more importantly , to reassure angry @entity177 voters that @entity140 have n't forgotten about the issue
a @entity204 national poll conducted in late may indicated that public support for beefing up security along the @entity16 border with @entity73 had grown significantly
according to the survey , nearly nine out of 10 @entity16 want to beef up @entity16 law enforcement along the border with @entity73
eight in 10 questioned also supported a program that would allow illegal immigrants already in the @entity16 to stay here and apply for legal residency if they had a job and paid back taxes
but only 38 percent say that program should be a higher priority than border security and other get - tough proposals
six in 10 said border security was the higher priority
@entity2 's speech followed a highly anticipated meeting this week in which the president discussed immigration reform with grass - roots reform advocates
" from our meeting , it is clear that the president is committed to comprehensive immigration reform and understands that congressional action is needed urgently , " said @entity229 , executive director of the @entity230 and a meeting attendee
other topics discussed at the meeting included concerns the grass - roots leaders had about reforms to current detention and deportation procedures , @entity229 said
@entity1 's @entity245 contributed to this report
