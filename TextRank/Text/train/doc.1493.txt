-- if you 're not @entity3 , chances are you have never been as acutely aware of the political happenings of that country as you are now
@entity6 , the embattled and out - of - control mayor of @entity8 , has made sure of that , with his erratic behavior blazing across our screens more boldly and brightly than the reddest maple leaf that nation has ever produced
@entity16 's booze - soaked stunts and possibly drug - driven debacles -- now feeding the tabloids and late night talk shows more meat than they could digest in a year -- are probably nothing you have n't read about , talked about , thought about , or , unfortunately , laughed about
but what you might not have thought about is this : you know this man
you know and respect this man
he lives next door to you
he 's related to you
he might even be you
he is , in fact , everywhere
and there 's nothing funny about it
oftentimes functioning at levels you would never expect from someone with an addiction , the @entity6 in your life is trying your case , prescribing your medication , running your company , investing your money , flying your plane and governing your city
and guess what ? he or she is doing it from the grips of a progressive disease , making it look easy until , well , one day it suddenly looks horrible
i know -- i 've been there
was my own powerful reckoning with alcohol as excruciatingly documented and publicly consequential ? mercifully , no. not even close
could it have been , under different circumstances ? yes , perhaps
when you laugh at the mayor of @entity8 , you are laughing at the struggles of countless people like him that you 'll never know about
people who you otherwise admire and sometimes even vote for
you see , the biggest difference between mayor @entity6 and millions of other alcoholics and addicts who have built a successful career is n't that his behaviors are so much more shocking , it 's that his are alone in the center of a spotlight , on full display like the unsightly scar most of us are able to keep private
and he 's the mayor of one of the largest cities in @entity78
but if you dim that light and pause those digital recorders , you 'll see the mayor is not alone
surrounded by a vast sea of others shrouded in the same , strong , delusional fog of denial
a fog that 's born from the marriage of disease and diploma , sickness and success
and , you 're surrounded by them , too
hiding in plain sight , addicted yet outwardly successful professionals are a carefully disguised contradiction
we do n't have a problem with our drinking
other people have a problem with their drinking
you know , the type of people who could n't do half of what we 've done
the people who could n't even get our job , let alone do it
even when startling evidence to the contrary begins piling up , as it so clearly has with mayor @entity6 , we stick to our story and cling to our capabilities
to paraphrase the mayor , if we were alcoholics , we could n't show up to work every day
until the bitter end and long after the other relationships in our lives have tanked , we suit up and show up
and as long as we 've got that , we 're not alcoholics
or so our inner monologue goes
but , if you pierce through that devastatingly convincing argument we sell ourselves , and you , each of us is a walking bundle of profound denial , tightly bound up by an impressive tailored suit , spotless lab coat or an elegant black robe
bolstered by a track record of academic or professional victories , we 've got a deep stockpile of accomplishments to call upon in our war against reality
we have a formidable arsenal of achievements deftly deployed against you and your little idea that we need help
that 's cute -- that you think we need help
but you do n't get it
we 're not the kind of people who need help
do you even understand how talented and smart we are ? although denial is the hallmark characteristic of all alcoholics and addicts , unfortunately for us ours comes with a resume that pumps our ego and demands your respect
until , that is , it eventually does n't
last year i was sitting in my office with a client -- a highly successful , highly regarded attorney with a highly advanced drinking problem -- who after years of fervently denying his problem finally found his truth
he looked me dead in the eye , breathed a slow sigh of calm relief and said plainly : " the jig is up
" from that moment forward , his life changed
his denial had collapsed , thankfully before he did
so what was responsible for his long overdue recognition of the obvious and surrender to reality ? it was the fact that those around him had stopped excusing his reluctance to seek help out of deference to his professional stature
no longer were people overlooking his sickness out of respect for his career
more important , neither was he
as our science moves toward a better understanding of addiction and our culture moves toward a greater acceptance of it , it 's important to keep in mind that this disease walks upright through all corridors of our society , even those in the house of that accomplished professional next door
we might want to stop laughing now
