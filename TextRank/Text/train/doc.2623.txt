in our @entity4 series , @entity1 correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events
@entity1 's @entity10 and @entity11 visited @entity12 for " @entity13 : the @entity14 " which rebroadcasts tonight at 8 p.m. et. " i want to have everything that an average @entity19 would want , " said @entity16 who served time in prison
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity16 walked out of @entity12 in june after serving four years of hard time for possession of crack cocaine and a weapon charge
he joined at least 3,000 men paroled each year in @entity20 , @entity21 , where the recidivism rate is more than 50 percent
when our documentary team first met @entity16 inside @entity12 in 2008 , he considered himself one of the lucky ones
at 21 , he entered prison with a fourth - grade education , but left with a @entity34 certificate and was only a few semesters short of earning an associate degree
@entity16 told us there were few role models around him as a kid
he said his father left home before he entered the first grade , his mother was a crack addict and he was surrounded by a lot of violence
ironically , @entity12 is where @entity16 met the kind of role models he said he needed to break the cycle of incarceration
his hard work and determination to change caught the eye of @entity55 , who runs a program called @entity57
twice a week , @entity55 goes into @entity12 with the goal of transforming men like @entity16 from drug entrepreneurs to business entrepreneurs
upon his release , @entity16 replaced his dreadlocks and prison uniform with casual attire and a neatly manicured haircut
he said he felt relieved after the harsh conditions of prison life , but said he struggles every day in his @entity20 neighborhood to resist the temptations of making easy money by selling crack cocaine
" i want to have a family
i want to own a house
i want to have everything that an average @entity19 would want ; a good - paying job , a career , " he said
but the odds are against him
nearly 1 million black men are behind bars , an especially crippling blow to black communities , where one in three black men will have a prison record in their lifetimes
they leave behind communities filled with fear , broken families and a generation of vulnerable children
after @entity16 left @entity12 , @entity55 was in contact with him twice a week and helped him land a part - time job at @entity94
at @entity94 , @entity16 spent 30 hours a week in a labor - intensive job , stacking goods and preparing them for shipment
" i remember reading a lot of these very same books in prison , " said @entity16 as he was busy working
he was grateful to have a job , but frustrated because it paid so little , $ 7 an hour
that job lasted only a few months
when we caught up with him in january , he had been unemployed for a while
as he sat in @entity20 's @entity107 watching the inauguration of president @entity109 , he wondered how he was going to help support his girlfriend and her daughter and earn enough tuition money to continue working toward his degree
@entity16 has moved a few times , but is still hoping for success , still fighting against long odds , particularly in a severely debilitated job market
he 's hopeful that his hard work and the skills he learned through @entity57 will be a much better alternative than making easy money on the street -- a certain pathway back to prison
" every day of my life , with or without work , i feel vulnerable , " said @entity16
" instead of waking up every day and going to a 9 - to - 5 ; i used to wake up and go outside and sell some drugs and have my money for a whole week
" " it crosses my mind , but i got to a point where i 'm disciplined and do n't need to venture into it
" a few weeks ago , @entity16 was hired as a courier for a local printing business
the job pays $ 9 per hour ; $ 2 more than his previous job
he says the new job wo n't be enough to pay all the bills , but his goal is to build a résumé so future employers will take a chance on an ex-convict who 's trying to recover from a mistake that cost him four years of his life .
