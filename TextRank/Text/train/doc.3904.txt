you go for some target practice , look down the firing range and see at the other end that one of the targets is -- your brother , an old photo of him
@entity9 was devastated to see her brother @entity11 's image pierced by police sniper bullets , she told @entity13 in an exclusive report
but his photo was n't the only one of an @entity17 being used for target practice last november
there were six bullet - riddled mugshots of black males at the range
racism ? no , says @entity25 police chief @entity24
two of his snipers were using them for target practice -- one of them is @entity30 , and the other a black male of @entity34 descent
their target , a row of black men , which the snipers left behind at the stand , was one of many
there are also groups of white males , @entity30 males and white women
picking the target carefully there are 22 images in all , including a white man holding a gun to a white woman 's head and one of now - dead @entity56 leader @entity55
" the same target inventory has been used for more than a decade , " @entity24 said in a statement
the idea is to have an array of photos with faces that look similar , so the sniper can practice exactly picking out the right target and avoid killing the wrong person in a real - life situation , @entity24 said
the department uses mugshots of people they arrested 10 to 15 years ago , and @entity70 was one of them
@entity9 told @entity13 that he was booked after a deadly drag race
he has walked the straight and narrow ever since , he said
" i can sympathize with the family discovering their brother 's photo on the target , " @entity24 said
@entity24 became aware of the family being upset in late december and ordered an investigation
it turned up no violations of law or department policy
" we realize how important this issue is during today 's climate , " @entity24 said
snipers will no longer use mugshots of people they have arrested , but instead will buy practice pictures from commercial vendors
and they are instructed from now on to destroy their targets after they 're done .
