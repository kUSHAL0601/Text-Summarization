@entity0 -- @entity2 led a dozen @entity3 in a video aimed at reminding president @entity5 that he told the world four years ago of the need to eliminate all nuclear weapons
" i demand zero , " said each star , including @entity11 winners @entity2 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16

" @entity1 poll : @entity5 approval falls amid controversies the celebrities -- also including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 -- tag - team to deliver @entity5 's words : " this matters to people everywhere ... some argue that the spread of these weapons can not be stopped , can not be checked ... such fatalism is a deadly adversary ... for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable , then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable
to denounce a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do
that 's how wars begin
that 's where human progress ends
make no mistake , when we fail to pursue peace then it stays forever beyond our grasp
it will take patience and persistence
but now we must ignore the voices who tell us that the world can not change
human destiny will be what we make of it
let us bridge our divisions , build upon our hopes , accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it
