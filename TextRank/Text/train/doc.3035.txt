@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you 've been in @entity0 for the queen 's @entity4 , you 'll almost certainly have seen the city 's " other royals " : the @entity8 of @entity0
" we 'll all be out in full - swing where we 're needed , " @entity9 , the pearly queen of the @entity10 told @entity2 before the celebrations kicked off
" we are a recognizable part of @entity0
i have a vision that when people go out to buy souvenirs like red - letter boxes and things like that
well , maybe one day , there will be a little pearly queen fridge magnet ! " with their colorful feathered hats and hand - sewn pearl button suits , the pearlies are an instantly recognizable @entity0 institution dating back 150 years
it all started with @entity28 , an orphan turned street - sweeper and rat - catcher in @entity0
at first , the young @entity28 struggled on the streets of @entity0 but he found help with the @entity33 of @entity34 -- apple sellers in @entity0 's @entity36

inspired , @entity28 decided to create his own version -- covering every inch of a three - piece suit and top hat with pearl buttons
his theatrical flair attracted a lot of attention and @entity28 found he was soon earning more money than he needed
so , he donated much of it to charity , funding the @entity0 orphanage where he grew up
when he died in 1930 , hundreds of mourners attended the funeral
@entity28 's charity work had become so well - known that he appointed a @entity60 in each of @entity0 's boroughs before he died to carry on his works
the pearlies have been working ever since , handing down their inherited titles and duties from generation to generation
in may , several pearlie families gathered at the @entity70 pub in @entity36 for a pearlie coronation
nine pearly kings and queens were crowned
in fact , it was the biggest pearlie coronation since the 1960s
read more : @entity75 , pageantry and pouring rain @entity9 and her 13 - year - old daughter @entity78 were crowned the pearly queen of the @entity10 and the pearly queen of @entity81 , respectively
traditionally , each pearlie sews their own pearl button suit before being crowned , often decorated with family symbols : a heart for charity , a horseshoe for luck , for example
@entity9 pairs her new suit with a sleek set of jet black @entity95 shoes but admits she had a little help sewing on the hundreds of pearl - buttons
" it 's a fantastic tradition
it 's a role model ambassador
we stand for the good old days
what you 're seeing is a real cockney knees - up
" she said " wherever basically we can pitch up and raise money
" " my friends think it 's really cool
" @entity78 chimes in , " some of them think it 's kind of strange
but most think it 's cool and something really fun
which it is ! " interactive : 60 years of royalty , discovery and global events a " cockney knees up " is exactly what draws many people to the @entity8
tourists crammed into the modest pub , pints in hand , to catch a glimpse of the coronation proceedings
with lots of laughing and a bit of shouting , nine shiny , plastic crowns and polyester - ermine cloaks were placed on the heads and shoulders of the new pearly kings and queens
the coronation itself is brief but the celebration last long into the summer evening
the music strikes up and the pearlies begin their rounds with plastic buckets , collecting spare change for charity
it may not seem like much but it adds up
@entity145 , the pearly queen of @entity146 , raised more than $ 100 thousand dollars for her charity last year
she proudly displays her suit of 19 thousand pearl buttons she sewed herself
on the lapels , are the pins of at least a dozen charities she has helped
" we do n't ask for a fee , but we charge a donation for our chosen charities
" she explains proudly , " now , my daughter 's a pearly queen and my grandchildren are princes and princesses
it 's a lovely tradition
