@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first distress call from the ferry @entity6 came not from the crew , but from a boy who used a cell phone to contact emergency services from aboard the sinking ship , the @entity1 coast guard confirmed to @entity2 tuesday
@entity2 affiliate @entity12 reported that the boy dialed @entity1 's emergency number , telling dispatchers for a local fire service , " help us
" the boy 's fate was not clear
it was not until three minutes later , the coast guard told @entity2 , that the ship 's crew made a distress call to maritime officials
the revelation is likely to add to questions about the conduct of the crew , nine of whom are facing charges in last week 's sinking
among other things , authorities have questioned why an inexperienced third mate was guiding the ship at the time of the accident , why so few of the ferry 's life rafts were deployed and why crew members ordered passengers to don life vests and stay put
at least 146 people are confirmed dead , according to the joint task force leading the search
earlier , when the death toll was reported to be 128 , authorities had said that 174 people were still missing
the death toll had been expected to climb as divers were able to reach the ship 's cafeteria , where many passengers were thought to be when the ship began to have troubles last week
but early wednesday , the coast guard said no bodies had been found in the cafeteria
search for survivors goes on rescuers will continue to focus on the third and fourth decks of the five - level ship , said @entity66 , a spokesman for the joint task force
above the ship , two buoys marked its location in the water , surrounded by dozens of vessels , ranging from dinghies to warships
inflatable powerboats zipped across the sea , ferrying divers to the area
searchers used guide ropes to lead them into the submerged ferry
" divers ca n't even see their hands , " @entity66 said
@entity83 , one of the divers , said conditions are so bad " my heart aches
" " we 're going in thinking there may be survivors , " he said
" when we have to come back with nothing , we ca n't even face the families
" on shore , relatives of missing passengers waited anxiously , many of them parents of high school students who were on a field trip
as bodies come in , they are called into white domed tents to identify the remains of their loved ones
authorities said the efforts are still a search and rescue operation , but no survivors have been found since 174 people were rescued soon after the ferry went down
captain and crew criticized as the search continues , investigators are trying to figure out what happened to make the ship list before finally capsizing and sinking into the ocean
initial criticism has focused on the captain and some crew members
@entity1 president @entity119 said monday that their actions were " akin to murder
" the captain , @entity123 , has defended his decision to tell passengers to stay put as the ferry began sinking , saying he was concerned about the sea 's strong currents and cold water as well as the lack of rescue ships
questions have been raised about why the third mate was steering the ship when it ran into trouble on its way to a popular vacation island
the captain was in his cabin at the time
@entity140 , which operated the ferry , has posted an apology on its website
" we pray for the @entity6 victims who lost their precious lives due to the accident , " it said
" we prostrate ourselves before the victims ' families and beg for forgiveness
" in recent maritime disasters , captains did n't hang around students remember vice principal who took own life murky waters cloud the horror facing rescue divers @entity2 's @entity159 and @entity160 reported from @entity0 , and @entity2 's @entity161 reported and wrote from @entity162
@entity2 's @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , journalists @entity168 and @entity170 , and translator @entity171 also contributed to this report .
