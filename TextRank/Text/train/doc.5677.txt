-- @entity2 champions @entity1 opened their @entity4 title defense with a comfortable 3 - 1 victory over @entity6 in the @entity7 friday
it was very much business as usual for @entity1 in their first league match under new coach @entity10 once @entity11 had given them an early lead
just like in may 's @entity15 final win over arch - rivals @entity16 , it was @entity18 who set up @entity11 for the first goal , the @entity22 chipping goalkeeper @entity21
the 12th minute strike was the first of the @entity26 campaign and was quickly followed by a @entity28 goal
@entity29 hit the woodwork as @entity1 looked to move out of sight , but @entity34 defender @entity33 's own goal gave the visitors a lifeline just before the break
@entity1 were awarded two penalties in quick succession in the second half , both for handball against @entity42
@entity21 kept out @entity45 's first effort to keep his side a single goal adrift , but when a second spot kick was awarded almost straight away , he could not repeat the trick from @entity51 's 69th minute effort
@entity1 won the title by a record 25 points last season on the way to a treble as they added the @entity15 and @entity57 in @entity59 ' final season in charge
fomer @entity61 boss @entity10 took over in the summer and his first competitive match saw defeat to @entity16 in the @entity64 , but a @entity57 victory and three points in their league opener have followed
in @entity70 , the @entity69 campaign also began with the champions @entity71 in action at @entity73
they trailed to a 10th minute goal from @entity70 midfielder @entity76 , but @entity77 earned them a point with the equalizer on the hour mark
under new manager @entity86 after the departure of @entity83 to @entity84 and with icon @entity85 retired , @entity71 still kept new signing @entity87 on the bench from the start in the @entity91
@entity76 scored with a fierce shot after robbing @entity71 star striker @entity93 to give the home side the early advantage
@entity93 nearly made amends but his effort was parried away by @entity98 in the home goal
@entity34 @entity77 grabbed a share of the points as he netted after an @entity93 assist
@entity73 's @entity104 defender @entity103 was red carded with 18 minutes left but the home side held out
" we expected a better result , " @entity86 told @entity106
" but we created too little for my taste and made too many mistakes which allowed @entity73 to score
" big spending @entity111 open their campaign saturday at @entity115 , a former club of @entity86 , who led them to the title in 2009 .
