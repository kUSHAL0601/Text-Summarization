-- from luxury hotels in colossal tower blocks to traditional " ryokan " and functional capsule hotels , there 's plenty of variety in @entity9 's hotel scene
sample the salaryman lifestyle at the @entity11
if you can afford it -- and you probably ca n't -- you owe it to yourself to stay at the @entity15 ( 1 - 8 - 1 @entity16 , @entity17 )
as well as overlooking the @entity19 , what makes this hotel so special is the incredible array of high - tech mod cons in the rooms
there are wall panels that show the outdoor weather conditions , in - room nail dryers and espresso machines and , best of all , the toilets have a heated , self - lifting seat and built - in power deodorizer -- ingenious
another top - end option is the @entity34 ( 3 - 7 - 1 - 2 @entity35 ) , immediately recognizable as the setting for the movie " @entity38
" the hotel occupies floors 41 to 52 of the @entity41 , and with breathtaking views over the city and towards @entity46 , its popularity with visiting celebrities is understandable
a more economical option is the @entity9 ( @entity48 , 1 - 7 - 1 , @entity49 ) , which also has great views , along with modern , unfussy rooms
the hotel even employs " @entity54 " staff to make sure you get a good night 's sleep
@entity57 ( 1 - 6 - 30 @entity58 , @entity17 ) has comfortable rooms and is surprisingly luxurious for a business hotel
a " ryokan " is a traditional @entity62 - style inn , often featuring communal baths and rooms with futons and " tatami " ( straw mat ) flooring
they also tend to be cheaper than regular hotels
family - run @entity72 ( 2 - 3 - 11 @entity74 , @entity75 ) is cheap and homely
the @entity77 - speaking owner is exceptionally helpful and keen to immerse you in @entity62 culture
if you 're lucky , his family will put on a tea ceremony or lion dance for your viewing pleasure
@entity84 ( 1 - 31 - 11 @entity85 , @entity75 ) is a more expensive but more traditional option
most rooms have private bathrooms but it 's worth using the communal baths just for the views of the nearby five - storied pagoda
' @entity94 - style ' rooms are also available
if you 're on a tight budget , or just curious , you could always try a ' capsule ' hotel , where guests sleep in coffin - sized capsules , just big enough to sit up in
aimed primarily at workers too tired or too drunk to make it home , capsule hotels are only really suitable for single - night stays
@entity103 ( 2 - 20 - 4 @entity104 , @entity75 ) , with a women - only floor , is one of the few capsule hotels in @entity9 that allows female guests
you 'll be provided with a dressing gown and toothbrush and you 'll have access to communal bathing facilities
be sure to take earplugs , as the snores of drunken salarymen wo n't do much for your beauty sleep
where to stay what to see where to be seen where to eat where to shop ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
