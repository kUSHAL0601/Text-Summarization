@entity0 -- two popular anti-smoking drugs will now carry warnings about the risk of severe mental health problems , the @entity2 announced wednesday
" smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease , disability and death , " an @entity2 official said
the @entity2 said @entity13 and @entity14 will carry the warnings to alert consumers to the risks of depression and suicidal thoughts when using the drugs
the drugs also have been reported to cause changes in behavior , hostility and agitation in users , whether users had a history of psychiatric illness or not
in many cases , side effects started shortly after use began and ended when the medication was stopped
the @entity2 does not know what is causing the changes and said people taking these products should be monitored by their doctor
" the risk of serious adverse events while taking these products must be weighed against the significant health benefits of quitting smoking , " said dr. @entity37 , director of the @entity2 's @entity38
" smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease , disability and death in the @entity48 , and we know these products are effective aids in helping people quit
" the agency also is requiring @entity52 , which makes @entity13 , and @entity53 , maker of @entity14 , to conduct a study looking at how often these serious symptoms occur
@entity52 says it updated its label in 2007 to include information of neuropsychiatric symptoms and has revised the label again to reflect wednesday 's warning
" the labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about @entity13 and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely , " said dr. @entity62 , senior vice president of the primary care development group at @entity52
" quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for their health , but the quitting process is both difficult and complex
" the @entity2 says that since @entity13 was approved in 2006 , the agency has had reports of 98 suicides and 188 attempted suicides
@entity14 has had reports of 14 suicides and 17 attempts
@entity14 contains the same active ingredient as the antidepressant @entity14 and already carried a box warning about the increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior
neither @entity13 nor @entity14 contains nicotine , and the @entity2 said some symptoms could be the result of nicotine withdrawal
still , the agency said , people using these drugs experienced some of these symptoms while they were still smoking
in a review of side effects in patients using the nicotine patch , the agency said it did n't find a clear link between those products and suicidal events .
