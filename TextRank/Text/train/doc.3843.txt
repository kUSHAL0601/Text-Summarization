listening to the @entity1 , it sounds like an adventure movie -- the secret swapping of detained terror suspects for an ailing @entity6 soldier captured in @entity7
to @entity9 , it sounds like the same old same old -- the @entity1 ignoring an obligation to let legislators know about the deal ahead of time
in the aftermath of sgt. @entity16 's weekend release in exchange for five @entity19 figures held at @entity20 , @entity21 , some in @entity9 allege president @entity23 broke the law by failing to inform them about the move 30 days in advance -- as called for under the @entity28
" the law says they are to give us 30 days ' notice
if the president thought that was unconstitutional or an invalid law , than he should n't have signed the bill , " said @entity34 's @entity33 , the top @entity35 on the @entity36
" he knew very well that he was required by law to give us 30 days ' notice and he did n't do it
" @entity23 told reporters in @entity44 on tuesday that the circumstances required an immediate decision within his authority as commander in chief
" we saw an opportunity " " we have consulted with @entity9 for quite some time about the possibility we may have to execute a prisoner exchange , " @entity23 said of past talks involving @entity16
" we saw an opportunity and we were concerned about his health and had cooperation from the @entity56 and we seized that
it was truncated to make sure we did n't miss that opportunity
" the issue touches on flashpoints old and new between the administration and its critics , especially conservative republicans seeking to depict @entity23 as a weak leader driven by political concerns for his legacy
foremost is whether the @entity23 administration actually broke the law by not telling @entity9 beforehand about the weekend exchange in which @entity16 got handed over to @entity6 military commandos near the @entity7 - @entity74 border while the five alleged senior terrorism figures were flown to @entity56
under the @entity28 signed into law by @entity23 late last year , the administration gained some added flexibility in transferring detainees from @entity20 , but was required to notify @entity9 30 days in advance
however , legislators had no power to block such a transfer
writing about the law last year , @entity84 of the @entity85 said it put the administration " in a position to move detainees out of @entity20 as long as it is willing to be politically accountable for the problems they create and as long as they do n't bring them to the @entity6
" " it was lawful , " @entity1 says that is exactly what happened , @entity98 spokeswoman @entity97 argued tuesday in a statement
" given the credible reports regarding the risk of grave harm to sergeant @entity16 and the rapidly unfolding events surrounding his recovery , it was lawful for the administration to proceed with the transfer notwithstanding the notice requirement " in the @entity28 , @entity97 said in a statement
@entity113 legal analyst @entity112 disagreed , saying @entity23 " clearly broke the law " even if he can provide a legal justification for what he did
the bottom line , to @entity112 , was that the law calls for 30 days ' notice and @entity23 did n't do it
under the law , defense secretary @entity121 can authorize such a transfer if he " determines that actions have or will be taken that substantially mitigate the risk that the individual will engage in activity that threatens the @entity6 or @entity6 persons or interests , " or if the transfer " is in the national security interest of the @entity6 , " @entity97 said
in @entity44 , @entity23 noted tuesday that @entity56 provided assurances it would monitor the activities of the five @entity20 detainees , described as senior terrorist figures
under the terms of the exchange , the five released @entity19 figures ca n't leave @entity56 for a year
" we will be keeping eyes on them , " @entity23 said , noting the possibility existed the freed detainees would continue with terrorist activities but adding " i would n't be doing it if i thought that it was contrary to @entity6 national security
" even more , he contended , the move adhered to a bedrock @entity6 value of protecting its own
" regardless of the circumstances , whatever those circumstances may turn out to be , we still get an @entity6 soldier back if he 's held in captivity
full stop , " @entity23 said
" we do n't condition that , and that 's what every mom and dad who sees a son or daughter sent over to a war theater should expect from not just their commander in chief but the @entity6
" on the 30 - day notification period for @entity9 , @entity97 said the @entity23 administration determined that such a wait could scuttle the swap and perhaps cost @entity16 his life
conflicting responsibilities she provided a legal explanation , saying the @entity173 requires @entity23 as president and commander in chief to protect the lives of @entity6 abroad and protect @entity6 soldiers , responsibilities that in this case conflicted with the 30 - day notification period for @entity9
" we believe it is fair to conclude that @entity9 did not intend that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did in these circumstances , " she wrote
@entity97 also noted that in signing the @entity28 , @entity23 said the law " in certain circumstances would violate constitutional separation of powers principles
" " the executive branch must have the flexibility , among other things , to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers , " @entity97 quoted from @entity23 's signing statement
@entity112 said the signing statement amounts to the president 's opinion " of what the law should mean , " rather than a legal ruling
" this is an example of a signing statement where the president is taking power for himself that the law did n't give him , " @entity112 said
" that may be constitutional , but it is still a violation of what the law says
" to @entity9 , the exchange irritated an already raw nerve over the never - ending power struggle between the @entity1 and legislators , who accuse every administration of trying to run roughshod over congressional authority
even an @entity23 ally like @entity221 sen. @entity220 of @entity222 told @entity113 that as the chair of the @entity36 , she should have received some advance notice of the swap involving @entity20 detainees
on tuesday , @entity220 told reporters that the @entity1 deputy national security adviser , @entity228 , called her to apologize for the lack of advance notice
however , it was unclear from @entity220 's comments if @entity228 referred to a courtesy call or the 30 - day notification under the law
meanwhile , both @entity220 and @entity1 speaker @entity236 said the @entity1 encountered opposition from top @entity221 and @entity35 on congressional intelligence committees when it previously discussed the possibility of exchanging @entity16 for @entity20 detainees as far back as 2011
" given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed -- and these were from both committees and the leadership of both committees ; the concerns were bipartisan -- and i strongly believe that we should have been consulted , that the law should have been followed and i very much regret that that was not the case , " @entity220 said
@entity236 , an @entity251 @entity35 , also argued that the past discussions meant legislators expected the @entity23 administration to brief them again before any exchange took place , adding : " the only reason it did not is because the administration knew it faced serious and sober bipartisan concern and opposition
" however , another veteran @entity260 said the administration took all the proper steps under the circumstances
" we received a detailed classified notification from the secretary of defense that satisfies the many substantive certification requirements of the @entity28 , " said a statement by sen. @entity265 of @entity266 , who chairs the @entity267
noting that @entity23 " put @entity9 on notice " last december that he intended to act quickly in such cases , " members of @entity9 should not be surprised that he acted as he did in the circumstances that existed
" @entity35 attack strategy republicans piled on as part of their strategy to tarnish both the @entity23 and @entity221 brands ahead of november 's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote
some @entity35 committee chairmen in the @entity1 already plan for hearings on the legality of the swap , a move backed by @entity236
@entity33 , who is retiring when his current term expires at the end of the year , challenged the administration 's explanation that @entity294 's ill health necessitated moving swiftly to complete the weekend exchange
" there is no indication of that other than what this president said and i do n't believe a thing this president says now , " he said
veteran @entity35 sen. @entity303 of @entity304 took broader aim on tuesday , telling @entity306 that the @entity16 swap was part of what he called a misguided policy to get all @entity6 troops out of @entity7 by the end of 2016 -- a timetable @entity23 announced last week
" the president may be ending the war in @entity7 , but the @entity19 and @entity318 are not ending the war in @entity7 , " said @entity303 , a constant critic of any effort by @entity23 to limit @entity6 military presence abroad
@entity23 , who defeated @entity303 in the 2008 presidential election , " is carrying out a foreign policy of unreliability and weakness " that will cost the nation " for years to come , " said the senator , himself a former prisoner of war
@entity112 said he expected the controversy to remain in the political arena , noting that the courts rarely if ever get involved in power squabble between the executive and legislative branches
" this just shows that members of @entity9 , even @entity221 , are very jealous of institutional power , " he said , " and that @entity9 does n't want to be treated like a doormat , even by a president of the same party
" @entity23 defends prisoner exchange for @entity16 fellow soldiers call @entity16 a deserter , not a hero
