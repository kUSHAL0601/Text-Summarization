@entity0 -- evidence is growing that a retired @entity5 agent who disappeared in @entity6 four years ago is alive and being held in @entity7 , secretary of state @entity2 said thursday
@entity8 disappeared during a business trip in march 2007
" we have received recent indications that @entity14 is being held somewhere in southwest @entity7 , " @entity10 said in a statement
" as the government of @entity6 has previously offered its assistance in this matter , we respectfully request the @entity6 government to undertake humanitarian efforts to safely return and reunite @entity14 with his family
" @entity21 checked into a @entity23 hotel and attended meetings on march 8 , 2007
he checked out the following day , but did not make a scheduled flight to @entity27
in recent months , the @entity28 received " proof of life , " according to a senior diplomatic official and a @entity28 government official
both requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation
the government official told @entity1 the evidence was received within the last six months and is " clear and convincing proof that @entity8 is alive
" the government official would not elaborate on what the " convincing " evidence entailed
its emergence has fueled a fresh round of " discussions " between the @entity28 and @entity6 , according to the senior diplomatic official
the discussions , not equivalent to negotiations , were described as " working level , " meaning it was not conducted by senior administration officials , the official said
the @entity28 is awaiting action by @entity6 and is hopeful progress is being made , the official said
@entity8 's wife , @entity55 , said her seven children , two grandchildren and she " await the day we will be reunited
" " our family is tremendously encouraged by the news @entity14 is alive but remains concerned for his safety and well being , " she said in a statement thursday
@entity8 suffers from diabetes and requires regular medication , she said
@entity21 's family told @entity1 in 2010 he was working as a private investigator in @entity27 and may have been looking into a cigarette smuggling case
@entity21 family members have met with local @entity6 officials and have traveled there to retrace his steps
@entity21 flew to the @entity71 in 2008 to ask questions about her husband
@entity6 president @entity74 declined to meet her
the family has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to his safe return
the @entity79 and @entity5 have consistently denied @entity21 was working for the government and have demanded @entity6 free @entity21 -- if it is holding him
@entity6 has insisted it does not know his whereabouts
the @entity28 has lacked reliable information about whether @entity21 was alive or dead
in the first few years after his disappearnace , @entity86 administration officials had said they suspect @entity6 authorities seized @entity21 and were holding him in a jail inside the country
but as the years since his appearance passed , many officials believed he might be dead
@entity21 is a retired @entity5 agent from @entity97 , @entity98
after leaving the agency , his wife says , he worked as a security consultant specializing in cigarette smuggling
the @entity79 has repeatedly met with @entity21 's family and have sent diplomatics note to @entity106 through the @entity108 government , who represents the @entity28 interests in @entity6 in the absence of an @entity28 diplomatic presence in the country
@entity1 had reported that @entity21 met with @entity114 , an @entity28 fugitive who lives in @entity6 , shortly before his disappearance
@entity114 -- known in @entity6 as @entity114 -- converted to @entity116 and was given refugee status in @entity6 after admitting in interviews to killing @entity119 , a former @entity6 diplomat under the shah , in @entity121 in 1980 , he told @entity1 in a 2007 interview
@entity114 was detained by @entity6 officials in plain clothes and taken away from the room he shared with @entity21 to be interrogated about his @entity6 passport , he said in the interview
when he was freed the next day , he said , he was told by officials that @entity21 had returned to @entity27
senior administration officials have told @entity1 that they believe @entity114 met with @entity21 , but do not believe him to be a credible source of information on @entity21 's whereabouts
in 2009 , secretary of state @entity2 personally passed a note to @entity6 officials at a @entity71 conference on @entity135 in the @entity136 asking them for help in finding @entity21
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity138 said thursday the agency could not comment further
" we are working very hard to bring @entity8 home safely , " @entity138 said
" his family misses him dearly and we remain concerned about his heath , given history of diabetes
" sen. @entity146 of @entity98 has sought information for the @entity21 family for the past four years
" it 's encouraging that we may have good news , " @entity146 said in a statement later thursday
" i 'm praying that he can be reunited with his family
" " it 's encouraging that we may have good news
i 'm praying that he can be reunited with his family
" @entity156 reported from @entity0 and @entity157 reported from @entity158
