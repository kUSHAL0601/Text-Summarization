-- @entity2 fans were delighted monday to learn that they could download her new album , @entity4 , from @entity5 for a mere $ 0.99 -- until , of course , technical difficulties set in
downloads of the album are delayed , leaving folks unable to get the entire album immediately upon purchase
@entity5 issued the following statement : " @entity5 is experiencing high volume and downloads are delayed
if customers order today , they will get the full @entity2 , @entity4 album for $ 0.99
" however , the damage has already been done , as users are meting out one - star ratings in droves , most of which deal with @entity5 's slow service as opposed to the quality of the music ( although some reviews in the lower bracket did dub the disc " disappointing " )
as a result , the album has a relatively low three - star rating
reviews of the following nature reign : " this review is n't a review of the album , but of the @entity5 's digital music service
i tried this as an experiment to see if i wanted to order more music this way , but it only downloaded half the songs
still a deal at 99 cents , but not an experiment i 'll want to repeat with a full - price album
" many reviews also trumpet the user 's intent to buy from @entity55 in the future , instead of @entity5 -- a state of affairs @entity5 would want to avoid , considering @entity55 already holds most of the market share for digital music
this backlash does not bode well for the future popularity of @entity5 's new cloud player service , which the company was touting in the promotional language of the deal , offering users more storage space for buying the album
