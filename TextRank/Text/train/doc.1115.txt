update from the social network that was first reported on sunday night , which it 's calling the @entity6
the " @entity6 " was front - and - center with @entity3 's controversial redesign earlier this year
it 's the first major implementation of an emerging ( read : brand new ) open standard called @entity14 , on which @entity3 has been collaborating with developers for the past few months
basically , what it means is that third - party developers will have access to a feed of all content posted to news feeds -- notes , photos , videos , links , " likes " and comments , and activity from other applications built on the social network 's platform
" we 've officially moved away from the web of just blog posts , which a lot of these formats were originally designed for , " said open - source developer and advocate @entity34 , who has been spearheading the development of @entity14 for about a year now
" over time , what i think will happen is ( that ) you 'll see something toward the type of cleverness and ingenuity that has surfaced around the @entity48 community , but in a way that is even more expressive and rich , " @entity34 said
" in the case of @entity48 , you 're just talking about status updates ; in the case of @entity3 you 're talking about a lot of different activities
" previously , only status updates -- the most @entity48 - like part of @entity3 -- were accessible to developers
that 's why this announcement likely makes the biggest difference to the creators of social feed aggregation applications like @entity63 and @entity64
but because @entity14 is an open standard , other social - networking and media - sharing applications will be able to use it too
this means that there could be , say , an @entity72 - based desktop application that brings in updates across photo - sharing applications like @entity3 , @entity75 , and @entity76
@entity3 is also targeting different types of developers -- specifically mobile and desktop -- rather than strictly the web app developers whose creations made @entity3 's platform such a wild success when it debuted two years ago
" one of the most important stories to tell here is this is the first time that we 've ever opened the core @entity3 product experience , which was previously called the ' feed ' and which we 're now calling the ' stream , ' " @entity3 senior platform manager @entity84 explained to @entity0
" we 're especially excited to see the types of desktop applications and the types of mobile applications which developer are going to build for the stream
we 've sort of never really allowed this before , so we 're pretty excited to see what developers come up with
" @entity3 will be holding an event on monday afternoon in @entity102 , @entity103 , to introduce developers to the new api
presenting at the event will be representatives from @entity107 , which is building a @entity3 application in its air runtime environment , and @entity110 , which is doing the same in @entity112 ; contact management system @entity113 and third - party app @entity64 ( which already has unveiled its support for the @entity6 ) are also presenting
the " stream " took front - and - center with @entity3 's controversial redesign earlier this year
inspired by the likes of @entity48 , the revamped design marked a shift in strategy for @entity3 from static profiles to a real - time flow of information
at the same time , it proved unpopular among some users
but @entity3 is n't the only big social - networking player to be implementing @entity14
the emerging standard was behind the upgrades to @entity134 's @entity133 product that the @entity136 - owned service launched in march at the @entity137
" it was sort of one of the earlier opportunities we had to take a nascent spec and see it all the way through to launch , " @entity133 product lead @entity138 told @entity0 , adding that his team first started working on @entity14 last september
it 's what powers a new @entity134 " gadget " for @entity151 as well as its feeds ' presence on the upcoming @entity155 homepage redesign
" it 's getting where we need it to be , which is like e-mail : where you can write a @entity165 client and know ( that ) it works , " @entity138 said
" it 's not even a full standard yet , so it 's sort of exciting to see so many people get behind something so quickly , and it 's definitely indicative of the general momentum of people who are saying we 'd rather work open than work closed
