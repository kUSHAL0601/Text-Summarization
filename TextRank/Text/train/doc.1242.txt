-- defense or attack ? is there a preferred way to clinch the @entity6 title ? @entity7 and @entity8 , the two title rivals in action saturday , displayed opposing tactics as both recorded victories
anxious @entity7 fans had to wait for the @entity14 club to beat rivals @entity15 and hang onto their @entity6 lead by a single point from @entity8
@entity19 midfielder @entity18 struck twice in quick succession in the second half to seal a 2 - 0 win for @entity24 's side
but the @entity7 manager was quick to praise the defensive bedrock of the team , which had done well to deny @entity28 and @entity29 in the first half and @entity31 late on
" that stability is vital to us , " @entity24 told @entity32 after the match
" we were seriously defensive for 90 minutes today
" it was a different story further north in @entity39 where free - scoring @entity8 raced to a 4 - 2 victory over @entity41
@entity42 scored @entity8 's 100th goal of the season -- a neat feat so early in the campaign -- as he opened the scoring with 14 minutes on the clock
the bobbling goal was verified by goal - line technology , making its debut in the @entity6 this season , as an electronic signal sent to referee @entity55 's watch confirmed the ball had crossed the line
although @entity41 pulled back a surprise equaliser thanks to @entity59 , @entity8 were undeterred and @entity60 soon nosed them back in front
in the second half , @entity62 and the returning @entity63 linked up to help each other score and put the game beyond @entity41
@entity8 's attacking game had done enough to keep the 2011/2012 @entity6 champions snapping at @entity7 's ankles but manager @entity70 felt his side deserved more
" the score does not reflect the match , " he told @entity32
" it was one of the matches where we missed more chances to score
" it 's very important to score 100 [ goals ] because this moment in the season the team has a clear style of play and we continue exactly what we 're doing so far
" @entity87 , third in the table , invite defending champions @entity90 to @entity91 on sunday when @entity92 also host @entity93
this season the @entity6 is fiercely competitive not only at the top of the table but throughout the swathe of 20 teams
the bottom 10 teams are separated by just five points
a late 1 - 0 victory for @entity101 against @entity102 helped the south @entity14 club move up to 16th while struggling @entity104 also scored late on to salvage a 2 - 2 draw against @entity106
@entity107 were on the move in the @entity109 as they drilled five goals past bottom club @entity111 to join @entity112 and @entity113 at the top of the table on 50 points
@entity117 proved why he was picked to receive the prestigious @entity118 this week as he set @entity111 on their way with a stylish long range strike
@entity121 sailed in a free - kick for 2 - 0 before @entity123 hit home his 100th goal for @entity112
@entity125 and @entity126 rounded off the scoring in the second half
" @entity117 , @entity121 and @entity123 were very effective , " coach @entity129 told reporters
" the whole team gave them a lot of chances to score because we played quickly up front
" this match was important because we were trying to get into first place
it may only be for one night , but we 'll sleep well tonight
" @entity113 and @entity112 have a chance to pull clear sunday when they return to domestic action
in @entity142 , @entity141 pulled eight points clear of rivals @entity144 at the top of the table as they ticked off their 12th straight @entity148 win saturday
@entity149 scored twice -- once from the penalty spot after he had been brought down in the box -- while @entity152 and @entity153 also found the net to seal a 4 - 2 win over a dogged @entity157 side
earlier , @entity144 had beaten @entity158 3 - 0 to send them back to the bottom of @entity148
