@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's supreme leader is attempting to extinguish an annual event celebrating the last days of winter and the @entity7 calendar year , and the government is strengthening its security presence in the days leading up to a major holiday , @entity1 media reported
ayatollah @entity11 on sunday urged @entity1 to dismiss the ancient practice of fire jumping and feasting on @entity14 , a festival held on the eve of the last wednesday before spring -- this year , march 16
the activities date back thousands of years
the festivities have no basis in @entity20 , and can cause " harm and corruption , " @entity11 said in a statement published by @entity1 news sites
" it is appropriate to avoid it , " he said
the celebrations lead up to @entity28 , the holiday that marks the first day of spring and the @entity7 new year
@entity28 falls on saturday this year
@entity1 is beefing up security to ensure " order and calm " during the two - week period celebrating @entity28 , stationing 200,000 security personnel across the @entity20 republic , according to @entity36 news , the official new site of @entity1 president @entity38
in the eastern city of @entity41 , the chief prosecutor said those who engage in " disruptive behavior " during @entity14 would face " strong consequences
" it 's a precaution that 's become increasingly commonplace in @entity1 , especially in advance of holidays , as the government continues to warn against political demonstrations that have emerged since last summer 's disputed presidential elections
most recently , the @entity1 government quashed anti-government protests that brewed in february as the nation commemorated the 31st anniversary of the @entity55 , which marked the end of the country 's @entity58 - backed monarchy and the start of an @entity20 republic
in the days that led up to the february 11 holiday , the government mobilized security forces and heightened its warnings , saying it would arrest protesters and hold them until the april 9 end of @entity28
six protesters who were arrested in december on the @entity20 holiday of @entity71 were sentenced to death on monday , the day before @entity14 , the semi-official @entity68 news agency reported monday
their sentences are being reviewed by an appeals court , @entity68 said
and some 350 inmates at @entity76 have gone on hunger strike to demand that their cases be examined before @entity28 , saying their ward is so overcrowded with recent political arrestees that prisoners are in poor health , according to the @entity83 , an @entity1 group
there were also reports that opposition leader @entity86 's home was vandalized
@entity86 's @entity90 ( @entity89 ) party 's web site , called @entity91 , said a group had gathered in front of his house and tossed red paint on the walls of the apartment building
two weeks earlier , a similar group threw tomatoes and eggs at the building , the web site said
a video identifying a vandalized apartment building as @entity86 's was posted on @entity106 monday , showing exterior walls scrawled with the last names of @entity86 , fellow opposition leader @entity110 and former president @entity111 -- all reformists
in some areas , the black spray paint read " death to @entity86 " and " death to @entity111
" anti-government demonstrations began after the disputed june 12 presidential vote , which re-elected hardline president @entity38 over main opposition candidate @entity110
eyewitnesses in @entity1 said thousands of riot police and security officers lined the streets of the capital , @entity0 , and patrolled major intersections on motorcycles and on foot monday night
beginning saturday , police also set up checkpoints along major roads in @entity0 , and vehicles have been stopped and searched from late at night into the early morning hours , witnesses said
@entity2 's @entity132 contributed to this report .
