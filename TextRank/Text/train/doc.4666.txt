@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 planned flogging for a @entity5 blogger was not carried out friday -- the third straight week that a scheduled set of 50 lashes was postponed after he endured wounds in an initial set in the conservative kingdom -- his sister told @entity1
the reason why @entity14 received another reprieve friday was n't immediately available , but previous postponements were made because doctors determined he was too badly injured in his first beating january 9 to withstand more , according to @entity20 and his wife
the case of @entity14 , who was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after a @entity2 court convicted him of insulting @entity28 , has garnered international headlines and global outrage
@entity14 started a blog called " @entity32 " in 2008 to encourage discussion about @entity28 , particularly the intrusion of the nation 's religious police in @entity5 ' personal lives
he was officially charged with " adopting liberal thought , " " founding a liberal website , " and insulting @entity28 , and was convicted of the latter
@entity14 received his first 50 lashes on january 9 and was taken back to prison
he was n't flogged as scheduled in subsequent weeks , including this friday , his sister , @entity43 , said
@entity44 , deputy director of @entity20 's @entity46 and @entity47 program , said last week that @entity5 authorities should " publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally , " rather than assess his fitness to be flogged week by week
" @entity14 is still at risk
there is no way of knowing whether the @entity5 authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead , " @entity44 said last week
