, have expressed their concern at the financial situation surrounding @entity8 's @entity7 team
@entity8 ( fourth left ) and his team - mates could be riding for a new sponsor if the team 's money problems continue
the team , which apart from @entity8 has a number of high - profile riders including current @entity16 and @entity18 champion @entity17 and top @entity20 @entity19 , is financially supported by a consortium of @entity23 - based companies
however , with the global recession continuing to bite , the @entity23 cycling federation has already been forced to overcome a shortfall in riders ' salaries this year
this comes amid reports that the team 's sponsors are reluctant to commit further , a situation that could lead to the @entity1 to withdraw @entity7 's professional racing licence
@entity1 president @entity35 will travel to the city of @entity7 , the @entity23 capital , later this month to discuss the matter and try to find a resolution
" he ( @entity35 ) will take the opportunity to talk about that , because we are concerned , " @entity40 , the @entity1 's chief press officer , told @entity41
@entity7 are among the starters for this year 's @entity16 , which begins in @entity46 on saturday , but doubts remain whether the team will appear in the same guise for the @entity50 , which begins in @entity51 on july 4
a team spokesman was adamant the issue can be resolved
" for the moment , there is no problem
if the sponsors pay again , nothing is lost
" if the sponsors fail to stump up the required revenue , team chief @entity62 , who mentored @entity8 to all seven of his @entity65 victories , could have a number of options which should see them able to continue , including finding another title sponsor
cancer survivor @entity8 returned to cycling this year , after a three - year absence , to promote his @entity72 campaign and the battle against the illness
the 37 - year - old @entity20 is immune to @entity7 's financial plight as he does not receive a salary from the team , relying on his long - term sponsors such as @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81
because of @entity8 's unique situation within the team there is also the possibility that the @entity20 could take over sponsorship himself , to further promote the @entity87 campaign , or have the necessary contacts to bring in another major sponsor .
