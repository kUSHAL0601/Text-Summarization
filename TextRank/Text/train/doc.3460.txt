the @entity0 is in town and with it comes sacred flames , security bans , street protests and a bizarre front page depiction of world leaders in various states of undress
the @entity10 city of @entity11 arguably has n't seen this much excitement since @entity13 transformed a derelict strip of industrial land into a sprawling souvenir shop and later an inner city beach
preparations have been underway for more than two years , since ex-prime minister @entity21 's former @entity20 government proposed the city as a venue for the world 's largest and most influential economic talks
current prime minister @entity26 has sworn that this @entity0 " will not be a talkfest
" still , over the next few days , political pundits will be scrutinizing the words , actions and gestures of at least 25 world leaders for hints at future policy
while they do , here are few lesser - known facts about @entity11 's @entity0
there 's a sacred ceremonial fire at least , we hope there is
last week , firefighters responded to a 000 call -- @entity10 's version of 911 -- to report an open fire in the city 's @entity45 near the @entity0 center
officers duly put it out , only to be confronted by angry @entity51 elders of the @entity53 tribe who had lit the sacred ceremonial flame for @entity0 , according to @entity57 reporter @entity56
" they accosted the firefighters , yelling at them , a fair bit of swearing , accusing them of deliberately attempting to extinguish the fire as they knew that it was their sacred fire , " @entity56 told @entity58
the embers used to light the blaze came from the fire burning at the @entity67 in @entity68 , the headquarters of a long campaign for recognition and compensation for the theft of @entity51 land
during a march through the city on monday , activists stopped in the middle of the street and broke into traditional dance , @entity56 said
more protests are planned during @entity0
banned : eggs , stones , insects if you thought about taking your lizard for a walk through inner city @entity11 this week think again
" a reptile , insect , or other animal capable of causing physical harm if released in close proximity to a person " are banned from key areas of the city , according to the government 's @entity0 security law
you ca n't carry an egg , stone , metal cans , tins or glass bottles , and especially not ones that contain urine or manure , which are also on the banned list
of course , crossbows are out and it would be best to leave your whips at home
step away from the mayonnaise the threat of terrorism may be on the minds of police chiefs , but the state 's top doctor has said she 's more worried about egg mayonnaise
local caterers are expecting to prepare around 100,000 meals for delegates , media and police over the two - day event , creating a potential @entity125 minefield
" we 've seen quite a few outbreaks in @entity128 over the last few years , mainly due to raw eggs , " dr. @entity126 told the @entity10
" my personal view is we should all shy away from raw egg mayonnaise at all times , " she said
cheese please @entity134 president @entity133 is known to love a cheese burger , which is presumably why @entity137 's @entity136 has created the @entity138
either that or they fancied some free publicity
the towering burger includes two @entity143 beef patties , cheese ( of course ) , onions , onion rings , spinach , tomato , cucumbers and mustard
fans of local burger delicacies , beetroot and pineapple , will have to look elsewhere
mind the signs a row has erupted over signs at @entity137 , which would have been some of the first images delegates saw as they make their way through arrivals
the rejected slogans , submitted by @entity165 20 ( @entity166 ) and @entity167 included : " if corruption was an industry it would be the world 's third largest
" and " women comprise 70 % of the world 's poor
" @entity137 tweeted : " we do n't accept any political ads , whether from parties , cause based organizations or individuals , regardless of issue / message
" @entity166 spokesman @entity181 said : " it 's a sad day for @entity10 if talking about inequality , climate change or corruption are deemed too political
" the airport is offering a billboard of world leaders to satisfy demands for selfies
still at the airport ... possibly the people most excited about @entity0 right now are about 120 plane spotters who are at @entity137 eagerly awaiting the arrival of planes never before seen the country
" the mood is excellent
people are excited about these aircraft visiting and how it puts @entity11 on the map in a global sense , " @entity199 from @entity200 told @entity58
" some of these aircraft will probably never visit @entity11 again so it really is a one in a lifetime opportunity for aviation photographers
" the most anticipated touchdowns are president @entity210 's @entity209 and @entity133 's @entity211
" everyone 's hoping for @entity211 but it probably wo n't happen , " plane spotter @entity212 told the @entity57
" i 'd be ecstatic
that would be the pinnacle of everything
