in june of 1960 , my father was a 14 - year - old @entity3 boy with a round - trip airline ticket from @entity5 to @entity6 , @entity7
he spent the summer with family in @entity7 while @entity3 fell deeper and deeper into @entity10 's revolution
he did n't realize the extent to which his life back home was quickly crumbling and that the winds of revolution were about to change his life forever
at the end of that summer , my grandfather told his son that he would not be coming home ; that he should stay in @entity7 and wait for the rest of the family to join him
it was a long wait
it would take my grandfather more than 10 years to get out of @entity3
i 've always wondered if that summer vacation was part of my grandfather 's plan to make sure that my father would not be trapped in socialist @entity3
maybe if my father had known he was n't coming back home , he would have put up a fight to stay in @entity5
my mother recently found that unused airline ticket sitting in a box of my father 's things
the ticket to a flight that never happened is a heartbreaking slice of family history still frozen in time
for many @entity43 , the reaction to the news that the @entity43 and @entity3 have announced plans to normalize relations was , " it 's about time
" for many @entity43 , @entity3 is nothing more than a forbidden playground with cigars , rum , beautiful beaches and baseball players
they want to experience a taste of this island trapped in time
they want to see the classic @entity43 cars rolling through the streets of @entity5
to the families of @entity3 exiles , the island is much more
it 's a complex and sad reality
@entity3 is not a novelty or an unchecked box on a bucket list
@entity3 is the rhythmic heartbeat of a life lost long ago but still beating in our souls
@entity10 's revolution split my family apart like so many others
i still have extended family in @entity3
i 've had only a few chances to spend time with them
( i 've worked as a journalist twice in @entity3 , covering @entity77 's visit in 1998 and former president @entity79 's visit in 2002
) i 'm the only person in my family who has traveled to @entity3 since most of my family left
all my life , i 've wondered if this historic moment would ever come in my lifetime
in my mind , it was supposed to be a moment like the @entity87 coming down ; a highly anticipated event the world would watch together
but instead , the news seemed to come out of thin air on the week before @entity92
unexpected and unpredictable , that 's the way it always seems to be with @entity3
hard times for ordinary @entity3 with normalized relations , many people want to see a boom of foreign investment , led by @entity43 flocking to a place that 's been locked behind the gates of the @entity102 for more than 50 years
but i ask you to understand , as best as i can explain , the fear and apprehension this news means to many @entity3 exiles
people often tell me that they 'd love to travel to @entity3 because it seems like such a fun place
i tell them of my uncle who , well into his old age , would wake up at 4 in the morning to get in line for a ration of bread
i remember the first time i visited @entity3 , i watched my uncle come home with a piece of bread that had more in common with a hockey puck
i could n't believe that my elderly uncle would wake up every morning to stand in line for that
people often tell me they want to walk the streets of @entity5 and see the crumbling buildings
i tell them of the countless young girls who work as " jineteras " -- slang for @entity3 prostitutes -- to help earn money for their families who live crammed inside those walls
it 's sickening to think that so many men from around the world come to @entity3 for just this reason
these are the kinds of things @entity3 exile families think about when they think of @entity3
there 's a very privileged class in @entity3
the families of those in power live a life that rivals that of the most comfortable @entity43
so when @entity3 exiles hear of normalizing relations , they worry that it 's @entity3 's privileged class that will benefit the most at the expense of ordinary @entity3
fear that the status quo will prevail many @entity3 exiles feel that the @entity10 regime has won the war for more than 50 years and that normalizing relations is another victory for a corrupt and evil dictatorship
" they always win " is a common sentiment among @entity3 exiles who have such a distrust of the @entity10 regime
many exiles fear a wrong move will provide another victory for a dictatorship that took so much from them
for more than 50 years , @entity3 's story has surprised and saddened many exiles and their families , and we ca n't help but fear history will repeat itself
we see family and friends left behind on the island who 've spent decades fighting and scraping for the most meager of lives
" no es facil , " said president @entity176 , the @entity178 phrase often used to describe life in @entity3
it translates to life " is not easy
" and that 's putting it mildly
perhaps it 's inevitable that @entity43 and other foreign investment will swoop into @entity3 one day
maybe it 's just a matter of time before a @entity190 's restaurant sits on the @entity191 , @entity5 's famous oceanfront boulevard just 90 miles from @entity192
or maybe @entity43 will rush in to buy up oceanfront property with amazing views on the most beautiful beaches of @entity3
but i ask you this : what kind of view will ordinary @entity3 get ? my father did n't live long enough to see this moment
my grandparents are n't here to see it either
and most in my family have mixed emotions about what this will really mean
this @entity92 , we 'll argue about it over black beans and rice and roasted pork
the children of @entity3 exiles , like me , all dream of walking the streets of @entity3 with our parents and grandparents to finally feel that rhythmic beat of our @entity3 soul that still sits in our hearts .
