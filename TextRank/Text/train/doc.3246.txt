-- @entity1 clinched their first @entity3 title since 2004 on saturday night as they drew 0 - 0 with @entity4 at the @entity5
the draw means that @entity1 now have an unassailable nine - point lead at the top of the table
even if @entity12 managed to finish level on points , @entity1 's superior head - to - head record against them this season means they can not be beaten
the league title -- the club 's 18th in total -- brings to an end a period of dominance by their city rivals who have won the last five league titles in @entity24
" we gave a lot all year long to get here and we deserve to win
i 'm lucky because the president ( @entity30 ) gave us the opportunity ( with new signings ) to get important results , " @entity1 coach @entity29 said , @entity28 reported
winning the title has also proved the doubters wrong who said his team was too old , @entity29 said
" we won 23 out of 36 games and proved that we deserved it , " @entity29 said , @entity28 reported
@entity1 's vice-captain @entity39 was full of praise for his coach
" @entity29 deserves a 10 out of 10 , he was the architect of this success , he managed to keep the group compact , " @entity42 said , @entity28 reported
only needing a draw to ensure the title , @entity1 , understandably , played conservatively throughout the 90 minutes , doing what was necessary to see them over the finishing line
few clear - cut chances fell to either team in the first half , but @entity4 's @entity53 striker @entity52 went close with a volley in the 14th minute which forced @entity55 into a smothering save
@entity57 went close for @entity1 early in the second half with a curling shot which hit the post and @entity61 shot narrowly wide on the hour mark
@entity4 became more adventurous as the game wore on but offered little to really trouble the new champions and at the final whistle , @entity1 were comfortably in control -- much like they have been all season .
