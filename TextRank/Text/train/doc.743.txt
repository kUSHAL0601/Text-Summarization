@entity1 , @entity0 -- the case of @entity5 athlete @entity4 has sparked worldwide interest following reports that she will be tested by sporting officials to determine whether she is male or female
@entity4 celebrates her gold , which came just hours after the @entity11 called for a gender test on the athlete
the 18 - year - old won gold in the 800 meters race wednesday but she may be forced to return the medal if she fails a gender - verification test imposed by the @entity11 ( @entity11 )
according to media reports , the @entity11 are testing to see whether @entity4 has a rare genetic disorder that means she has female genitalia but male chromosomes
this condition , known as intersex , is commonly referred to as hermaphroditism
( some support groups say that the term " hermaphroditism " can be inaccurate and offensive , as it implies that someone is both fully male and fully female , which is a physiologic impossibility
) according to the @entity32 , ( @entity32 ) intersex is a " general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that does n't seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male
" " for example , a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside , but having mostly male - typical anatomy on the inside , " a statement on the society 's web site says
there are around 20 to 30 types of biological " intersex " conditions , each of them affecting the body in different ways
some people are born with both male and female reproductive organs , while others like intersex activist @entity60 are born biologically female yet possess masculine - looking genitalia
others have a form known as @entity63 ( @entity63 ) where the person is totally insensitive to any male hormones known as androgens
dr. @entity67 of the @entity69 's @entity68 told @entity2 : " @entity70 is incredibly rare , the one i 've seen most commonly and one which affects 1 in 13,000 people worldwide is @entity63
" " in a woman your androgen receptors leads you to grow pubic hair , for instance , " he explained
" if you are insensitive to androgens , you will grow up looking like a girl because the default of all human beings is female
" however if the body , when it 's developing , is not guided into turning into a male , then it will always be female , " he told @entity2
he added : " this @entity5 athlete could n't have @entity63 because her problem is that it is suggested that she looks rather male , she 's got a big jaw and has very little breast development , but so many athletes are like that , " he added
" but if she had @entity63 she would be all female and would n't have the advantage of the testosterone androgen , which make men 's bones grow and makes them faster than a woman
" to test @entity4 's gender , dr. @entity67 said the @entity11 test would involve her being examined by a gynecologist to see what her genitals look like
@entity4 would also have an ultrasound to see if she has all the normal female reproductive organs
doctors would also need an hormonal test to see if she had an excess of testosterone and they would also test her chromosomes
people who are intersex could also have the condition and not be aware of it , as was the case of @entity118 athlete @entity117 , who failed a gender test at the @entity120 and was stripped of her medal
she later attempted suicide , survived and recently announced she was becoming a coach
intersex conditions occur in one out of every 2,000 births in the @entity126 , according to the @entity127 , @entity128 - based @entity32
for more than half a century it was common for doctors to carry out reversal operations , either through castration or constructing a new vagina , on babies whose genitals were seen as either too big or too small
many of these people later spoke out and said that these surgeries caused them trauma and confusion in adult life
most groups campaigning for intersex people now advocate that doctors should not perform medically unnecessary genital surgeries on intersex babies to make them male or female
