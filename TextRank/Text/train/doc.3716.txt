-- a new invasion of pyrotechnics and full - body costumes will assault @entity1 this weekend , as the 2014 @entity5 signs off with a third sell - out date at @entity7
more than any previous tour , this series has delivered on the league 's grand ambition to embed itself in the public imagination overseas
backed by feverish hype and a willing host government , @entity5 chiefs are confidently predicting a permanent franchise in @entity1 within a few years
as the party gets started ahead of @entity20 vs. @entity21 on sunday , events will be closely followed by @entity22 , the all - powerful chief executive of @entity24 's @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , who would dearly love to take the ' other ' football on tour , sending @entity27 and @entity28 over to entertain the locals in @entity30 or @entity31
@entity22 , credited with much of the league 's vast commercial success since his appointment in 1999 , first raised the idea of adding an extra , overseas fixture -- the " 39th game " - to the calendar in 2008
that proposal was swiftly shot down but , in august , @entity22 maintained : " it will happen at some point
" at an informal meeting in october , @entity23 officials discussed the possibility of a single round of fixtures from the existing schedule being taken abroad as early as the 2016 - 17 season
it is easy to see the appeal
the league is the most popular domestic sporting product in the world , with a vast global audience worth over £ 650 million ( $ 1.04 billion ) each year in international tv rights
overseas friendlies have also been richly rewarded , with @entity27 earning £ 8 million ( $ 12.8 million ) over three matches in the @entity58 last summer
one of these , a 3 - 1 win over @entity60 in @entity61 , broke the @entity58 attendance record for the sport with a crowd of 109 , 318 at the " @entity65
" the @entity23 's competitors are looking abroad to find ways of closing the gap
@entity70 's @entity69 has international tv rights worth just £ 146 ( $ 234 million ) million each year , but already plays its @entity73 match abroad
past locations include @entity75 and the @entity58 , with the next edition set to be held in @entity77
@entity79 president @entity78 is keen for league fixtures to follow
such expansion is a strategic goal for owners of @entity24 team , says @entity85 , a football consultant who advised the country 's @entity86 on the creation of the @entity23
" the majority of clubs are foreign owned , and it 's a natural step for them , " says @entity85 " the @entity23 is no longer an @entity24 league , it 's an international league that happens to played in @entity24
if that 's the case why not play it abroad ? that 's the owners ' thinking
" if clubs are the driving force for the proposed changes , they have been reluctant to say so
@entity100 vice-chairman @entity99 has said she " likes the idea , " and @entity102 chairman @entity101 has said matches abroad are " inevitable "
but a spokesman for the @entity107 club later claimed that @entity101 had been misquoted , while @entity100 , along with most clubs , will not discuss the matter until they see a formal proposal
the caution has been conditioned by fierce and unanimous hostility from supporters
the 2008 proposal was killed off in little over a week by sustained campaigning from fan groups , including lobbying international authorities and nationwide protests
the response this time has been just as emphatic , with every supporter trust rapidly issuing a condemnation of the plans
" the first issue is competitive integrity , " says @entity124 of the @entity125
" half the teams would lose a home game and the normal advantage of that
" @entity124 lists concerns over when the games abroad would be played -- potentially at a crucial stage of the season -- as well as the dramatically different conditions they could be played under , and which games were chosen
" not all games are going to be attractive to foreign audiences so would they engineer the draw , or make it purely at random ? say you play @entity143 's home match with @entity27 in @entity144 -- their home fans are losing the most attractive game of the season
" research from supporter trusts with their overseas branches in @entity150 revealed that few were keen on league games in their countries , with a popular response being that the setting of famous stadiums like @entity157 or @entity158 is an integral part of the appeal
activists believe this supports a business argument for keeping clubs in @entity24
" our argument is that what makes the premier league so effective at generating sales overseas is not just what 's on the pitch -- @entity175 and @entity176 have been more successful lately , " says @entity171 , chief executive of the @entity172 , which represents fans across the country
" @entity22 and the league are very aware that when it comes to overseas sales , atmosphere and tradition are crucial to what they were selling , and give them the edge
i think they jeopardize that at their peril
" despite recent progress , the @entity5 still highlights the challenge of exporting passion for teams outside the @entity58 , believes @entity194 , former lineman for the @entity195 , academic and author of several books on the business of the sport
" i 've long believed that marketing the @entity5 overseas would struggle , because my sense of team sports is that they are locally rooted , " says @entity194
" @entity202 has its football , ours is alien there so it 's harder for people to attach themselves
the @entity1 games have done well but they are largely curiosities
" however , @entity194 believes that @entity5 fans are more tolerant of international games that their @entity24 counterparts as @entity58 " are often more attached to the league than a team
" the @entity5 also has the advantage of avoiding barriers from international bodies that the @entity23 now faces
@entity217 -- football 's global governing body -- rules dictate that games abroad would need to be approved by all relevant member associations and confederations , with the global authority retaining a veto in any case
@entity202 , which runs @entity226 football , is emphasizing the obstacles , while the @entity150 confederation previously rejected the " 39th game
" the timing is problematic , against the backdrop of mounting criticism and supporter disillusionment with governance in the @entity24 game
a leading concern is ticket prices that have risen over 1000 % in many cases since the @entity23 was introduced in 1992 , pricing out younger and lower - earning fans , an issue which has led to fan activists targeting sponsors
fans also argue that prohibitive pricing has damaged the matchday atmosphere , and there is increasing acknowledgment that this is under threat
@entity28 manager @entity249 recently criticized the club 's home support , saying it felt like his team was " playing in an empty stadium , " while various clubs are promoting initiatives such as dedicated singing sections
@entity258 directed at club owners is growing , fueled by disastrous cases of mismanagement at teams such as @entity263 and @entity264 , both of which have entered administration and tumbled out of @entity24 's elite division
thirty - six league clubs have gone into administration in the @entity23 era
supporters are demanding a greater role in clubs ' decisions , often inspired by @entity176 's 50 +1 rule that guarantees majority fan ownership
@entity24 clubs like @entity279 and @entity264 have been saved from extinction by fans who now run them successfully
that model could become commonplace
the @entity284 has committed to historic legislation should it win next year 's election , that would see supporter representatives on the boards of every club in @entity24
the government has responded with a working group aiming to facilitate supporter ownership
despite their many grievances , the loyalty of local fan bases was shown by attendances of 96 % capacity at @entity23 games in 2012/13
but playing league games abroad would represent an unprecedented test of that loyalty , at a time of growing tension
it would motivate and mobilize vast numbers of local supporters in opposition , to prove they can not be taken for granted the issue marks a crossroads for major @entity24 clubs on the journey from community institutions to global brands
should the campaign against matches abroad succeed , it could mark a new era of supporter involvement and democratic ownership
if the @entity23 gets its wish for foreign fixtures , it could pave the way for even more radical transformations such as cross-border leagues and the slashing of the domestic calendar
at a time of great uncertainty , only change is guaranteed .
