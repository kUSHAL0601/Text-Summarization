@entity0 -- nearly eight years after @entity5 's founder was among those convicted for essentially looting the cable company , fraud victims can now get their share of a record $ 728 million fund , the top federal prosecutor in @entity0 announced monday
a news release from the office of @entity11 , @entity12 attorney for the @entity13 , described the payout as the " largest single distribution to victims " in the history of the @entity12 @entity18
it has been years in the making
four @entity5 executives were arrested in 2002 in a case that prosecutors then described as " one of the most elaborate and extensive corporate frauds in @entity12 history
" at the time , @entity5 was the fifth largest cable company in the nation
two years later , ceo and founder @entity29 was found guilty of conspiracy , securities fraud and bank fraud , among other charges , for raiding the company of hundreds of millions of dollars for his personal use
he was later sentenced to 15 years in prison
his son @entity38 was found guilty of conspiracy and 15 counts of securities fraud and two counts of bank fraud
@entity29 ' other son , @entity45 , and a fourth defendant , @entity47 , a former director of internal reporting , were found not guilty of conspiracy , and the jury failed to reach verdicts on most of the other charges against @entity53
in 2005 , officials announced that the then - bankrupt cable operator agreed to a deal that allowed its operators -- who cooperated with investigators -- to avoid criminal prosecution
@entity5 was officially sold off to @entity61 and @entity62 , the parent company of @entity1 , months later
the victims fund amounted to nearly half of an estimated $ 1.5 billion in assets , including @entity5 stock worth about $ 567 million , that the @entity53 family forfeited as part of a complex series of agreements announced by then @entity12 attorney general @entity71
the @entity12 attorney 's office explained that in the years since that settlement was reached , officials have undertaken " the complex process of notifying large numbers of potential victims , processing more than 13,000 petitions , verifying pecuniary losses and recommending ... distribution of the forfeited funds to the attorney general
" about 8,500 petitions sought for a portion of the fund were granted for " victims who suffered financial losses as a direct result of the fraud , " according to @entity11 's office .
