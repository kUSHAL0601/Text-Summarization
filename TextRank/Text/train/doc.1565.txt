-- @entity4 quarterback @entity3 will meet this week with an @entity2 official as part of the league 's investigation into allegations that he sent sexually explicit messages to women , an @entity2 spokesman said monday
" it 's no secret , " @entity2 spokesman @entity13 said
" any time you review a matter like this , you 're going to talk to the person involved
what we 've said is , ' yes , we will be interviewing him as part of the process
' " @entity13 said the meeting with @entity3 would not include commissioner @entity26 , but the spokesman would not divulge with whom or where the meeting was to take place
" we do n't generally provide these kind of details , " @entity13 said
asked sunday what he expects to come out of the meeting , @entity3 said , " i do n't expect anything
as i said last week , during the week , tonight , i 'm concerned about the next game
i 'll let that take its course
" sunday 's news conference came after @entity3 led the @entity4 to a 24 - 21 victory over the @entity42 , going 14 for 18 with 119 yards , one touchdown and one turnover
the claims were first published by the sports website @entity47 , which has posted nude pictures , text and voice messages it alleges he sent to a model and former television host who worked for the @entity56 in 2008
the @entity56 have given @entity2 officials all the information they have regarding the incident , a team spokesman said last week
@entity62 , a spokesman for the @entity56 , told @entity69 's " @entity68 " that the team has no role in the allegations against @entity3 , who played one season in @entity67 and now plays for the @entity4
@entity3 , who has been married for 14 years , has had no public comment on the allegations
he signed with the @entity4 in august 2009 after emerging from retirement for the second time in as many years
@entity47 first reported in august that @entity3 sent text messages , left voice mails and sent pictures of himself naked from the waist down to @entity76 , who worked as a sideline personality and host for the @entity56 at the time
it also published what it said were excerpts from the messages
afterward , @entity47 reported that a second woman had come forward to allege that she had received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman , whom the site did not identify , had received similar messages
the site reported the two women were massage therapists hired by the @entity56 and identified them only by pseudonyms
@entity62 said the therapists were hired for two days in the team 's 2008 training camp and would not confirm whether they had any direct contact with @entity3
@entity0 could not independently confirm whether the voice in the recordings belongs to @entity3 or whether he sent the notes
@entity76 's representatives have declined comment
@entity102 , @entity47 's editor - in - chief and author of the @entity3 stories , told @entity0 last week that no one from the @entity2 has contacted him about an investigation into @entity3
he acknowledged that third - party sources were paid for the story about @entity76 and that he could not say definitively that the messages or photos the site posted came from the 41 - year - old quarterback
@entity3 played most of his career with the @entity114 , leading the team to a @entity117 title in 1997
he was traded to the @entity56 after the 2007 season .
