@entity4 @entity3 president @entity2 is willing to participate in the formation of a new government in @entity7 , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 said tuesday
on monday , @entity2 told @entity9 's @entity8 that he would press the issue of @entity3 independence with @entity0 when the @entity1 official visited @entity13 , saying , " the @entity3 people should seize the opportunity now
" @entity3 have complained that @entity4 prime minister @entity18 's @entity17 - dominated government has marginalized them , a feeling shared by @entity4 's @entity22 @entity21 minority
in his interview with @entity9 , @entity0 said @entity4 leaders he has spoken with have " realized they can not continue with this sectarian division " -- a realization that would presumably include a greater role for @entity3 in governance
i 'm not taking anything i hear to the bank and saying , ' wow , it 's going to be solved , ' " he said
" but i 'm hearing things that indicate to me that if they follow through on the things they 're saying , there 's a capacity to have a new government that could be a unity government , that could reflect a greater capacity for success
" @entity4 government claims gains in anti-militant fight the @entity1 has sent military advisers to counsel @entity4 commanders on how best to take the fight to militants trying to create an @entity52 state in @entity53 and @entity4
@entity1 officials also have promised what @entity0 said monday would be " sustained " and " intense " aid
president @entity57 is also weighing military intervention short of combat troops
but forming a new @entity4 government is a crucial precursor to further @entity1 intervention to stop the @entity63 in @entity4 and @entity53 , or @entity64 , @entity0 said
" the key is , if you do n't have a viable government , that is a unity government that is not going to repeat the mistakes of the last few years , whatever we might choose to do would be extraordinarily hampered , " he said
@entity0 said failing to come up with a new political structure would make it " very difficult to be successful " with a military intervention
still , he noted , the president maintains the right to engage in such activity , with or without a political solution , if he decides that doing so is in the @entity1 ' interest
" he reserves the right to use force if he has to , " said @entity0 , " if it 's going to accomplish a goal
" he denied that @entity57 's decision not to launch airstrikes against @entity53 -- where @entity64 has gained much of its strength -- or delays in making a decision about what to do in @entity4 have made the crisis worse
" ... you 've got to have a holistic , comprehensive approach , and the president is trying to figure out , as we are , i am , whether or not @entity4 is prepared to be part of that , " he said
in the interview , @entity0 defended @entity57 's decision not to go forward with military strikes in @entity53
" the reason that the decision to strike @entity53 did n't happen was because we ultimately came up with a better solution after the president made his decision to strike , " @entity0 said , referring to an agreement that required @entity98 's regime to give up its chemical weapons stockpile
on monday , the organization tasked with monitoring the weapons removal said the @entity53 government had turned over all of its declared chemical weapons
" that 's a very significant accomplishment , " said @entity0
political chatter : the new @entity4 debate @entity0 assures @entity4 of @entity1 support if they unite against militants
