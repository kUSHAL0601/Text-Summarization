-- we 've just landed a washing machine - sized robot on a comet and @entity6 's chief scientist has no idea
dr @entity8 is deep in conversation with a journalist when , unable to contain himself any longer , an adviser with phone triumphantly held aloft blurts out : " @entity14 -- it 's landed ! " " @entity16 beams , and the handful of reporters gathered in a lecture theater at @entity20 excitedly fidget in their seats
barely has the probe touched down on a comet 310 million miles from @entity23 , then one of science 's great minds is discussing humanity 's next cosmic milestone
@entity8 wants to land a man on @entity30 by the mid- 2030s
or rather , " land a human on @entity30 , " the mother - of - three corrects me with a wry smile
" in a sense it 's our destiny to move beyond this planet and @entity30 is the logical choice , " said the 53 - year - old geologist
" it 's a place where humans could live and work -- not out in the open -- but with not too - radical modifications
" indeed , life on the ' @entity30 ' may not just be the stuff of science fiction
" @entity30 is the other body in the solar system that we 're very likely to find that life evolved , " said @entity8
" so being able to have a laboratory on @entity30 , being able to have some sort of sustained human presence on @entity30 in the future , i think is critically important for science
" next stop : @entity30 surviving an eight - month journey to @entity30 is one thing -- staying alive once there is another
astronauts would face high levels of radiation -- " we still have to figure out how to adequately protect them , " said @entity8
the thin atmosphere would also make landing difficult , particularly for a heavy spaceship loaded with equipment and people
" if you think of the @entity75 capsule coming into @entity23 with a parachute , the @entity30 atmosphere is just so thin you 've got to find some way of slowing yourself down really rapidly , " explained @entity8 , the daughter of a @entity6 engineer who watched her first rocket launch as a four - year - old
at the time , the un-manned launch spectacularly exploded , leaving a huge impression on the little girl who decades later has set her sights on a mission to @entity30
the interplanetary endeavor has more to do with unlocking @entity23 's secrets than you might think
" being able to compare the @entity23 to @entity86 , to @entity30 , and studying these same processes all around the solar system -- all of a sudden you get smarter about your own planet , " explained @entity8
" if you 're a doctor and you only have one patient , then you 'd never really understand the progression of disease
you need lots of patients , and scientists learn more about the @entity23 by studying lots of planets
" @entity102 reality but with so many earthly problems , does it pay to point billion dollar budgets at the skies ? " you know , we 're really spending that money here on @entity23 , " said @entity8
" we get amazing technology spinoffs from the work @entity6 has done , " she adds , listing everything from fuel efficient winglets on airplanes , to air traffic control systems , and equipment for measuring climate change
science fiction becomes reality in @entity6 's lab , with the hovering orb seen in @entity102 -- fans will remember @entity124 using it during light - saber training -- inspiring real - life gadgets on board the @entity129
" think about these things you used to see on tv from science fiction , like communicators on @entity135 , well now we actually have them , " said @entity8
" space exploration pushes us to say ' here 's things we 've just dreamed about , but we can turn that into reality
' " @entity142 the @entity30 does that mean she also believes in intelligent life ? " i think there has to be in the universe -- how easy it 's going to be to find , is another question , " said @entity8
" statistically every time you 're looking at a star you 're likely to be looking at a planetary system
play the math game , there 's billions of stars , so eventually you 'll come out saying there has to be another body where life could have evolved to a fairly sophisticated level
" now , do i think they 're visiting here and altering people 's crop patterns ? no. if they were smart enough to get here , we would know about it
" women 's business ? as a women working at @entity6 , sometimes it 's @entity8 who feels like the alien in the room , admitting : " i had to work four times as hard to be taken half as seriously
" " i still go into most meetings and i will look around the room and i just suddenly register the male to female ratio -- women usually make up 10 % to 20 % in any room i 'm in , at best
" it 's a ratio fairly consistent with women working across @entity185 sectors ( science , technology , engineering , math ) in the @entity190 , and @entity8 speaks passionately about the need for " all hands on deck
" " when you have problems like trying to get humans down onto the surface of @entity30 , if you do n't have all the best minds in the world -- not just white men -- then you 're not utilizing humanity the way you should
" landing a human on @entity30 would inspire a new generation of scientists -- the likes of which we have n't seen since the @entity75 mission 45 years ago , says @entity8
" it 's a great international human endeavor , with all the nations of the world moving out beyond @entity23 to explore a new planet , a new world
" and doing it together
