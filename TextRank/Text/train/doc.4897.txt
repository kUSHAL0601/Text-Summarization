-- it is the place where the " @entity3 " chant was invented
it is or has been home to @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8
a man once distracted an opponent 's free - throw shooter by rising from his seat and dancing while wearing a dark blue @entity13 and nothing else
that guy became a pastor
the college basketball fans at @entity19 , where there are just 9,314 seats , are not only known for being loud , they take pride in getting into opponents ' heads
they are a coordinated cacophony that gives the @entity26 a home - court advantage only a handful of teams have
@entity30 has won nearly 84 % of its games in @entity32 since 1940
the @entity33 are so famous , they were even in a @entity35 commercial
but recently , the young fans have been the subject of scorn from former crazies , other basketball fans , the media and even @entity26 's legendary coach , @entity42
they have n't been their old selves , and they have n't been filling the undergraduate students section , not even to cheer on a top - 10 team
@entity26 has 1,000 spots for undergrads but has sold up to 400 of those seats to other @entity26 fans this year
as @entity26 enters the heart of conference play , student attendance has picked up recently , senior @entity50 , one of two student ticket line monitors , said in an e-mail
the smaller undergrad crowds is not a new trend ; there have been fewer of them in @entity59 for the past few seasons
but this season , the lack of passion has been noticeable
coach @entity64 had these words after a january victory at @entity68 , according to the @entity69 : " this team is trying to develop and do n't just watch them , be with them
this saturday let 's be out there at noon [ they won against @entity79 's ] and be the @entity33
if you do n't want to do it , then do n't , but it will be a mistake
i think sometimes you just take things for granted
" the students responded to the coach 's call ; @entity87 said @entity88 was over capacity
longtime @entity26 fan @entity90 says there are several reasons @entity32 is a different place these days
@entity90 -- who grew up in @entity94 , has seen hundreds of games in @entity32 and runs the message board forum @entity97 -- points a finger at a tech - rich culture , a student body more focused on academics , conference expansion and the team 's " ridiculous success
" no question @entity26 is one of the most beloved teams and one of the most hated -- in large part because it wins so much
with four national titles and fourth place on the all - time victories list , the @entity26 are on tv and the front pages of newspapers and sports websites constantly
" people get spoiled ; they get used to ( winning ) , " @entity90 said
" but the secret of @entity32 , and people who have n't been around a while do n't realize , but @entity32 really became a great place out of frustration
" he explained that in the 1970s , other teams came in with their stars -- @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127 of @entity68 and @entity128 of @entity129 -- and whipped @entity26 's butt
since there was no beating them on the court , @entity26 fans turned to making fun of them , @entity90 said
and those fans , including the most raucous ones known as @entity8 , were often hilarious and often downright offensive
@entity138 , columnist for the @entity139 in @entity140 , said the fans sometimes crossed the line , but they were spontaneous
" they 've turned into the @entity144 , " he said
everybody knows exactly what 's next
" at @entity26 , students will work on a cheer sheet and hand them out to those who attend games
some students have complained that new cheers are needed
they also say there needs to be better coordination
there are other factors at play , king and @entity138 said , and these could affect all schools
in the early 1980s , when @entity42 was new to @entity26 and the @entity26 were beginning to win consistently again , there were no fans texting on cellphones or updating @entity166 pages , @entity138 said
sure , some brought books so they could study during breaks , but their attention spans were longer and more focused on basketball
these days , not so much
there also were no huge tvs in the dorms , where students do n't have to wait for hours in cold lines to get into the arena , where they might stand ( or jump up and down ) in closer - than - close quarters for three - plus hours
today 's students can also watch anywhere on campus on computers or smartphones
and there are now 12 teams in the @entity186 ( two more schools join the league next season ) , and old school rivalries have been diminished as a result , said @entity138 , who has seen more than 300 games in @entity32 since 1957
like many superconferences , the @entity186 has grown so big that schools sometimes play conference opponents only once a year instead of twice
for @entity26 , it means people do n't care about some games as much anymore , @entity90 said
it 's hard to get worked up about a revenge game if a year separates a loss and the next contest
things will get better , @entity204 , a former crazy known as @entity205 , wrote in a letter to @entity26 fans on @entity97
" you may think that the @entity209 are n't up to the standards of the past , but maybe this current crop is merely going through its own growing pains , " he wrote
" maybe they are n't spoiled and complacent
maybe they are learning on the job
" @entity87 wrote that students were anxious to be part of the tradition
" people are painting up , making signs , and counting down the minutes until the doors to cameron open , " she said
a betting man would probably wager that @entity88 will be full on saturday when @entity26 is host to @entity68 , which fancies itself one of @entity26 's rivals ( @entity26 fans feel a little differently )
coming off a miraculous comeback win against the no. 5 @entity229 , @entity26 and its crazies have to have their swagger back
if the spontaneity and enthusiasm return with it , the @entity232 might just want to invest in some earplugs
and the @entity229 , when they come march 3 , well , it 'll be as crazy that day as ever in @entity32 .
