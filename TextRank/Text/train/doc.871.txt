@entity1 , @entity2 a black - and - white photo shows the 16 - year - old ballerina at her prime , mere months before her world would be destroyed
she is dressed in a bathing suit , smiling radiantly while performing a gymnastic split
@entity9 says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush : a @entity13 boy named @entity14
he , like so many others , would not survive the @entity17
" i had my 17th birthday in @entity19 , " @entity9 says
seventy years later , @entity9 appears frail at first glance , until she astounds a new acquaintance by performing a dance kick that goes shoulder - high
the 87 - year old says her fondest childhood memories still revolve around dancing and training to compete for the @entity29 @entity28 team as a gymnast
" but then i was told that i had to train somewhere else because i 'm @entity13 , and i do not qualify [ for the @entity28 ] , " @entity9 recalls
" my dream was totally shattered
" @entity9 was a @entity29 jew , the youngest of three daughters , living in a town called @entity34 in what is modern - day @entity36
her father was a tailor ; her mother , a civil servant
it was n't until march 1944 , late in @entity43 , that @entity9 says @entity29 nazis came to her house and arrested her family
the @entity13 in @entity29 were among the last of @entity49 's @entity13 communities to be targeted by the @entity44
the family was taken to other internment centers before they were finally loaded into a train and shipped to the @entity19 concentration camp in @entity54 , occupied by @entity55
" my mom held me in the cattle car , " @entity9 recalls
" and she said , ' we do n't know where we 're going
we do n't know what 's going to happen
just remember no one can take away from you what you put here in your own mind
' " upon arrival at the camp , @entity9 said dr. @entity67 , one of the @entity19 complex 's top medical officers , stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks
" he pointed to my mom to go to the left , and i followed my mom , " @entity9 says
" and dr. @entity67 grabbed me -- i never forget that eye contact -- and he said ' you 're going to see you mother soon , she 's just going to take a shower
' " it was the last time @entity9 saw her parents
they died in the gas chambers of @entity19 along with more than a million other @entity13
but that would not be the ballerina 's final encounter with the infamous @entity91 doctor who later became known the " @entity92
" " dr. @entity67 came to the barracks and wanted to be entertained , " @entity9 says
fellow inmates " volunteered " @entity9 to perform for the man who had ordered her parents ' death
she asked her captors to play the @entity99 as she danced for one of the worst war criminals of the @entity17
" i was so scared , " @entity9 says
" i closed my eyes , and i pretended that the music was @entity104 , and i was dancing ' @entity105 ' in the @entity107 opera house
" the @entity109 doctor rewarded the @entity13 girl with an extra ration of bread , which she later shared with the girls in her prison quarters
@entity9 says months later , those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through @entity119
" they formed a chair with their arms , and they carried me so i would n't die , " she says , adding , " is n't it important that the worst conditions really brought out the best in us ? " decades after the horrors of the @entity17 , dance is still a passion
@entity9 's house on a hill overlooking the @entity133 is decorated with statues of ballerinas
every sunday , she says she goes swing - dancing to the music that @entity138 soldiers introduced her to when they liberated her in @entity119 in 1945
" i want to have a full life , not to be damaged goods , " she says
perhaps that defiant spirit helped the teenager survive the horrors of @entity43 and later blossom as an emigre in the @entity138
shortly after the war , @entity9 met and married a fellow @entity29 jew who had been a partisan , anti-nazi fighter
the young family moved with their infant daughter to the @entity138 to escape communist rule in @entity29
" she was very shy when i was growing up , " recalls @entity9 's eldest daughter , @entity152 who says her mother transformed in the 1970s , after a visit to @entity19
" after that , she changed dramatically , " the daughter says
" there had always been a bit of sadness behind her eyes , and afterwards , it was gone
i think it did free her , and she became who she is now
" it was also in the 1970s that @entity9 began studying psychology
decades later , she still works as a clinical psychologist , running a practice out of her home in @entity1
her specialty involved treating patients suffering from post traumatic stress disorder
" she evolved at a time as a psychologist when @entity179 was n't even on the map , " says dr. @entity173 , professor emeritus in psychiatry at the @entity175 , who has known and worked with @entity9 for more than 20 years
" she is an expert by definition almost by having had that experience herself but also relating to it in a clinical way , as well as in a deeply personal way , " @entity173 said
throughout her career in psychology , @entity9 has done extensive consulting work with the @entity138 military , treating @entity138 veterans of wars in @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193
she has also helped set up shelters for female victims of domestic abuse
" @entity19 gave me a tremendous gift in some ways , that i can guide people to have resilience and perseverance , " @entity9 says
in time , @entity9 also become a motivational public speaker , performing a @entity203 and giving speeches at schools and universities
she litters her @entity29 - accented @entity207 with aphorisms aimed at mental healing
" @entity212 love is self care , " she tells patients
" the biggest concentration camp is in our mind
" " she blew me away with her extraordinary optimism and energy , " @entity173 says , recalling the first time he saw @entity9 speaking to an audience
" she is a force of nature
" seventy years after the liberation of @entity19 , this @entity17 survivor 's greatest pride and joy are clearly her three great - grandchildren
" that 's the best revenge to @entity235 i can think of , " says the dancer , pointing at one of several portraits of her smiling great - grandchildren in her office .
