-- if you love big - ship cruising but crave a more intimate experience , then the small boats plying the rivers of @entity6 -- and beyond -- are just the ticket
@entity0 's trip coach answers readers ' top questions about river cruising : why am i hearing so much about river cruising these days ? imagine sailing the @entity14 past the temples of @entity16 , floating by medieval castles on the @entity18 , or tooling along the @entity20 through aging @entity22 colonial towns in @entity23 -- all from your own private balcony
if this sounds pretty appealing to you , you 're not alone
about 215,000 @entity27 will sail on riverboats this year , up nearly 60 percent since 2004
the spectacular growth has led to a surge of options across @entity6 and in far - flung destinations like @entity33 and @entity34
it 's also ushered in a host of impressive improvements
outfitters are introducing new ships with larger cabins and upscale touches such as floor - to - ceiling windows and private balconies
even on older boats , however , river cruising has inherent perks : the ships are smaller , so the service tends to be more personal and the atmosphere among passengers is more familiar
also , on most lines all excursions , food and drinks ( including beer and wine at meals ) are included in the cost of the trip , so there 's no need to touch your wallet once you set sail
how do i choose the best company for me ? here 's a fact that might help simplify things : 75 percent of @entity27 passengers travel with one of just five river cruise operators
chances are , you will , too
of the five , the winner of our @entity76 ' choice poll , @entity78 , is the largest , with 24 percent of the entire market and a reputation for generous promotions , including frequent two - for - one deals
although it 's headquartered in @entity83 , @entity78 specializes in @entity85 itineraries , with 18 ships that cruise most of the @entity88 's major waterways
@entity89 , the next - biggest , has a more boutique , upscale ambience ( think plush guest robes and designer body - care products ) to go along with its slightly higher prices
the bargain of the bunch is @entity97 , which hosts group tours for " mature @entity99 " that tend to be cheaper and longer , albeit on ships that are a bit older and smaller
the most cosmopolitan is @entity103 : one third of its passengers hail from @entity108 - speaking countries other than the @entity99 , and it has the newest fleet in the game , averaging just 2 years old
rounding out the top five is @entity112 , which focuses on @entity85 destinations -- and local wines
thoughtful pairings are served at every meal
@entity0 : 15 places every kid should see how can i get the best deal ? unlike the price slashing you 'll find on big - ship ocean cruises , which have thousands of cabins to fill , last - minute discounts on riverboats are rare -- all the more reason to plan strategically
if your travel dates are flexible , you can often find two - for - one deals in the off - season ( which in most of @entity6 is late autumn to early spring )
if not , consider inviting friends and family and angle for a bulk discount
with @entity103 , for instance , a group 's 16th passenger comes along for free
finally , think about booking your trip @entity142 instead of buying one of the packages that operators typically offer , which often lump together cruising , land tours and hotel accommodations
booking just the boat portion of the trip can save you big
@entity89 's 12 - day highlights of @entity33 & the @entity154 package , for example , starts at $ 3,099
but only three nights of the itinerary are actually spent aboard a riverboat
you could choose to book the cruising portion separately , through @entity162 's charter , @entity158 , plan the rest of your trip yourself , and sail for as little as $ 470
@entity0 : the world 's most amazing hotel pools what about extra costs ? the travel world is rife with hidden fees these days -- except here , for the most part
some companies include port charges ( a standard fee of about $ 100 to $ 150 for a 7 night @entity85 cruise ) in the original listed price , but others mention it only in the fine print and charge passengers separately
as mentioned , alcoholic drinks are free during mealtime on most ships , but if you 're craving a cocktail at some other point , that will be extra , too
one thing to note : gratuities are n't automatically added on to river cruise bills as they are with ocean cruises
at the end of a river cruise , envelopes are passed around with suggested ( but entirely voluntary ) tip amounts written on the front
@entity0 : 5 popular @entity85 river cruises can i bring my kids along ? keep these guidelines in mind : if you 're under 50 , you 'll be considered young ; if you 're under 30 , you 'll be a downright novelty ; and if you 're under 4 , then sorry
some companies , however , are starting to offer family - travel incentives
@entity89 , for example , is introducing two new itineraries this fall in which 4 - to 18 - year - olds travel for half price
that said , whether you want to bring them is another matter
