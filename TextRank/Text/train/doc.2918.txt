-- if @entity2 lived by @entity4 's rule and removed one accessory before leaving for the @entity6 sunday , we all would have been worse for the wear
the producer / singer / songwriter showed up in a hat that became the conversation piece on a night when the conversation should have been about the music
somehow , @entity2 's hat out - performed @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 combined
when the artist first arrived on the red carpet , we could n't wrap our minds -- nay , our eyes -- around what we were seeing
the headgear seemed to be as tall as it was wide , and we could n't tell if @entity2 was channeling @entity25 : @entity27 's hat - loving companion : @entity28 was just a devoted fan of @entity29 's
of course it did n't take long until @entity2 's hat got its own @entity33 account
in the end , what appeared to be a fashion faux pas turned into a style win by the end of the night
@entity40 's hair during her opening performance of " @entity42 " ? that 's another story
the superstar took the stage with a short hairstyle of wet waves -- an obvious reference to the hair she wears in the music video for the song
but @entity33 took one look at the water - logged locks and went wild : we do n't think @entity57 @entity40 suffered as much criticism as @entity59 did , though
while the 55 - year - old mom explained that her black suit , hat and cane were chosen by her son , @entity64 ( who wore a matching outfit ) , that did n't make the armchair fashionistas any kinder
but , for all the talk about their outfits , all three artists walked away with bigger accomplishments last night
@entity40 stunned on the red carpet and off it with her performance , @entity2 walked away with the producer of the year ( non-classical ) grammy award , and @entity59 helped marry off 33 couples -- yes , 33 ! -- during a performance of @entity79 ' " @entity80
" @entity83 rock all - white ensembles at @entity6 @entity84 spitting nails after cutoff 5 things we loved about the 2014 @entity6
