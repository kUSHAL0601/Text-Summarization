@entity0 -- @entity2 and dr. @entity3 exchanged harsh accusations in lawsuits filed by the singer and producer tuesday
@entity2 's civil complaint filed in @entity0 claims that dr. @entity3 sexually , physically and verbally abused her over the 10 years since he signed her as an 18 - year - old artist
dr. @entity3 's lawsuit filed hours later in @entity11 contends @entity2 made up " outrageous and untrue statements " to extort him into releasing her from her recording contract with his label
her lawsuit demands that she be paid damages for suffering he caused and that her contract with dr. @entity3 , whose real name is @entity3 , be declared void because of the abuse
@entity2 , whose full name is @entity2 , was " an intelligent , family - oriented , and joyful young woman " before dr. @entity3 " showered her with promises of fame and fortune " and induced her to sign a contract with him in 2005 , her lawsuit said
instead of living a life of @entity36 glamor , she " lived in a prison of his abuse , " the lawsuit said
her complaint accuses him of giving her a " date rape drug " that allowed him to sexually assault her while she was unconscious
he allegedly used constant verbal insults -- such as calling her " a fat f -- king refrigerator " -- " to make her feel completely worthless and maintain complete control over her life
" the abuse did n't end after her debut album sold more than a million copies in the @entity51 in 2010 , her complaint said
" for the past 10 years , dr. @entity3 has sexually , physically , verbally and emotionally abused " her " to the point where ms. @entity2 nearly lost her life , " it said
@entity2 , 27 , developed the eating disorder bulimia nervosa , which almost killed her , because of the continuous criticism about her weight by dr. @entity3 , according to her complaint
she entered a rehabilitation center to be treated for the disorder earlier this year , the lawsuit said
her doctors concluded that the " unrelenting emotional and psychological abuse " by dr. @entity3 caused her to suffer " severe depression , post-traumatic stress , social isolation , and panic attacks
" continuing contact with him " would be ' life threatening , ' " the lawsuit said
@entity2 's lawyer @entity69 said her lawsuit " is a wholehearted effort by @entity2 to regain control of her music career and her personal freedom after suffering for 10 years as a victim of mental manipulation , emotional abuse and sexual assault at the hands of dr. @entity3
" " the facts presented in our lawsuit paint a picture of a man who is controlling and willing to commit horrible acts of abuse in an attempt to intimidate an impressionable , talented , young female artist into submission for his personal gain
@entity2 is focused on moving her life and her career beyond this terrible time , " @entity69 said
@entity97 , the lawyer who filed the suit for dr. @entity3 , said @entity2 's complaint " is nothing more than a continuation of her bad and offensive acts
" " as set forth in the complaint that we have filed on behalf of dr. @entity3 , @entity2 and her mother are engaged in a campaign of publishing outrageous and untrue statements about dr. @entity3 to third parties , including scurrilous and false statements of purported physical and mental abuse of @entity2 , " @entity97 said
" we are confident that dr. @entity3 will prevail in all matters , and that our client will be awarded substantial damages for this malicious conduct , " @entity97 said
@entity69 said the singer is ready to put the past behind her
" this is just another pathetic and entirely predictable example of dr. @entity3 's continued abuse , and a misguided attempt to keep @entity2 under his tyrannical control , " @entity69 said
" this lawsuit has absolutely no basis in fact , the law or reality
@entity2 is focused on reclaiming her voice and her freedom
she is determined to move on with her life and her career by putting this dark period behind her
