" vandals and thugs lost their human faces
" after the announcement that @entity1 had prevailed with 79 % of the vote sunday , according to preliminary election results , opposition candidates and their supporters took to the streets in @entity17 , the capital , and clashed with police

he said he was told by health minister @entity45 that @entity37 's injuries were not serious , and that @entity41 " rushed to take shelter in a hospital " after being struck in the head
another candidate , @entity50 , told state - run @entity36 news agency @entity51 that he , too , was beaten

however , the @entity56 said that while the election showed improvement , " @entity2 still has a considerable way to go in meeting its @entity56 commitments
" however , @entity2 ' @entity63 , in a statement on its website , said the " overwhelming majority " of those arrested were " drunk unemployed people and students of various schools and universities , some of them under age
" " actions like those would n't have been tolerated in any civilized country , " @entity1 told reporters monday

water cannons , tear gas , mass arrests of hooligans -- and they 'd be done away with in no time

the @entity56 has repeatedly expressed concerns over the status of civil and political rights in @entity2

the people of @entity2 deserved better
and , in particular , i now expect the government to account for the arrests of presidential candidates , journalists and human rights activists

the @entity63 said authorities knew in advance that some presidential candidates planned to " stage unsanctioned mass rallies
" the gatherings at first seemed peaceful , according to the ministry statement , but " turned into an attempt to seize the government building where the @entity188 was located

police are working on identifying the organizers and participants , " as well as documenting their crimes and estimating the inflicted damage , " the ministry said
