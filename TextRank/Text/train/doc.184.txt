-- sunday night 's @entity2 telecast was enough to make you drop your knitting and stare in amazement at the contortions being performed on stage at the none - dare - call - it - @entity9 -- and not necessarily by @entity12 , whose performance was one of the evening 's weirder moments
was it really just a year and a day ago that the @entity2 made its big play for youth , via the double - edged disaster of @entity19 and @entity20 ? ok , that did n't work
but last night 's full - frontal embrace of the past -- punctuated in no small way by the choice of a silent movie as @entity27 -- was a back flip , a half - twist , and a landing in deep denial
it was n't the @entity2 's fault that the show 's director - elect @entity35 self - destructed , or that @entity35 's hand - picked host @entity36 bailed , or that the plucky @entity37 had to be called in to host a show he had n't done since 2004
it is n't @entity37 's fault that he 's 63 years old
but someone -- producer @entity41 , perhaps -- should answer for why a show celebrating an industry in so much trouble chose to cast itself as something so profoundly @entity46 Â©
at a time when audiences are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the very " theatrical experience " the @entity2 spends so much time championing , why would the show 's writers and producers characterize the idea of going to the movies as something quaint , nostalgic and on the way out ? time and again , participants reflected on moviegoing as something they remembered fondly from their childhoods
they might have been talking about the @entity61
it was a strange tone to take , especially since anyone who pays any attention at all to the media -- or lives in @entity67 , or talks to other people -- knew that " @entity73 " was poised to win @entity27 , @entity70 and @entity71 ( which it did )
when you have an 800 - pound metaphor pending delivery , why add insult to injury ? @entity79 : the winners list it did n't help , of course , that the show was being held in the erstwhile @entity9 , which had a name change since the venerable company filed for bankruptcy
@entity37 never mentioned the word " @entity93 , " probably believing that it might make people in the film industry nervous that the company synonymous with film would be going out of business
but it was n't the issue of changing technology that gave last night 's show a stale air
it was the issue of unchanging taste
@entity37 , game as usual , opened the show with the same shtick he 's used all of the nine times he 's hosted , including the comedy montage of mock scenes from nominated movies
it 's never had any edge and is n't intended to , but the general tone of the comedy was bloodless , and even blinkered : delivering one gag about the advanced age of @entity118 nominees @entity119 and @entity120 , the host suggested that next year 's show would be sponsored by @entity122 ( the prostate drug )
this might have been funny , if 1 ) the disconnect between the @entity2 and anyone under 30 was n't so pronounced ; 2 ) @entity120 and @entity119 were n't among the classiest guys in the room ; and 3 ) they were n't that much older than a lot of other people present
@entity120 , showing that age is what you make of it , delivered the evening 's most eloquent acceptance speech
but as deserving as he was ( for " @entity136 " ) , he could n't help but point up the industry 's affection for the past , especially its own
share your view on the @entity2 no one can deny best actress @entity141 is almost routinely spectacular , or that she gave a marvelous performance last year , albeit in a mediocre movie ( " @entity144 " )
but there were several supposed sure things going into last night 's awards
and the only one that did n't come true was @entity151 ' selection as best actress for " the help
" granted , @entity141 's last win was 13 nominations ago ( 1983 , " @entity156 " )
but given that @entity158 took home the @entity161 award for " the help , " and got a standing ovation from the @entity2 crowd besides , it makes you wonder
it could be that voters thought @entity169 ' screen time was insufficient for the @entity171 prize , or that she was n't the center of the story ( @entity174 was , arguably )
but that 's probably giving the @entity2 more credit than it deserves
the fact is , @entity178 gave a much broader , comedic performance ; @entity169 ' work spoke to the real pain of racism
similarly , the choice for @entity184 -- " undefeated , " the weakest among a pretty feeble list of nominees -- was about a white football coach and his black high school team , the kind of " @entity191 " vehicle that @entity2 voters gravitate to
why ? because it makes them feel good without straining
for a town synonymous with left - leaning politics , @entity67 has never looked so starched and conservative
the idea would probably make @entity198 recoil in horror , but @entity67 's embrace of the past is rooted in the same thing as @entity205 primary voters ' embrace of reactionary candidates : a profoundly uncertain future
i like " @entity73 " as much as anyone ( ok , probably a little less ) , but for all its charms , it 's not a forward - looking film
and last night 's @entity2 was not a forward - looking show
it was rooted in a kind of paralysis , the kind that accompanies a deep - seated fear
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .
