-- the statistics are devastating , but for aid workers like @entity3 and @entity4 , witnessing the despair from the @entity7 flooding was far more tragic than they imagined
" you can see 8,000 to 10,000 people in @entity11 in the road , sleeping in the mud , " said @entity3 , a resident of @entity8
" all the people are sitting on the side of road , defecating there , drinking water there , living there
" roughly 4 million people are homeless from mammoth flooding that covered much of @entity7 for three weeks
hundreds of health facilities are damaged or destroyed
millions are at risk for deadly waterborne diseases from the filthy flood waters
officials estimate the death toll between 1,500 and 1,600 , but @entity3 says he thinks the numbers could skyrocket as water recedes and more bodies and animals surface
" everywhere we go we see eight to 10 feet of water , " said @entity3 , who traveled through inundated villages between @entity35 and @entity11
" all we see are the tops of houses
" just a month ago , @entity3 was a recreational rider in the @entity39 of @entity8
he did n't expect to use his off - roading skills to deliver life - saving supplies to flood victims across nearly impassible terrain and waters
" we never thought of that , " @entity3 said
" but when you see things happen like this , you ca n't just sit on the side and watch thousands of people die
" so club members , family and friends raised money for supplies to the neediest survivors
so far the @entity39 of @entity8 has distributed 100 tents and about eight truckloads of food
in @entity11 , where refugees are arriving en masse , the riders have distributed at least 400 hampers of food
each hamper contains 5 kilograms of flour , 5 kilograms of rice , a liter of oil , salt , tea and water
but the work has n't been easy
the stench of filth permeates the air
skin blisters surface from temperatures reaching 48 degrees @entity79 ( 118 degrees @entity80 )
@entity3 said he ca n't shake the image in his mind of young children chasing him as he tossed water from a moving truck
the truck was moving at least 30 kilometers per hour , but he could n't slow down
mobs of hundreds have pounced on aid workers delivering food or water
" it somehow gives the impression that these are greedy people , " @entity4 said
" but it 's not greed
" hundreds of thousands of @entity7 have acquired transmittable ailments such as acute watery diarrhea , scabies and respiratory infections
" this is the desperation phase right now , " @entity4 said
" i think a few weeks ... that 's when the diseases will get worse
" prime minister @entity103 has called a tuesday meeting of local and national health officials as well as @entity107 agencies and other international groups to address the mounting health crisis
the @entity107 says it still needs about $ 200 million for aid
@entity3 said he wonders why some are n't donating as much to @entity7 flood relief as they have to previous natural disasters , such as the @entity115 earthquake in january
" maybe it 's donor fatigue , " he said
" but that 's no excuse
" despite the heat , filth , disease and destruction , @entity4 said he had no regrets about his decision to help
" we could have stayed home and watched this happen on tv , " he said
" but someone has to take the next step
