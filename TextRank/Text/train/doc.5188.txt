-- as 36,000 marathoners get ready to pound the streets of @entity4 on monday , authorities have their own mammoth task ahead : trying to keep all 26.2 miles of the course safe
officials say they have gone to great lengths to make sure nothing like last year 's attacks will happen
for starters , no backpacks or rucksacks will be allowed on the course this year , said @entity14 , director of the @entity15
the bombs that killed three people and wounded 264 others last year were placed in backpacks
the @entity20 , which organizes the marathon , said spectators are also encouraged to leave backpacks and handbags at home
containers with more than 1 liter of liquid , costumes covering the face , and bulky clothes such as vests with pockets wo n't be allowed
and large flags or signs bigger than 11 inches by 17 inches are also banned from marathon venues
those venues include the start and finish areas , the course , the athletes ' village and areas where official events are held
unregistered runners and cyclists intending to jump into the race are n't welcome this year , either
" we are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year 's @entity50 as a display of support , " the @entity20 said in a statement
" but we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves
" the anniversary scare at a memorial to mark the one - year anniversary of the bombings , one sight evoked memories of the gruesome attacks : suspicious bags near the @entity50 finish line
police spotted the bags on @entity70 -- not far from where two pressure - cooker bombs exploded a year ago
the first clue that something was amiss came when an officer spotted a man carrying one of the bags walking barefoot in the rain down @entity70
police said he became very vocal and started yelling
when asked what was in his backpack , the man told the officer it was a rice cooker , @entity79 superintendent @entity81 said
" we looked into the backpack , saw that it was what appeared to be a rice cooker , had the individual take the knapsack off , drop it on the street , and he was taken into custody , " @entity81 said
the man was identified by prosecutors as @entity97 , also known as @entity97
he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct , disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device , @entity81 said
a bomb squad inspected the bag and deemed it safe
" in the process of rendering that safe , we noticed a second backpack off to the side , " @entity81 said
" nobody claimed ownership of it
at that time , that bag was rendered safe
" @entity81 said his officers are ready for this year 's marathon
in tuesday 's incident , he said , the " training kicked in
" " i have utmost praise for my officer , " @entity81 said
" that 's what he 's trained to do , that 's what he did , and that 's why i 'm proud of the guys of this department
" @entity127 : ' we are @entity128 , we own the finish line ' a massive enterprise this year 's marathon will be a massive enterprise
the race will have 9,000 more runners than last year
more spectators than ever before will also line the course , according to the @entity20
keeping that in mind , police will double the number of officers on patrol from last year , with 3,500 scattered among the crowd
they will be aided by 100 additional security cameras and bomb - sniffing dogs
" in this world , you never eliminate risk ; you never bring it down to zero , " state police col. @entity146 told reporters last month
" but we are working very hard at reducing that risk level and managing it to the best of our collective abilities
" authorities have not disclosed how much the extra security will cost
all they will offer is that it will be " much greater " than last year 's cost
but this year 's race will also reap millions of dollars
according to the @entity162 , the marathon and related events will bring in an estimated $ 175.8 million -- the highest - ever amount for a @entity50
@entity163 awaits trial @entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report .
