@entity0 , @entity1 -- coalition forces in @entity1 have killed the @entity5 insurgents responsible for the downing of a helicopter that left 38 @entity9 and @entity1 personnel dead , the commander of @entity9 forces there and @entity12 announced wednesday
a precision airstrike killed @entity14 -- a @entity5 leader -- and the insurgent who fired what 's believed to be the rocket - propelled grenade that brought down the helicopter , according to gen. @entity20 , the commander of @entity9 forces in @entity1
several of their @entity5 associates were also killed , @entity12 's @entity21 said
" this does not ease our loss , but we must and we will continue to relentlessly pursue the enemy , " @entity20 told @entity25 reporters assembled for a video news conference wednesday
the strike took place in @entity34 district , @entity36 province , on monday , the @entity21 said
a @entity5 spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment
@entity36 provincial spokesman @entity39 also could not be reached for comment
the attack on the helicopter saturday represented the worst single - incident loss of @entity9 life since the start of the @entity1 war
thirty @entity9 died in the crash , military officials said
the other victims were @entity1 personnel
the @entity25 will put the @entity51 death toll in the helicopter downing at 17 , according to two @entity25 officials
originally , @entity25 sources told the news media that 22 seals were killed
@entity14 was a key facilitator in an insurgent attack cell led by @entity59 , a @entity5 leader killed in a previous @entity61 mission , @entity20 said
@entity14 had as many as 12 @entity5 fighters under his command , including potential suicide bombers
" after an exhaustive manhunt , special operations forces located @entity14 and the shooter after receiving multiple intelligence leads and tips from local citizens , " the @entity21 statement said
" the two men were attempting to flee the country in order to avoid capture
" @entity21 troops found and followed the two into a wooded area and , after ensuring no civilians were around , called for the airstrike , the statement said
@entity20 said the aircraft involved in the strike announced by @entity12 was the @entity83 , but he did n't say how many
@entity20 said the strike did n't kill the @entity5 leader that @entity9 forces were hunting the night of the fatal attack , but he confirmed that @entity14 was killed in the f - 16 strike announced wednesday
the remains of all 38 of those killed in saturday 's incident arrived at @entity92 in @entity93 on tuesday for a " dignified transfer
" because the catastrophic nature of the crash made the remains difficult to identify , all were brought to the @entity9
the @entity99 explained that a " dignified transfer " is not a ceremony , but rather " the process by which , upon the return from the theater of operations to the @entity9 , the remains of fallen military members are transferred from the aircraft to a waiting vehicle and then to the port mortuary
" @entity25 spokesman col. @entity112 said the names , ages , hometowns and military units of the slain @entity9 will be released within the next 24 hours
he said the public announcement has been delayed for security reasons
the @entity1 remains will be returned to their families once identifications can be made , @entity9 officials said
@entity2 's @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report
