-- with an apology to his former business partner , @entity2 president @entity1 has broken down and tweeted
" @entity7 , i had to do it eventually , " @entity1 wrote monday on his newly minted @entity6 account
the apparent mea culpa to @entity11 ceo @entity10 is , so far , @entity1 's only post
but , by tuesday morning , he had already racked up nearly 24,000 followers on the rival networking site
@entity1 was co-founder ( or maybe an early employee , depending on who you believe ) of music - sharing site @entity18 and created sites @entity20 and causes in addition to helming @entity11 in its early days
he 's perhaps best known to most folks through his fictional interpretation by @entity26 in the movie " @entity28
" ( movie - version @entity1 was responsible for two of " @entity28 's " most famous lines , urging @entity10 to drop the " the " and just be " @entity11 " and saying that " what 's cool " is not $ 1 million , it 's $ 1 billion
for his part , the real @entity1 has called the movie pure fiction , saying he was portrayed inaccurately )
his tweet goes on to " blame " @entity38 , an entertainment marketer best known as @entity41 's agent
@entity1 's @entity6 debut comes , perhaps not coincidentally , as he looks set to launch his latest e-venture -- a video service called @entity46
his biographical information on @entity6 includes a link to a @entity50 profile titled " @entity1 : agent of @entity52
" it also links to @entity54 , the venture - capital firm in which @entity1 is a partner
and maybe he does n't owe @entity10 a full apology just yet
@entity1 's @entity11 page has more than 38,000 people who " like " it -- outpacing his @entity6 feed , at least for now .
