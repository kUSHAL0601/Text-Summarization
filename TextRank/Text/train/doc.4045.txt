-- relationship breakdowns can happen to anyone -- even to cities
after nearly 20 years of building ties with their " sister city " of @entity6 , @entity7 , leaders in @entity9 , @entity10 , have found a key sticking point -- @entity7 's clampdown on discussion of gay issues
the city council in @entity10 's capital voiced its concerns over @entity7 anti-gay policies on monday by adopting a resolution calling for an end to the " sister cities " relationship with @entity6
local news site @entity23 reported that the vote was unanimous
@entity7 has been drawing controversy for a recently enacted law that bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere that children could overhear
city council member @entity32 first brought the matter before the city council during a meeting last month
@entity9 mayor @entity36 had issued a statement saying that while he opposes the " oppression of the @entity40 community in @entity7 , " he also hopes to maintain the relationship with @entity6 , which began in 1994 with a @entity7 - language high school exchange program
" i encourage the city council and the commission to issue a resolution condemning the violence and discrimination in @entity7 , " @entity36 said
" we must denounce the bigotry , but we should not sever the sister city relationship , because we have the potential for progressive dialogue between citizens
" meanwhile , a local agency said tuesday there 's really no relationship to sever , according to @entity23
@entity58 president @entity57 said it was only one district within @entity6 that was the sister city for @entity9 , and that " ceased abruptly " when the governmental structure of @entity6 changed years ago
but the issue that triggered monday 's council vote is just one reflection from an international spotlight that is being cast on @entity7 ahead of the @entity65 in @entity66 early next year
@entity7 president @entity67 signed the anti-gay law , which took effect last month
it has been condemned by @entity7 and international rights groups as highly discriminatory
gay rights group @entity72 delivered a 320,000 - signature petition to the @entity76 headquarters in @entity77 , @entity78 , earlier this month
the petition urges the @entity76 to condemn the law and urges @entity7 to ensure the security of all visitors , athletes and @entity7 people before , during , and after the @entity84
the @entity76 said that it had " received assurances from the highest level of government in @entity7 that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the @entity84
