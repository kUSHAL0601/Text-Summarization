-- security forces have begun removing tanks from the volatile @entity4 city of @entity5 , a sign that the tensions there could be easing
@entity9 , chairman of the @entity10 in @entity4 and @entity11 , a prominent opposition activist in @entity5 told @entity0 that tanks just inside the city are withdrawing
@entity5 has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations , including a huge anti-government demonstration on friday
president @entity19 fired the @entity5 provincial governor on saturday and security forces moved to the outskirts of the city
a fierce crackdown ensued in the area , with activists and @entity27 reporting many arrests and deaths
@entity9 said 34 people were killed tuesday and wednesday alone
he and @entity11 said the general strike called by activists several days ago continues with businesses , schools , and offices across the city closed
residents have created security barriers to protect themselves
" the city streets are deserted and it is difficult to move thorough the city because of the checkpoints set up on every corner by residents , " @entity11 said
@entity4 has denied that a military campaign was under way against @entity5 , even as human rights groups reported deaths , arrests and clashes on the outskirts of the city
" the @entity4 army did not enter and will not enter @entity5 , " a @entity4 government official told @entity0 wednesday
" the army is present at the city 's entrances to facilitate the entry of government employees who live in the @entity5 countryside and work in government offices in the city ; some people in @entity5 prevented them from entering the city by cutting off roads
" it is unclear whether @entity5 residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on friday after @entity67 prayers
the theme of the protests is " no dialogue , " a reference to the government - sponsored dialogue with the opposition members this weekend
demonstrators are calling for all opposition leaders to boycott the initiative
activists have said that , since mid-march , violence has been started by security personnel who have used brute force to break up peaceful demonstrations , but the @entity4 regime has blamed " armed groups " for the bloodshed
the city is a sensitive spot for @entity4 authorities
in 1982 , it was the scene of a brutal military crackdown targeting @entity91 by the @entity93 - dominated government of @entity94 , president @entity19 's late father
many thousands were killed , with @entity27 putting the toll at 10,000 .
