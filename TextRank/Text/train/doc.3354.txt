@entity0 -- jurors in the murder trial of @entity0 abortion doctor @entity4 ended their first day of deliberations , tuesday without a verdict
deliberations will resume wednesday morning
@entity4 , 72 , is accused of killing babies by using scissors to cut their spinal cords
authorities allege that some of the infants were born alive and viable during the sixth , seventh and eighth months of pregnancy
@entity4 originally faced first - degree murder charges in the deaths of seven babies and a count of third - degree murder in the death of @entity21 , 41
@entity22 died of an anesthetic overdose during a second - trimester abortion
judge @entity25 threw out three of the seven first - degree murder charges last week
@entity4 also is charged with conspiracy , abortion at 24 or more weeks of pregnancy , theft , corruption of minors , solicitation and other related offenses
he has pleaded not guilty
on monday , defense attorney @entity36 gave an impassioned , 2Â½ - hour closing argument disputing the prosecution 's evidence , claiming that none of the infants was killed ; rather , he said , they were already dead as a result of @entity4 administering the drug @entity45 , which can cause abortion
@entity36 , stalking the jury box , accused prosecutors of " the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system , " even adding that they are " elitist " and " racist
" @entity4 , who is @entity52 , has been accused by authorities of preying on low - income , minority women
@entity36 argued that @entity4 offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance
on tuesday , @entity25 spent just over 90 minutes giving the jurors their instructions
jurors appeared to listen intently ; @entity4 took notes , and attorneys watched the jury box
after retiring for deliberations , the jury sent back questions regarding one of the names of a patient and wanted the definition of " theft by deception
" the judge also tossed out all five abuse - of - corpse charges for storing the feet of aborted fetuses in plastic containers
@entity25 dismissed one count of infanticide , the intentional killing of an infant
@entity4 also is accused of reusing unsanitary instruments ; performing procedures in filthy rooms , including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time ; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia
nine others who worked in the west @entity0 medical office , including @entity4 's wife and sister - in - law , also were charged
also on trial is co-defendant @entity100 , 56 , who worked as a doctor at the @entity102
@entity100 , who is a medical school graduate , is charged with participating in the operation of a " corrupt organization " and " theft by deception " for operating without a license to practice medicine
meanwhile , a gag order preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media remains in place
if he is found guilty of first - degree murder , @entity4 , who is not a board - certified obstetrician or gynecologist , could be sentenced to death
@entity1 's @entity120 contributed to this report .
