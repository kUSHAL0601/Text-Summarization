-- thanks to the circular firing squad nature of the 2012 @entity5 presidential primaries , it had begun to look as if president @entity7 would coast to re-election in november
but then came along high gas prices
the recent dramatic increase in gas prices could become the issue that slows the economy , stalls the recovery and sinks the president 's chances at a second term
as a @entity5 who recognizes president @entity7 's great skill as campaigner - in - chief , i 'm shocked he has handled the issue so poorly
even most of those who agree presidents ca n't do much to lower gas prices acknowledge they must be perceived as doing everything they can to ease the suffering
sixty - five percent of @entity30 tell pollsters they disapprove of the president 's handling of gas prices
average gas prices have reached $ 3.87 nationwide , the highest ever recorded in march
the prices are expected to go even higher as the summer driving season arrives
if president @entity7 ca n't change the perception that he ca n't do anything about it , he could find himself pumping his own gas after november
the international markets are unlikely to save him , given the current unrest in the @entity46 and rising demand in @entity48 , @entity49 and elsewhere
popular opinion -- and the @entity30 economy -- could take a strong turn against him if the situation is not rectified by summer
@entity30 will not appreciate paying $ 5 per gallon or more on their vacations
those in the battleground states of @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 could be particularly annoyed
they will come to see his energy policy -- calling oil " the fuel of the past , " and slowing the permit process for drilling in the @entity70 -- as crafted to please his friends in the green movement
and while the president is set to begrudgingly fast track the southern portion of the @entity79 pipeline , he does not appear to have bought into the merits of the entire project
president @entity7 can argue that changing his policies would not dramatically increase domestic oil supplies in the short run
while this is technically correct , @entity30 are unlikely to buy the argument
as economist @entity90 and others have noted , speculators and traders , whom president @entity7 has blamed for the current crisis , respond to news of new energy exploration
for example , president @entity94 confronted a similar problem with gas prices spiking during spring and summer 2008
he responded by lifting an executive branch moratorium on oil and gas exploration in the @entity101 regions in an effort to jump - start production , and high prices subsided by fall
president @entity7 seems to be leaning toward dipping into the @entity105 , which may or may not work since that move does not actually increase production
and he has embarked on an @entity30 energy tour , highlighted by stops in three swing states , to convince voters he 's doing all he can
the @entity5 candidates , who seem never to miss an opportunity to take on the president , must seize this moment to push for an energy policy that would better serve the interests of the middle class
they should start a conversation now on how to avoid future gas price spikes
domestic energy security is one of the nation 's most critical issues
president @entity7 's own @entity124 says we will need almost as much gasoline for transportation in 20 years as we consume today
the president is right that drilling alone will not satisfy our domestic needs
and he has supported an all - of - the - above approach
but his actions have n't completely matched his words
it truly must be all of the above
it must , as @entity135 contends , tap into proven homegrown reserves in the @entity138 , in @entity139 , off both coasts and in the @entity141
it must include an all - of - the - above approach to technology as well -- including fracking , mapping and drilling -- and it must again involve building refineries
such an approach can help drive down oil prices in the short term , boost domestic energy production , reduce dependence on unstable foreign sources , create jobs and provide new revenue streams for the government
it will be environmentally responsible because production of oil under @entity30 environmental standards is among the strictest in the world
president @entity7 has pinned almost his entire re-election hopes on an economic recovery
if gas prices do n't retreat soon , @entity30 will cancel their vacations , the seasonal industries that depend on those vacations will wilt , consumer spending will slow and the administration 's hopes of showing concrete signs of an economic recovery by @entity174 will fade
in that scenario , the president could find himself out of a job -- and it will be his own fault
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .
