" that charge says @entity2 used force to restrain a woman at a fundraising event on march 6 , a prosecutor said in court tuesday
one of the misdemeanor battery charges says he kissed a woman on the lips without her consent in @entity0 @entity27 last april 6
the other misdemeanor battery charge says he grabbed a woman 's buttock at a rally last may 25 after she asked to have her picture taken with him

if @entity2 violates his probation , he could face up to six months in jail
under the plea deal , @entity2 would also have to surrender any mayoral pension benefits he accrued since the date of the first offense , march 6 , until he resigned in august , the attorney general 's office said
@entity2 was elected mayor last november after serving as a congressman for 20 years
he resigned after a total of 19 women this year accused him of offensive behavior during his tenure as mayor and as a congressman
@entity2 resigns - but says he faced ' lynch mob ' hysteria under the agreement , @entity2 also would be prohibited from ever seeking or holding public office again , the attorney general 's office said
@entity2 also would not be able to vote , serve on a jury or own a firearm while on probation
fines , court fees and restitution will be determined at his december sentencing
" this conduct was not only criminal , it was also an extreme abuse of power , " said @entity47 attorney general @entity76
" this prosecution is about consequence and accountability
no one is above the law
" @entity2 and @entity85 are @entity86
a prosecutor told the judge that the plea agreement strives for " a right balance between justice and closure
" @entity2 , also a former 10 - term @entity86 congressman , resigned from the mayor 's post in august after at least 19 women came forward publicly to accuse him of inappropriate behavior during his time as a congressman and , since 2012 , as a mayor
@entity102 blackballs @entity0 mayor the one - by - one emergence of the women accusing @entity2 of sexual harassment or other misconduct became a daily scandal for weeks that withered his political standing
numerous public officials , including all nine @entity112 members and the state 's two @entity114 senators , urged him to step down
so , too , did a majority of locals , according to polls
after the @entity112 voted 7 - 0 to accept his resignation , @entity2 spoke at a council meeting and offered a " deep apology ... to all the citizens
" " the city should not have been put through this , " the 70 - year - old mayor said
" and my own personal failures were responsible
" a short time later , though , @entity2 went on the defensive , even alleging that his ouster was " a political coup
" while admitting that his behavior toward women was inappropriate at times , he insisted that he " never sexually harassed anyone
" did @entity0 mayor target victims of military sexual assault ? in the process of " trying to establish personal relationships , " the mayor explained , " the combination of awkwardness and hubris , i think , led to behavior that many found offensive
" he added , " not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court
" " but the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob , " @entity2 said , criticizing an environment in which " rumors become allegations , allegations become facts , facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall
" blasting politicians and members of the media who " unleashed a monster , " the mayor said , " the hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo
