-- a bill moving through @entity2 is intended , on its surface at least , to do something relatively simple : crack down on the illegal pirating of movies , music and other copyrighted material
but a major online backlash has evolved , with everyone from lawmakers to web - freedom advocates to some of technology 's biggest players calling it a greedy and dangerous overreach that could have a chilling effect on free speech and innovation
@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 are among the @entity24 heavyweights who have joined the chorus against the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , which backers hope to have ready for a vote by the end of the year
its intent is to help put a stop to foreign websites that illegally post , and sometimes sell , intellectual property from the @entity34
federal law - enforcement agencies would be empowered to shut down those sites , and cut off advertising and online payments to them
" the @entity26 helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from @entity34 innovations go to @entity34 innovators , " rep. @entity40 , a @entity42 @entity41 , chairman of the powerful @entity43 and the sponsor of the plan , said when the bill was introduced last month
" the bill prevents online thieves from selling counterfeit goods in the @entity34 , expands international protections for intellectual property , and protects @entity34 consumers from dangerous counterfeit products
" its supporters include some powerful lobbying groups , including the @entity63 , the pharmaceutical industry and the @entity65
on the other side are web - freedom advocates , who were quick to say the effort goes too far
and this week , in the wake of a wednesday hearing on the plan , that discontent grew louder and more widespread
" our government is tampering with its basic structure so people will maybe buy more @entity85 movies , " says an animated video by @entity75 , the @entity76 filmmaker behind the web video series " @entity79 , " that is making the rounds online
" but @entity85 movies do n't get grassroots candidates elected
they do n't overthrow corrupt regimes , and the entire entertainment industry does n't even contribute that much to our economy
the @entity91 does all these and more
" perhaps tellingly , that video was made in response to an earlier bill proposed in the @entity95 , which has since been put on hold by its sponsor
@entity75 has since added a message at the end of the video saying the issue has " gotten much worse
" some critics fear that enforcement of the act is ill - defined and could allow federal authorities to go after sites that do n't set out to illegally broadcast or sell content
for example , advocates say , @entity108 has housed important content , like video of political unrest in places like @entity115 and @entity116 where government crackdowns had otherwise blocked media access
but @entity108 also is home , albeit against its will , to music videos , movie clips and other content posted without the intent of its creators
under @entity26 , they say , a fledgling @entity108 could have been shut down because of those posts
this week , a letter opposing the @entity43 and @entity95 bills was sent to @entity2 , signed off on by @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity22 , @entity20 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity21 and @entity136
" we support the bills ' stated goals -- providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign ' rogue ' websites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting , " the letter reads
" unfortunately , the bills as drafted would expose law - abiding @entity34 @entity91 and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities , private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of websites
" we are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry 's continued track record of innovation and job - creation , as well as to our nation 's cybersecurity
" to coincide with wednesday 's committee hearing , many websites devoted themselves to drawing attention to the debate
blog platform @entity164 blacked out images in users ' posts with a message urging users to " stop the law that will censor the internet ! " a post on @entity164 's staff blog claimed users flooded @entity43 lawmakers wednesday with 87,834 phone calls protesting the bill
the backlash seems to be spreading to the halls of @entity2
on thursday , @entity43 minority leader @entity181 , @entity182 , announced her opposition to the plan on @entity135
" need to find a better solution than # sopa # @entity190 , " she wrote , using hashtags that opponents have used to show their disapproval on the site
even @entity181 's opponents from the other side of the ideological aisle agreed with her
influential @entity182 @entity194 rep. @entity194 joined other conservative lawmakers , including presidential candidates @entity196 and @entity198 , in opposing the proposed law
" i do n't believe this bill has any chance on the @entity43 floor , " @entity194 told @entity200 on wednesday
" i think it 's way too extreme , it infringes on too many areas that our leadership will know is simply too dangerous to do in its current form
