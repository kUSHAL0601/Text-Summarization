it regularly ranks as one of public radio 's most popular shows -- including the most popular weekend program -- with about 4 million listeners
the show consists of the two brothers , who own a @entity35 , @entity36 ( " our fair city , " as they 've long called their home ) , garage , taking calls from listeners about their automobile -- and sometimes relationship -- problems
the two regularly insult one another , make each other laugh and force listeners to re-create the sounds of their car ailments on the air
the program has inspired two tv shows -- one of them , " the @entity55 , " ran for one season on @entity57 -- and at least two books .
