-- @entity1 is a 96 - year - old @entity3 - @entity2 resident of @entity4 , @entity5
she was born in a small town in northern @entity7 before women could vote and when @entity10 laws mandated racial segregation
her life has spanned nearly a century of progress : the 19th amendment extended suffrage to women , the @entity14 led to the dismantling of segregation laws , and the @entity19 outlawed overt racial discrimination in elections
mrs. @entity1 has always honored this past by voting
in 70 years , she has missed only one election , in 1960 , because a move made her miss the registration deadline
despite living through an era when @entity3 were routinely turned away from the ballot box -- and worse -- mrs. @entity1 said she " never had any problems " exercising her rights
even before the @entity19 was passed in 1965
last week @entity5 effectively prohibited her from voting because of the state 's new photo id requirement
in 2011 , republicans in @entity5 passed a law requiring all voters to show current , government - issued photo identification before voting in person
mrs. @entity1 has a social security card and a photo id issued by the @entity40 for seniors in her housing complex
when she went to the @entity43 to obtain a new photo id before the next election , she came prepared
she had her rent receipt , a copy of her lease , voter registration card and birth certificate
but under the new @entity33 law , this still was n't good enough
@entity5 refused to issue mrs. @entity1 a photo id because the last name on her birth certificate is different from her married name , the name she uses now
but she has no marriage certificate , so she can not clear up the discrepancy to @entity5 's satisfaction
and so she can not enter a voting booth and have her vote counted
in support of photo id laws , @entity33 have argued that everyone has a photo id -- a claim that mrs. @entity1 's story squarely disproves
mrs. @entity1 has proved her identity beyond a shadow of a doubt , and it 's still not enough
under this new @entity33 regime , her voting rights are entirely dependent on bureaucratic whims and one missing piece of paper
if only the @entity33 cared as much about the @entity76 , mrs. @entity1 would n't have suffered this injustice and would continue to enjoy her fundamental right to vote
mrs. @entity1 's experience is shocking , but because of an unprecedented wave of @entity33 legislation restricting ballot access across the country , this is not an isolated incident
in 2011 , @entity33 have pushed through photo id mandates , reductions of early voting and restrictions on voter registration
these measures disproportionately harm communities of color , young voters , poor voters and voters with disabilities
and all too often , they harm the elderly
throughout the @entity2 , 18 % of people age 65 and over -- more than 6 million @entity3 -- lack a current government - issued photo id
in @entity103 , which also passed a strict photo id measure , there have been numerous reports of elderly citizens waiting hours to obtain an id for voting
@entity33 have disingenuously claimed that photo id laws are necessary to prevent election fraud , but state and federal laws already do that
many states have effectively addressed the @entity33 ' concerns with alternative methods of affirming one 's identify , such as signing an affidavit attesting that you are eligible to vote
nevertheless , @entity33 legislators across the country are needlessly pursuing photo id laws , at the risk of disenfranchising millions of eligible @entity3
in @entity125 , where @entity33 are currently pushing a photo id mandate , new legislation could prevent 340,000 older @entity127 from voting -- more than the total population of @entity130
if this is how @entity33 thank the @entity133 , elderly veterans and amazing women like @entity1 , i sure hope they do n't try to take care of me when i 'm older
mrs. @entity1 has always displayed a remarkable commitment to our democracy
it is time that we do same
this weekend , we dedicate a national memorial to dr. @entity143 we may have thought that restrictions on the right to vote were behind us
but in 2011 , @entity33 leaders are more interested in protecting themselves from defeat than protecting a citizen 's right to vote
as mrs. @entity1 's experience shows us , photo id mandates simply do n't work -- unless , of course , your goal is to prevent eligible @entity3 from voting
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .
