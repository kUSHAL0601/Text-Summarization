-- as a baseball executive whose mother survived relentless domestic violence , and an advocate who worked for years to pass the @entity7 , we want to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that life - saving bill , signed into law on september 13 , 1994
this groundbreaking law was the first to put the full force of the federal government into efforts to stop violence against women and help victims
it reshaped our criminal justice system , ushered in training for law enforcement and judges , and enhanced a life - saving national network of services and supports that has saved countless lives
over time , the law became a catalyst for broader , badly needed change
in fact , according to the @entity30 , intimate partner violence has dropped 64 % since the @entity7 was passed 20 years ago
now that 's something we can all be proud of
but frankly , the media paid little attention to the bill that was introduced by then - senator @entity37 , and signed into law by president @entity39 in 1994
they were too busy clamoring over the story about a high - profile @entity43 football hero named @entity44
@entity44 had a history of domestic violence and was on trial for the murder of his wife and friend
he was acquitted in that famous trial
but the @entity44 story had a silver lining : it led to tens of thousands of women around the country feeling empowered to reveal their own stories of abuse
and it gave activists an opportunity to rally their communities and demand more services and protections for victims and survivors
it took the topic of domestic violence from the back page to the front page and to the top of the newscast -- everywhere
it 's ironic , then , that 20 years later , the nation would be so laser - focused on the story of another football hero
in this case , it 's the story of @entity83 player @entity82 that is dominating our conversations , and despite the damage done , there is a positive repercussion worth noting : again , thousands of people are sharing personal statements and encouragements around the issue of domestic violence
@entity43 toughens domestic violence policy with six - game bans there 's even a hashtag campaign , # whyistayed
we know from experience , that staying in the public conversation is often the precursor to making true and lasting change
and we 're hopeful that the @entity43 , and other professional sports leagues are recognizing that now is the time for a strong , enforceable policies that will not tolerate domestic violence or sexual assault
the first @entity7 did n't do nearly enough for the children who grow up in homes in which there is violence
it did n't do enough to help college students and other victims of rape , stalking and sexual assault
it did n't do enough for minority , immigrant and disabled communities , and populations with special needs
and it did n't do enough to promote prevention
@entity43 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story ' with each subsequent re-authorization of the law , progress has been made -- but there 's much more to do
we 're convinced the country can finish the job
vice president @entity37 poured his heart and soul into passing the @entity7 20 years ago and his commitment has never wavered
he was its proudest champion , winning crucial support on both sides of the political aisle
we still need him , and we still need a bipartisan group of dedicated congressional champions
today , we both work with key federal agencies , large philanthropies , leading corporations and other partners that share our mission to finish what the @entity7 started
we need every one of them
there 's still much too much violence against women , and our nation pays a huge price
we need to continue the progress for adult women , heal kids who are hurt , and show perpetrators that they have to be accountable for their actions
we need to engage the public and make men part of the solution
passage of the @entity7 was a triumph of bipartisanship , and a moment in time when lawmakers had the clarity and courage to recognize that they could make an enormous difference on a problem affecting every community
it was a huge step forward for the country
twenty years later , we should cherish and take enormous pride in this achievement -- and finish the job
join us on @entity182 / @entity181 .
