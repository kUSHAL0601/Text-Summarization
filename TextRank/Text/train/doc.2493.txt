-- @entity3 was not mentally incapacitated when he shot his girlfriend to death , a psychiatric assessment of the athlete has found
the results of the assessment were revealed in court monday when the @entity11 sprinter 's trial resumed after a monthlong break for the evaluation
according to the findings by an independent panel of doctors , @entity3 did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the " time of the commission of the offense that would have rendered him criminally not responsible of the offenses charged
" the report added that " mr. @entity3 was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act
" had the doctors deemed @entity3 mentally incapacitated during the shooting , the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness
@entity3 , 27 , is accused of murdering his girlfriend , 29 - year - old model and law school graduate @entity34 , in his home in february 2013
@entity3 admits shooting @entity34 through a closed door , killing her , but has told the court in @entity38 , @entity39 , that he mistook her for an intruder
he has pleaded not guilty
the state says @entity3 argued with @entity34 before killing her
on may 20 , trial judge @entity42 ordered @entity3 to report for a psychiatric evaluation to establish whether he was criminally responsible for his actions
the prosecution and defense said they accepted the report 's findings
the defense has resumed its case
psychiatrist 's testimony @entity3 ' psychiatric testing last month was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who said the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant , stemming partly from the amputation his lower legs
the disorder meant @entity3 had " excessive " concerns about security and felt threatened even when , objectively , he was not , dr. @entity62 testified on may 12
after @entity62 's testimony , prosecutor @entity63 filed a motion asking the judge to require psychiatric tests , arguing that if there was any chance the defendant 's mental health was an issue , the court must " err on the side of caution
" @entity63 's extremely unusual move was essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or " capacity " defense even though the athlete 's legal team is not mounting one , @entity0 legal analyst @entity76 said
@entity76 said @entity63 appeared to be placing a high - stakes bet that experts would disagree with @entity62 's evidence
@entity3 ' lead defense lawyer , @entity88 , argued against the tests , describing @entity63 's reading of the law as " unfortunate
" but @entity42 ordered the evaluation , saying the defense 's act of putting a psychiatrist on the stand had raised the question of the athlete 's mental health
testing began on may 26
light and balance when court resumed monday , the defense called @entity3 ' orthopedic surgeon dr. @entity105 as a witness
@entity105 described the limitations of @entity3 ' mobility , based on his examination of the athlete and @entity3 ' own description
in his cross-examination , @entity63 focused on the effect of light on @entity3 ' balance
in his affidavit , @entity3 said he had rushed to the bathroom on stumps with a pistol after hearing a noise
he said he had been too scared to turn the lights on
" it was pitch dark in the bedroom , and i thought @entity34 was in bed
" @entity63 suggested to @entity126 that it would have been " highly unlikely " that @entity3 would have been able to walk on his stumps without falling if it had been pitch black in the bedroom , given the objects in it
" if it was indeed pitch dark , that is so , " @entity105 replied
@entity88 referred to @entity3 ' evidence that there had been slight illumination
" the moment there is light available , he will be able to use his vision to balance , " @entity105 said , agreeing that if @entity3 had known the objects in his room , that would also have helped protect him from falling
sound of screams acoustic engineer @entity147 was the second witness to take the stand monday
he told court that " typically , " one can differentiate between male and female screams , but not without exception
previous witnesses have described hearing a woman 's screams between shots the night @entity34 died , but the defense has argued that @entity3 sounds " like a woman screaming " when he 's anxious
@entity147 said it would be " impossible " to replicate the " highly complex sound transmission " from @entity3 ' house the night he killed @entity34
he explained how different variables could affect the transmission
verdict at the trial 's conclusion , @entity42 will have to decide whether @entity3 genuinely made a mistake or killed @entity34 intentionally
if she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder , she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison and possibly life
@entity39 does not have the death penalty
if @entity42 accepts that @entity3 did not know @entity34 was the person he was shooting at , she could find him guilty of culpable homicide , a lesser charge than murder , or acquit him , according to @entity0 legal analyst @entity76
a verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at @entity42 's discretion
