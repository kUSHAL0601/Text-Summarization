@entity0 -- can liberals ever be happy ? i keep asking myself this question as i hear an increasing number complaining about president @entity6
there seems to be a @entity9 chorus of liberal whining : " i 'm disappointed by him
" " i expected more
" " i thought he would be different
" earlier this week , singer @entity13 , a vocal 2008 @entity6 supporter , lamented that president @entity6 is " ... just as beholden to the people who put him in office as any of the @entity17 would be
" @entity18 , who had very publicly supported @entity6 in 2008 , has now very publicly attacked president @entity6
@entity18 even went so far as to heap praise on former president @entity20 , saying : " i would kiss @entity20 on the mouth " in appreciation for his work fighting @entity24 in @entity25
although @entity18 did note his kiss of @entity20 would be limited to : " three seconds , no tongue
" others turning on @entity6 include @entity29 , comedian / actor @entity30 , and even the distinguished professor @entity31 , who called @entity6 : " a black mascot of @entity34 oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats
" a new @entity37 released this week found that president @entity6 's support among liberals was at its lowest point in seven months , although it 's still a solid majority of 70 %
what 's clear is that the liberals speaking out do n't want a president , they want a king
albeit a liberal king -- but still a king , who would be unrestrained by @entity47 as well as the checks and balances enshrined in our @entity50
these disenchanted liberals apparently wanted @entity6 -- upon taking office -- to have instantly transformed every campaign promise into law by the simple wave of a pen
or maybe they would have preferred @entity6 to have walked out onto a @entity59 balcony where , in a scene reminiscent of the musical " @entity61 , " he would be greeted by adoring throngs waiting below , and on the spot , declare that all his ideas were now the law of the land
but here 's the problem
@entity6 is not a king , he 's the president of the @entity71
for those who may have forgotten the " @entity79 " cartoon of " how a bill becomes a law , " @entity47 needs to first pass the bill before it has any chance of becoming a law
our @entity80 set up a governmental structure that requires the president to engage in give and take with the legislative branch
of course , if the @entity80 could see the current state of our dysfunctional @entity47 , they may have instead chosen a dictatorship
but they did n't , instead drafting a system to guard us against tyranny
consequently , president @entity6 is required to navigate through myriad vested interests that exercise influence on the 535 members of @entity47
keep in mind most of @entity47 was in office before president @entity6 was elected and most will be there when he leaves
powerful members of @entity47 are like summer camp counselors and @entity6 is like the camper
he will only be there a relatively short amount of time , but they will remain to run the camp
thus , as opposed to a king , a president has to engage in activity that some on the left view as a dirty word
that wicked word is : compromise
in fairness , there are many on the far right who also disdain compromise
who can forget @entity121 darling @entity119 's statement : " ... people are sick and tired of this word in @entity124 : compromise
this is why nothing ever gets done
" ( this is amazing logic , because you would normally think it was the lack of compromise that prevents things from getting done in @entity124
) to me , the liberals who are so very disappointed with president @entity6 either had unrealistic expectations for him , viewing him as a messianic figure who would magically solve all of our nation 's woes , or simply refuse to grasp the reality of our @entity71 political system
in either case , the answer is : the problem is not @entity6 , it 's you
being president requires some degree of compromise due to the very nature of our government
that is the way it has been for more than 200 years
while president @entity6 may be far from perfect -- and , i , too , have been disappointed with some of his decisions -- i certainly prefer him to a king
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .
