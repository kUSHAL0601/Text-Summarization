editor 's note : @entity2 is a magazine editor and the creator of @entity4 , an @entity6 fashion app for @entity7 and @entity8
his @entity10 handle is @ sethporges
( @entity12 ) -- app appeal is obvious
the barrier to entry ? so low ! the upshot of producing the next @entity17 or beer - chug simulator ? so high ! @entity23 , with just a small investment of time and cash , it 's not hard for would - be mobile moguls to turn a concept into a steady stream of cash
and thanks to today 's app stores , it 's never been easier to try your hand at becoming the next tech tycoon
here 's ( almost ) everything you need to know before you get started on your own app -- and what i wish i knew before i got into the game
what does it cost to make an app ? if you 're new to the app game , prepare for some sticker shock
making an app will cost you , at the very minimum , around $ 10,000
this is for a super-simple program — none of that fancy enterprise or social networking jibber - jabber
even still , any app worth its weight in code will likely cost you closer to $ 20,000
unless you have some basic design skills , you 'll need to enlist the help of both a programmer and a designer
and these guys ai n't cheap — particularly programmers who , thanks to a pronounced shortage of qualified coders , can pretty much name their prices
( a suggestion for those low on funds : find some creative way to come up with the cash
i funded my app through @entity72 income
) you can try to offload some of your costs by offering your guys equity ; on the other hand , everybody tries to get free ( or close to free ) apps by offering developers equity
so unless you can really sell them on the strength of your idea ( or bring something totally rad to the table , such as a celebrity ) , you better be prepared to pony up some cash
of course , adding in some equity as a bonus is never a bad idea , so you 'll probably want to dish out some shares too
this basic supply / demand dynamic also means that many developers ask for some pretty insane terms
some demand deals that involve a huge upfront payment in exchange for a few weeks ( or even just days ) of work
and if a decent developer is n't already working full time , it 's not unreasonable to assume he 's at least a little commitment - averse
so , if you 're serious about making something beyond a quickie cash grab , find a developer you are sure will stay with the project for updates , and not abandon it the second it hits the store
and get it all in writing
if you do n't want to hire a lawyer , find a boilerplate contract online or get one from somebody else who 's gone through the process , and just swap in your names and numbers
if you can , you 'll also want to work with people who are local to you -- or at least with people who are willing to join you for regular @entity121 chats or @entity122
i had weekly beer summits with my coder and designer , which proved super helpful as we continued to fine - tune our app well into its development
one more unavoidable cost : @entity131 charges $ 100 per year to hold onto a developer 's account ( which you need to publish your app )
so be sure to reserve an extra @entity135 for your budget
what should you charge for your app ? i would consider starting one 's app at or near $ 1.99
it 's premium price , but it 's also immensely satisfying to get more than a buck per download after @entity131 takes away its 30 %
and , as with most things , it 's a lot easier to lower the price later than it is to raise it
during the holiday period , we briefly played around with a special promotion that dropped our app price to $ 0.99
predictably , this spiked our downloads , but it did n't actually raise our total revenue
even on @entity158 -- the single biggest download day for just about everybody — our revenue was actually higher a week or so later , once we had raised the price back to $ 1.99
the obvious exception : if your primary business model involves in - app purchases , ads or the like , you 'll probably want to give your app away for free
after all , a quick glance at @entity131 's top grossing charts shows a whole bunch of free apps
when will you get paid ? @entity131 sends you cash one month at a time , up to 45 days after the month has ended
so , if your app goes live in january , you can expect your first kickback sometime in early march
oh , and @entity131 only pays you if your earned amount totals at least $ 150 , so you may have to wait before getting your first payment
keep in mind , @entity131 only pays you through direct deposit
how do you write your @entity177 description ? do n't try to rock the boat here
take a look at a bunch of hit apps , and crib their formats
if it works for them , it 'll work for you
typically , this involves a quickie intro statement , press blurbs and a list of your key features
then add some screenshots ( the most interesting ones first ) and call it a day
what 's the best way to beta test ? getting an unreleased app onto your friends ' iphones is n't the easiest thing in the world
my developer and i are in total agreement that the best method is a program called @entity208 , which makes it very easy to send build updates to registered devices , over the air
what happens when you get featured on @entity177 ? getting featured on @entity177 is obviously awesome , but what exactly does it get you ? when @entity131 included our app on its featured lists , we enjoyed a predictable flow of downloads almost identical in volume every single day we were parked there
especially fascinating , the " @entity226 " list gave us almost exactly twice as many daily downloads as the " what 's @entity230 " list
i 'm assuming this is because , when you tap the " featured " tab on the " @entity236 " app , " @entity226 " pops up by default
how do you get press ? as a longtime tech writer , the main advice i can give you in your pursuit for press is that less is more
if you think a site or publication would be into your app , do n't e-mail the entire staff or the big boss — just find the writer who covers your category , briefly summarize your app in an email , and attach a download code ( @entity131 gives you 50 for every update )
smaller sites may be more responsive than the big guys , and if you build up enough buzz , you can rest assured that the majors will come knocking
if a journalist does n't get back to you , move on
and do n't even touch that phone or personal e-mail address ( unless that person is a freelancer ) -- writers hate nothing more than phone or personal - inbox press pitches
consider also producing an embeddable @entity268 or @entity269 ad of some sort
not only does this provide one more avenue for people to stumble upon your app , but it also gives bloggers something alive and colorful to toss into posts , which could increase the chances that they 'll write about you
keep it simple , and preferably , well under two minutes
and do n't forget to promote over @entity10 , @entity281 , etc. 8
how do you avoid the spam ? within days of hitting the @entity236 , expect whichever email you linked to your @entity177 developer 's account to be pounded with spam
most try to lure you into ponying over money in exchange for positive reviews , under the guise of " mobile marketing
" let 's put it this way : if you do n't regularly buy @entity297 pills online , then you probably should n't give cash to these guys
of course , if you 're smart enough to make an app , you 're smart enough to know this already
