-- on monday , as he remained hospitalized for injuries incurred during a massive manhunt and a pair of shootouts last week , @entity1 heard from his hospital bed his @entity8 rights being read , and then he heard read the federal charges now filed against him in connection with the @entity12 bombings
the 19 - year - old faces charges of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death , and of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death
what follows is a chronology produced by @entity25 special agent @entity24 , who is part of a @entity28 counterterrorism squad and who based his re-telling of events on crime scene photographs and video , as well information he gleaned from other officers as well as from his own involvement in the case
read the complaint @entity24 said he is not divulging all of the details he has , just what is necessary to establish the following
as told via the criminal complaint : at 2:38 p.m. on monday , april 15 , roughly 11 minutes prior to the first blast , @entity43 and @entity1 are caught on camera turning onto @entity46 , the thoroughfare where the finish line is located
@entity48 is wearing a baseball cap , sunglasses , a white shirt , dark coat and tan pants
his little brother is wearing a gray hoodie , a black jacket and dark pants
he also has a white baseball cap , turned backward on his head
the pair walks east , toward the @entity12 finish line , @entity48 in front of @entity1 , wearing a knapsack on his back
5 key questions the two are seen standing about a half - block from @entity67 , the site of the second explosion , at about 2:41 p.m. a minute later , @entity48 begins walking toward the finish line again
he still has his knapsack
@entity1 begins walking toward the finish line at about 2:45 p.m. he has his right thumb hooked under his backpack strap and there 's a phone in his left hand
he stops in front of @entity67
he 's near the metal barricades separating spectators from the marathon contestants , standing with his back to the cameras
" he then can be seen apparently slipping his knapsack onto the ground
a photograph taken from the opposite side of the street shows the knapsack on the ground at ( @entity1 's ) feet
" @entity1 stays at this location for about four minutes , looking at his cell phone and " once appearing to take a picture with it
" about 30 seconds before the first blast , he lifts the phone to his head and speaks for about 18 seconds
he finishes the call , and the first explosion goes off within seconds
" virtually " everyone along @entity46 turns toward the finish line , " in apparent bewilderment and alarm , " but not @entity1
" he glances to the east and then calmly but rapidly begins moving to the west , away from the direction of the finish line
he walks away without his knapsack , having left it on the ground where he had been standing
@entity108 reveals clues to older @entity28 brother 's trip to @entity112 " approximately 10 seconds later , an explosion occurs in the location where ( @entity1 ) had placed his knapsack
" like @entity48 's bag , the knapsack is placed along a metal barrier
it 's about a block from the first explosion
subsequent investigation shows that both bombs used in the marathon attack were " low - grade explosives that were housed in pressure cookers
" the pressure cookers contained nails and bbs , and the bombs had " green - colored hobby fuse
" on thursday , the @entity25 distributes photos and videos of the brothers , which are widely broadcast by media outlets
just before midnight , a man is sitting in his car on a road in @entity138 when a man taps on the passenger - side window
the driver rolls down the window , and the man lets himself into the car , points a firearm and says , " did you hear about the @entity28 explosion ? ... i did that
" he then shows the driver that his gun is loaded
" i am serious , " the man says before forcing the victim to drive to another location where they pick up a second man
the armed man takes the driver 's keys and sits in the driver 's seat , while the kidnapped man moves to the passenger seat
the second man enters the back seat , and he and the driver begin talking in a foreign language
they begin driving , and the man with the gun demands money
he is given $ 45 but wants more and demands an atm card and password
they go to an atm machine , where the men attempt to get money , before going to a gas station , where the captive man escapes
in runners ' tent and @entity181 , a rush to save limbs and lives police later locate the stolen vehicle in @entity187 , a suburb west of the city , and give chase
as they attempt to elude law enforcement , the @entity1 brothers throw two small bombs out of the car
a gunfight ensues , and @entity43 is severely injured and left at the scene , while his brother escapes
police later find the car abandoned with an " intact low - grade explosive device " inside
federal agents recover two more bombs at the site of the shootout
the bombs resemble those used in the marathon bombings
one even utilizes the same brand of pressure cooker
on friday evening , police learn that an individual is inside a covered boat in @entity187
after a shootout , police apprehend the man and search him
he has a university id card , credit cards and other forms of ids which say he is @entity1
due to wounds in his head , neck , legs and hand , he is transported to a hospital
on sunday , police search @entity1 's dormitory room and recover a " large pyrotechnic " as well as a black jacket and white hat similar to the one @entity1 is seen wearing just before the explosions at the marathon .
