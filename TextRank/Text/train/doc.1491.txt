if you were hoping to be done with winter , @entity0 had some good news for you -- spring is on the way
after the groundhog was summoned from his burrow at the @entity8 's knob hill in @entity9 , @entity10 , observers proclaimed that " the prognosticator of all prognosticators " had not seen his shadow
meanwhile , at @entity17 's @entity16 , fellow groundhog @entity14 also did n't see his shadow , agreeing that an early spring was on its way
but @entity19 , a @entity21 groundhog , saw his shadow , signaling six more weeks of winter
@entity9 's celebration goes back 127 years
the tradition goes back to medieval times when there was a superstition that all hibernating animals emerged from their caves and dens to check the weather on @entity31 , which is halfway between the winter solstice in december and the vernal equinox in march
if the animals saw their shadows , winter would go on for another six weeks , and they could go back to sleep , according to the tradition
much of the @entity37 has seen extreme highs and lows in temperatures in recent weeks , taking folks from shorts and t - shirt weather to conditions that require heavy coats and gloves
here 's what @entity0 indicated in the last few years , according to @entity48 : 2012 : " many shadows do i see , six more weeks of winter it must be
" 2011 : " no shadow , spring is near ! " 2010 : " @entity0 saw his shadow and told his prediction to new @entity55 president @entity54
" 2009 : " @entity0 saw his shadow and @entity55 president @entity56 completed his final interpretation and retired at @entity0
it was 7:26 a.m. " 2008 : " it was 29 degrees
in front of one of the largest crowds ever at @entity63 's
