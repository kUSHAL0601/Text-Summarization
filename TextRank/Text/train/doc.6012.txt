-- @entity1 has always had a rich and fruitful relationship with the sea
a trade gateway linking east and west , the modern city can still show travelers glimpses of its long maritime history
now the @entity12 capital , it was initially settled as the port of @entity14 by the @entity15 around the fifth century and was designed to develop a vibrant sea trade for the realm
the " coconut of @entity25 " ( the port 's name translated from @entity28 ) soon flourished and attracted the attention of other maritime - invested nations including the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23
to this day , you can still see the influence of the @entity22 colonialists in the architecture of many of the buildings in the old city
today , @entity36 is an independent republic that has become a melting pot of cultures and people
nicknamed by travelers as the " @entity42 " ( a pungent - smelling but sweet - tasting local fruit ) , the modern metropolis of @entity1 is a swelteringly smoggy city bursting at the seams with people
watch : @entity1 's maritime history its moniker is probably a good description of the city
it may not be everyone 's idea of a typical vacation spot -- some portions of the city are grungy , dilapidated streets with scruffy slums
but underneath the seemingly overpopulated , polluted exterior lies a vibrant city rich in history and eclectic tourism options
here are our top picks for tourists wanting to sample @entity1 's maritime heritage
often missed by vacationers , the historic harbor of @entity14 sits at the mouth of the @entity70
the original settlement is a fantastic insight into the city 's history and is home to what is said to be the world 's last wind - powered seafaring trade fleet
walk amongst the traditional pinisi ships -- simple but sturdy wooden vessels -- that once provided trade from @entity36 to @entity82 and @entity83
climb up @entity84 and gaze upon the beautiful views from the top
literally meaning " @entity88 " in @entity36 ( the country 's native tongue ) , @entity87 sits at the end of @entity14 harbor
although the market now sells all types of wares , @entity12 fishermen still gather here daily to sell their catch
the best time to visit and join locals purchasing the best goods is in the morning before it gets too hot and the smell of fish becomes overwhelming
in numbers : the world 's shipping industry nearby , you can also see traditional kampung houses ( dwellings on stilts ) where local families live
do n't be shy and say hello to the incredibly friendly and welcoming folks that reside next to the market
a short distance from @entity115 are several repurposed @entity117 warehouses , which now operate as @entity118
today , the museum lets you step back in time through the country 's nautical past and emphasizes how important the sea still is to the economy of present - day @entity36
on display are beautifully decorated fishing boats and pinisi schooners as well as shipbuilding tools and explanations of @entity12 folklore and maritime traditions
steering away from the old harbor , visit the @entity133 ( @entity135 ) area
in the 16th century , the @entity22 settled in @entity36 -- renaming @entity1 " @entity135 " -- after seeing a high demand for the country 's spices
it is in the popular @entity140 that tourists can see the influence left by @entity36 's former colonists
the buildings surrounding @entity145 have distinct @entity22 facades and architectural elements
stroll down roads lined with stalls , street acts and tourists to visit the @entity152 , @entity153 and the @entity154 and ceramics
outside the @entity156 sits @entity157 -- a disused @entity21 cannon that is believed to bring fertility to women who touch it
and a few blocks west of @entity145 is the @entity163 , with its historical @entity22 drawbridge , @entity166 , rising over the waterway
no longer operational , in the past the drawbridge was built to connect the @entity22 and @entity23 forts stationed on each side of the canal
finally , end your visit to @entity1 by visiting the @entity174 ( known locally as " @entity174 " ) in the center of @entity176
it was erected in the 1960s as a tribute to @entity12 independence and today stands as a reminder of @entity1 's vibrant and multicultural history .
