the @entity1 holiday is usually observed with a smattering of parades in a few cities and discount sales from retailers
but this year , people in @entity8 will observe the man who discovered @entity10 , up close and personal
the art installation " discovering @entity15 " takes the form of a modern @entity8 living room surrounding the 13 - foot marble statue of @entity15
the statue , which has stood on a granite podium high above the middle of a @entity20 traffic circle for the past 120 years , has until now only been able to be viewed from afar , unless you were a pigeon
the exhibit , conceived by the @entity24 artist @entity23 and backed by the @entity25 , is an 800 - square - foot replica of a contemporary living room that is suspended 70 feet in the air supported by scaffolding
" the project is really about transforming an object that already exists , a monument that 's been here in @entity8 for 120 years , " said @entity30 , director and curator of the @entity25 , " and giving people a chance to experience it in a completely new way to have in this case , a much more intimate experience
" the statue , which was crafted by @entity43 in 1892 , seemingly stands on a coffee table and is surrounded by several comfy chairs , sofas , a bookcase and flat screen television
unlike a usual " no touch " policy at an art exhibit , visitors are free to lounge on the furniture for a good look at the monument
the wallpaper covering the walls was designed by the artist and features iconic @entity10 pop culture figures , such as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62
@entity23 has done several such exhibits around the world by taking a usually inaccessible object and creating a living space around it for visitors
" i did n't choose @entity15 as a figure
i chose this sculpture as a visual object and @entity73 as a place , " the artist said
and what a place it is for those lucky enough to secure a spot and willing to climb six flights of stairs
from the windows of the living room , one can see million dollar views of @entity84 as well as @entity85 and downtown @entity20
" the view you get here is extraordinary
you actually sense the fact that @entity73 is the center of this nexus of @entity8 , " @entity30 said
but not everyone thinks the exhibit is such a wonderful endeavor
@entity96 , chairman of the @entity97 , commented on the project before it opened
" @entity15 was a man of the @entity101 , an exemplar of that civilization
this is not art. if it 's his particular vision , it 's a skewed vision , so i , again with due respect to mr. @entity23 , i think he stumbled on his project
" one famous @entity8 disagrees
" i 've been living in this city since 1966
@entity73 has always been there , but you do n't look up
you ca n't see it , it 's so high , " mayor @entity115 told reporters
" for you and i , this is the first and only chance you 're probably going to have in your whole life
" the artist was asked by the @entity25 two years ago to do a project in the city , and he walked all around visiting different sites until he settled on @entity73 statue
" it 's not my intention to say something about @entity15 ; rather , i want to change the sculpture from public sculpture into a completely different thing , " @entity23 said
the exhibit opened on september 20 and will run through november 18
visitors can obtain free passes by signing up at the @entity25 's website
each pass grants access to the exhibition for up to 30 minutes
once the exhibition is over , the monument will go through a restoration
the pigeons will have to wait a little bit longer to see their old buddy @entity145
