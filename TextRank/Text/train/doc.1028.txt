-- major international hotel chains are increasingly rolling out thousands of new rooms in @entity4 's business hotspots , keen to expand their footprint on the continent 's burgeoning economies
from @entity10 and @entity11 to @entity12 and @entity13 , the world 's best known hoteliers are targeting @entity4 's growing urban centers to benefit from a rising number of business travelers and a huge undersupply in available rooms
" there 's a growing demand in those capital cities because they are the centers of business , of government and of commerce -- all of which have hospitality needs , " says @entity19 , senior vice president of development for @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity4
" we have a very bullish feel for these markets and we are very excited about the opportunity @entity4 presents , " he adds
" i think that for the next 20 years we are going to have our hands full with opportunity

@entity43 , @entity45 vice president for @entity4 and @entity46 , says it is @entity4 's potential to offset the sluggishness in more developed markets that 's appealing to global players
" what has really happened is that post the economic crash in 2008/2009 , the rest of the world has really woken up to @entity4 , " says @entity43
" there 's been such good news coming out of @entity4 from a gdp growth point of view ; better telecommunications ; improved security ; political stability ; and improved airlift , " he adds
" it 's really become a sort of new scramble back into @entity4

and whilst both international and intra-regional travel are on the up , partly thanks to @entity4 's natural resources boom , a shortage of rooms is prompting hoteliers to turn their attention to a continent ignored for decades
business travel according to a recent survey by @entity10 - based consultancy @entity85 , some 40,000 new rooms in 207 hotels are planned in the continent 's under - served cities , up almost one third compared to 2011
@entity20 , which operates nearly 11,000 rooms in 37 properties in @entity4 , says it has some 5,200 rooms and 17 hotels in the pipeline across the continent
@entity45 , which recently opened a @entity96 in @entity97 , its eighth hotel in @entity98 and 49th in the continent , is targeting 12 new hotel deals this year
@entity101 group @entity100 , owner of the @entity104 and @entity105 brands , has some 5,000 rooms in the pipeline , according to the @entity85 survey
" the vast majority of those hotels are business - oriented , " explains @entity108 , managing director of @entity85
" if you look at where those hotel chains are primarily going , it 's the capital cities or the major commercial cities of @entity4 where the business traveler is going , " he adds
yet , it 's not only the brands at the higher ends of the market that are keen to tap @entity4 's promise
in late march , pan-african conglomerate @entity123 teamed up with @entity125 's @entity124 to open their first @entity4 - based low budget hotel in @entity13 's central business district

" what 's driving us is genuine trade and business in the continent , " explains @entity132
" if you 're going to a city center like @entity12 , we want to be where the taxi rank is ; where the market is -- unlike the competition who want to be , if you like , in the beautiful parts of the city , " he adds
" we will sacrifice this for economic drivers -- we want the trade and we want to be where you want to do business
" ' real challenges ' still , international hoteliers have to overcome several infrastructure and logistics obstacles in their bid to plant their flags across the continent
@entity132 says hotels often have to be self - sustained , depending on satellite connectivity for fast wi - fi and generators for back up power , as well as having to provide their own clean water
" these are real challenges for us today , " he says
analysts also say that companies can face big delays during the construction process due to poor workmanship and a shortage of professional skills
bureaucracy and corruption can often be a problem too , especially when it comes to importing materials that are not available locally
quick returns yet , despite these hurdles , hotel groups remain very positive about their future in @entity4 as the continued rise in demand and undersupply in hotel rooms offer strong occupancy rates and high profitability margins in short periods of time
" these challenges we face , we quickly forget about them the day the hotel opens , " says @entity43
" normally , we would say the hotel takes 1,000 days from the day it opens to stabilize but in a lot of these @entity205 markets it can take a couple of months to stabilize because of the high demand for hotels
" it 's fascinating when you look at the change and opportunity on the continent and just what it represents , " he says .
