-- @entity3 @entity2 president @entity1 has spoken about @entity5 's absence from @entity7 's squad that faced @entity8 on wednesday , claiming it was a disciplinary measure
media reports speculated that @entity5 was omitted from the side that beat @entity8 2 - 1 in @entity12 as a favor to his club side @entity14 , ahead of this weekend 's crucial @entity17 derby against @entity18
but @entity1 admitted to a radio station that @entity5 was left out as a punishment for his attitude in missing last year 's friendly against @entity22 in @entity23 , only to play for @entity14 against @entity24 just four days later -- scoring twice in the match
@entity1 told @entity26 : " @entity5 's absence was because of his attitude when he did n't come to play against @entity22 and shortly after this he took the field for his club
" that attitude did n't go down well with the coaching staff , it was a lot easier to tell us that he did n't want to come
" however , @entity1 was quick to point out that @entity5 was not left out because of his close friendship with former @entity37 manager @entity36
" @entity5 's absence has nothing to do with @entity36 , we can not go down that road , '' he added
'' i want to leave that crystal clear
