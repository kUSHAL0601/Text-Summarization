-- more than 500 veterans in @entity2 are being contacted by a clinic where they may have been exposed to hepatitis and @entity5 during routine dental work , according to @entity8 communications officer @entity7
the @entity11 , @entity2 , @entity10 clinic is contacting 535 veterans who received treatment during an 18 - year period from a dentist who admitted to not washing his hands or changing gloves between patients
there are 100 to 130 additional patient records still to review , according to @entity7
" we 're taking a very aggressive approach and a well - planned intervention to make sure that we 're contacting these folks , " @entity7 said
by tuesday evening , 436 of the 535 patients had been contacted by phone , letters and visits to shelters , according to @entity7
individuals sought by the center are known to have been treated directly by the clinician between january 1 , 1992 , and july 28 , 2010 , according to a release by the medical center
the center is offering free tests to those involved and the clinic will provide all necessary care and treatment without charge should a veteran test positive for the viruses , @entity7 said
" the encouragement to get tested is strictly a precautionary measure , " @entity7 said
" it 's a very low risk that there 's any potential contamination
" while @entity7 said the testing stemmed from " invasive procedures ... done by one single clinician , " he did not identify that clinician and he did not release specifics about the clinician 's health
@entity7 said the clinic is taking full accountability for those involved , whom he calls , " our nation 's heroes
" last year the clinic closed for a month for " re-education on infection control standards " for the staff , @entity7 said
veterans could still receive care at other facilities , @entity7 said
the dentist , who is currently still on staff but handling non-clinical duties , self - reported himself during an internal inspection
an investigation is now underway involving reports that other workers at the clinic brought the dentist 's hygiene to the attention of the center , concerns that @entity7 said were valid
the center is taking an " ongoing in - depth look at a lot of aspects surrounding the allegations , " @entity7 said
" when someone brings those things to your attention , " @entity7 said , " you need to review what practices are happening
" more information and a list of labs in contractual agreement with the @entity11 center is available by calling the @entity10 's hotline at 1 - 877 - 424 - 8214 .
