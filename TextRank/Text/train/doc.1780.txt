-- @entity1 has exchanged " initial thoughts " with @entity1 's top clubs about revamping its two major competitions
one idea up for discussion is to double the @entity7 in size to include 64 teams as part of a proposal which would see the second - tier @entity12 scrapped
" we exchanged initial thoughts , but the discussions are to follow , " a spokesman for the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , which represents 207 @entity20 clubs , told @entity0 in a statement
" for the time being there 's nothing concrete
" as a principle , @entity18 is happy with the competition structure as it is , " added the spokesman
" however , we are open to discuss changes or improvements in light of the 2015 - 18 competition cycle
we will get together with @entity1 at some point to discuss
" the @entity12 has become very much the poorer relation of the two competitions with @entity1 's governing body earning about Â £ 800m more from the @entity7
and while @entity35 made Â £ 49m by winning the @entity7 in 2012 , @entity12 winners @entity34 earned just Â £ 8.5m in prize money
" we 're discussing it , " @entity1 president @entity37 told @entity39 newspaper @entity38
" we will make a decision in 2014
" there is an ongoing debate to determine what form the @entity20 competitions will have between 2015 and 2018
" formerly known as the the @entity12 , the @entity12 has been much - maligned since it was rebranded in 2009
a prolonged qualification process means a team reaching the @entity12 final might have played as many as 20 games , in addition to domestic fixtures
breakaway " @entity52 " often high - profile clubs take the decision to play second - string teams in the competition , preferring to focus on their domestic league and the chance of qualifying for the @entity7
earlier this season , @entity1 asked managers and players to refer to the @entity12 as " prestigious " , " rich in heritage " and " dramatic "
in the @entity38 interview , former @entity39 international @entity37 also dismissed the idea of @entity1 's biggest football clubs , such as @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , forming a breakaway " @entity52 "
" it 's a question that is regularly brought up , " said the @entity1 president
" i ca n't see how it could work outside the @entity1 framework
who will referee them ? in what stadiums will they play ? " meanwhile @entity80 chief executive @entity79 is to join the @entity18 's executive board after @entity82 , ceo of the @entity85 ' @entity84 rivals , decided to stand down from the @entity20 club organization
@entity79 will replace @entity87 on the @entity1 professional @entity88 , with the @entity70 executive concentrating on his candidacy for election to the @entity1 @entity93 in the coming year
" i am pleased to welcome @entity79 on the @entity18 executive board , " @entity18 chairman @entity94 said in a statement
" his experience and distinct football knowledge will add a lot of value to @entity18 and @entity20 club football as a whole , " added the @entity98 international striker , who is also chairman of @entity69
" at the same time , i would like to thank @entity82 for his invaluable contribution to @entity18 over the last three years , " " on behalf of the @entity106 , i wish him all the best for his future professional and personal life
