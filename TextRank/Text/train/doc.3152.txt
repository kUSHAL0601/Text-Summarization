the @entity54 has compiled a list of lightning safety tips on its website
there is no safe place outside during a thunderstorm or when lightning strikes , the agency said
to reduce the risk of injury or even death during severe weather , people planning outdoor activities of any kind should have a safety plan
at the first clap of thunder , the weather service said anybody outdoors should run for shelter or for their vehicles and they should remain sheltered for at least 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder is heard
when visiting the beach , where there is limited shelter available for taking cover during a thunderstorm , the weather service advises people to run for their cars at the first sign of thunder or lightning in the distance
the agency also warns against taking cover under the beach picnic shelters
it says water , wet items , like ropes and metal objects , including fences and poles , are big dangers during lightning storms because water and metal are both great conductors of electrical currents
the weather service also offers these tips for minimizing the risk of getting struck by lightning : avoid open fields and hilltops , stay away from tall , isolated trees or other tall objects , set up camps in lower lying areas and remember tents do not offer protection from lightning
there is also professional lightning detection equipment available that issues alerts when lightning is approaching an area
the weather service said it 's a good investment for outdoors sports groups or other outside events
