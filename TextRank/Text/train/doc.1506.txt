-- his gps monitor has been cut off and @entity3 is free -- but only legally
@entity3 fears for his life
he 's a reviled figure to millions , despite his acquittal saturday night in @entity8 's killing
and he could still be held criminally liable for @entity8 's death
@entity3 found not guilty ' they want revenge ' @entity3 's attorney describes him as a marked man
" he has to be very cautious and protective of his safety because there is still a fringe element who have said ... that they will not listen to a verdict of not guilty , " said @entity14
@entity3 , 29 , has kept his address under wraps for more than a year and worn a disguise whenever he left his four walls
he has often strapped on body armor , according to @entity14
and he may feel the need to be armed
when asked by @entity0 's @entity27 whether @entity3 will keep the gun used in the killing , his brother , @entity31 , said , " i do n't see any reason why he should n't
" i think he has more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him because they express they 're trying to kill him , all the time , every day , on my @entity40 feed , on the @entity41
" catch up on the trial , verdict @entity31 gave more details sunday on @entity0 's " @entity45
" " the threats are vile , they 're vicious , they 're disgusting
and sometimes they 're in person
people wearing shirts with my brother 's face on it in crosshairs , encouraging others to act out violently against him
i know that you ca n't take every one one of those seriously , but you ca n't afford to be wrong either
because you can be dead wrong if somebody really were intent on harming you
" " he 's going to have to learn to move about in a very low - profile way and keep to himself , " @entity31 said , although having the @entity61 removed and no trial to occupy his days helps end @entity3 's feeling of being " kind of caged in
" @entity3 , married with no children , may leave @entity65 and choose to lead a life in the shadows -- like @entity68 , the @entity65 woman acquitted of killing her 2 - year - old daughter in 2008
anger , sadness but little surprise @entity3 could face more criminal charges with the state criminal case over , @entity3 could now face new criminal charges
the federal government could file a civil rights suit , accusing him of violating 17 - year - old @entity8 's civil rights
the @entity79 has called on the @entity80 to file civil rights charges , and is asking the public to sign a petition
" the most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night @entity3 stalked and then took the life of @entity8 , " the group said
@entity3 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , acknowledged killing the unarmed teen , saying it was in self - defense
the @entity80 did not respond directly to the @entity79 demand
it has a separate federal investigation going on
an official told @entity0 the department " continues to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation , as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial
" meanwhile , the @entity8 family could file a civil lawsuit against @entity3 , seeking damages
the suit would claim wrongful death -- which is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter
and the rev. @entity107 said the acquittal was " only the first round in the pursuit of justice
" @entity79 president @entity112 expects legal action will proceed on both fronts
" there will be a civil phase almost assuredly , and then there will be a federal civil rights phase , " he told @entity0 's " @entity119 " on sunday
" and we are putting our faith in that system
" @entity31 rejected @entity124 ' call for charges against his brother
authorities have interviewed " about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances
and there is not any inkling of racism , " he said
" in fact , there 's evidence to show the opposite
i would encourage them to cool their jets , give everyone some time to kind of process what 's going on
" agitation does n't help us
it does n't do anybody any good right now
" sports stars sound off on verdict ' emotional and psychological hurdles ' those who defend @entity3 say he will struggle for the rest of his life over what happened , despite his contention that it was in self - defense
" in his religious beliefs , death by any definition is a tragedy , " @entity31 told @entity0 's @entity27
" so he has moral things that he 's going to have to deal with , and emotional and psychological hurdles he 's going to have to overcome
" those who believe he should be in jail for murder are quick to point out that @entity8 lost his life , and say there should be no tears shed for any struggles @entity3 may face
a young man 's post on @entity172 about @entity3 's future quickly went viral sunday
" for the rest of your life you are now going to feel what its like to be a black man in @entity181 , " @entity174 wrote
" you will feel people stare at you
judging you for what you think are unfair reasons
you will lose out on getting jobs for something you feel is outside of your control
you will believe yourself to be an upstanding citizen and wonder why people choose to not see that
... " i bet you never thought that by shooting a black male you 'd end up inheriting all of his struggles
" @entity174 added , " enjoy your ' freedom
' " @entity3 could still be held responsible for @entity8 's death support for @entity3 @entity3 's supporters have sent letters and e-mails to his lawyers , offering moral support and saying they sympathized with a man so concerned about neighborhood break - ins that he bought a gun and dog , and donned the mantle of neighborhood watchman
the letters often blame the media for his woes and offer encouragement for the road ahead
after the verdict , @entity14 too assailed news outlets for their coverage
" he was like a patient in an operating table where mad scientists were committing experiments on him and he had no anesthesia , " he said
many supporters sent in money to a website he established to help with his mounting legal bills
but one crisis public relations manager said @entity3 must tread lightly when accepting further public money
" he 's got to be careful about who he associates with afterward , even if they are offering financial support , " said @entity227
despite what may lie ahead , on saturday night , as his legal team surrounded him and congratulated each other with handshakes and hugs , @entity3 seemed to take a moment to soak in the relief -- aware that a long road lies ahead
