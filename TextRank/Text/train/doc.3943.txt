-- metro stations get a bad reputation as dark , grimy places where travelers are as likely to catch a communicable disease as they are a train
riding the subway need n't be a journey to the dark side
@entity10 , bright and colorful new metro stations have begun to open in several cities that make going cheek - to - cheek with 45 strangers in a metal tube almost feel worth it
with the latest of these , @entity21 's sunlit @entity20 , opening its doors this month , here 's a look at some of the world 's best
@entity20 ( @entity21 ) gloomier than most , @entity21 's underground rail network would make an ideal hangout for vampires , if only they could put up with the unpredictable weekend services and that weird smell at @entity30
creatures of the dark would do well to avoid the newly opened @entity20 though
this hub for nine subway lines in @entity35 sits under a huge oculus -- a beautiful conical conduit that pulls light down well below street level
@entity40 ( @entity41 ) inaugurated in 1998 to little fanfare , this otherwise ordinary looking station took on new life just three years later
in 2001 , @entity40 's platform was aesthetically enhanced by 11 enormous , domed lighting fixtures that continuously bathe the surroundings in haunting shades of blue , yellow and red
@entity50 ( @entity51 , @entity52 ) opened in 2012 , @entity50 station defies its depth -- at 50 meters , one of the deepest in @entity51 -- with a design based around themes of light and water
a work called " @entity61 , " by @entity62 , illuminates the station corridor furthest underground
this stunning station has competition : it 's part of the city 's network of so - called @entity70
@entity71 ( @entity72 ) @entity71 station 's baroque - style decor , historical mosaics and chandeliered ceilings resemble a grand ballroom
opened in 1952 to alleviate the congestion of one of @entity72 's busiest transport hubs , the opulence of the mosaics was inspired by an infamous wartime speech by @entity84
@entity85 ( @entity86 , @entity87 ) in 1998 , @entity86 hosted a world expo , in part to celebrate 500 years of @entity87 inventions
built to help transport the expo 's 11 million visitors , the station is a whimsically colorful space that to this day holds its own as a modern work of art. @entity98 ( @entity99 , @entity100 ) half metro station , half kaleidoscope , this church to commuting revolves around a dazzling " @entity105 " said to be the largest glass work in the world
the dome , consisting of 4,500 panels , is the work of @entity111 , an @entity52 designer who subtitled " @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114
" given the ecclesiastical appearance of this installation , it should come as no surprise that its been proposed as a venue for mass weddings
@entity121 ( @entity122 ) @entity123 might be the great great grandparent of all the world 's metro stations , but @entity121 , opened just days before the new millennium , has to be one of the most futuristic - looking
the austere concrete and stainless steel design somehow achieves a functional beauty rather than oppressing all those commuters scurrying to and from their offices
@entity133 ( @entity134 , @entity135 ) the driverless trains of @entity134 's shiny new ( ish ) metro system might be mildly disconcerting , but not as much as the bizarre , but beautiful jellyfish dangling from the ceiling of the the @entity141
these exotic chandeliers cast a luminous blue glow over the stop beneath the @entity146 shopping center and add to a watery theme further complimented by images of traditional pearl divers
@entity150 ( @entity151 ) above ground , @entity151 's central station looks like a pretty average part of a rapid transit system
start boring down , though , and unexpected changes in color and shape reveal a very different animal
when commuters reach the bold blue and white , cave - like platform at @entity150 , they 're reminded that they 've indeed ventured underground
various stations ( @entity164 , @entity165 ) there are many grim realities to life in @entity165 , but traveling on the @entity169 is unlikely to be high on the list , not least because of the ornate stations
these spotlessly clean deep level stops on the two - line network are styled as palaces for the people
it 's claimed the city 's underground rail network began life as a military facility and there are still lines and stations used exclusively by security services and government officials
@entity185 ( @entity186 , @entity187 ) seeking to distinguish his design from the unobtrusive minimalism of other @entity186 stations , architect @entity188 outdid himself with the fantastical entrance to @entity185
depicting a train car crashing through the sidewalk , it leaves commuters either shocked or bemused , but rarely indifferent
" @entity197 " ( @entity198 , @entity199 ) less than 20 years old , @entity198 's metro is the third - largest in @entity199
the curved - glass entrances of many of the stations -- affectionately nicknamed " @entity197 " ( " @entity205 " ) after their creator , @entity201 -- are considered prime examples of the city 's modern , up - to - the - minute style
the transparent structures admit plenty of daytime light and at night are lit up
@entity213 -- @entity214 ( @entity215 ) in a city as beautiful as @entity215 , this unconventional station entrance at @entity217 still stands out
completed in 2000 ( the centennial year of the @entity215 metro ) , @entity221 's " @entity220 " ( " @entity222 " ) intertwines dazzling colored beads to form two protective cupolas
a meeker design would be overshadowed by the close proximity of the @entity214 and surrounding classic architecture
in this case , however , it adds a touch of cheeky hipness
@entity232 ( @entity233 , @entity234 ) @entity233 's newest metro stop proves that classic and modern design can coexist harmoniously
after many setbacks , the station finally opened for business in december 2011
stark curved ceilings and low lighting complement traditional marble and arched platforms in what 's the deepest station in the network
@entity247 ( @entity248 , @entity249 ) the @entity250 built some extraordinary metro stations , but this 2005 effort , named after @entity254 president @entity253 , showed that a capitalist @entity249 could come up with some beauties , too
unless , as might appear , it was actually built by @entity257
@entity258 ( @entity259 ) all the stations on @entity259 's @entity261 deserve a place in the @entity264 metro hall of fame for their distinctive dimpled metal tunnel walls , but @entity258 is the most visited and photographed
a different color for each station , they look like something from the dystopian film " @entity270 , " but the bubble - wrap design actually strengthens the metal
@entity273 ( @entity274 , @entity275 ) @entity274 's clean and efficient metro network has been built with style in mind , so there 's plenty to look at across its 108 stations
leading the charge is the @entity273 stop where gigantic murals by artist @entity284 cover the walls
the epic scale of these acrylic and oil on canvas works match their subject matter -- the highs and lows of @entity275 history
puts the daily commute in perspective
