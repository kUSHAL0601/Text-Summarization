-- the mystery barge in @entity3 is indeed a @entity5 project , and houses a fancy , floating showroom for @entity7 and other products , a @entity0 affiliate is reporting
according to @entity10 in @entity3 , the barge structure will become one of a small fleet of luxury event spaces , complete with a party deck for invitation - only visitors
the station cited " multiple sources " including at least one who has been aboard the barge , and said it was dreamed up at @entity17 , the company 's secret facility where engineers have cooked up projects like @entity7 and a self - driving car
the facility is constructed from interchangeable shipping containers and is designed to be disassembled and transported via barge or train to other locations , a source said
at least two other similar barges , including one in the @entity34 , @entity35 , harbor , also have been spotted since the " mystery barge " -- docked at a pier on @entity38 , just east of @entity3 -- first made headlines earlier this week
all of them are marked by the letters " @entity43 " and four numbers
an unnamed tenant that moved into a hangar on @entity38 on august 1 goes by the handle , " by and large " -- possibly a playful reference to the corporation in the @entity51 movie " @entity47 " the fancy barges will be an effort by @entity5 to upstage rival @entity56 's stylized retail stores , a source said
in a statement , the @entity58 confirmed it is working with the barges ' owners to make sure the floating structures have the proper permits and permissions to operate in the bay
but it did n't say much else
" regardless of the company or entity involved , the @entity58 has an obligation to protect sensitive proprietary information , as a company 's competitive posture and business interests depend on it , " said the branch of the @entity68 military in the brief statement
@entity7 , worn like regular glasses , has a high - resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access features like e-mail , text messaging , @entity86 , @entity5 search and a handful of other apps
it is currently being tested by about 10,000 " explorers , " who paid $ 1,500 for the glasses
that program is being expanded
this week , @entity5 announced current testers may invite up to three friends , as well as a planned rollout of a new version of @entity7
if the reports about the barges are true , it may take some time before the project is officially confirmed
@entity5 has declined to comment on the reports
and a shroud of secrecy has cloaked the entire proceedings
a sign outside the @entity107 and large hangar on @entity38 has a sign saying that all visitors must hand over their cellphones , cameras , and other recording devices
@entity3 mayor @entity113 is also among those in the dark
" they 've kept a secret from me as well , " he told @entity10 .
