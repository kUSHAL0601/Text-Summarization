@entity0 , @entity1 -- state and federal authorities in @entity1 traded barbs over the escape of 141 inmates from a border city prison as police stepped up security and searched for convicts on the run
the inmates -- apparently in collusion with prison workers -- escaped through a service entrance for staff vehicles , according to information from a preliminary state investigation presented to reporters friday
the prison director also " disappeared , " said @entity22 , public safety secretary for @entity25 state
after state authorities divulged the massive escape at the @entity30 , @entity1 's interior ministry slammed local officials in @entity32 , @entity1
" it is deplorable , the absence of effective measures of control and guarding on the part of local authorities , which has allowed frequent escapes from prisons , putting community security at risk , " the ministry said in a statement
@entity45 fired back , arguing that state officials had repeatedly asked the federal government for help guarding prisons , which often house federal prisoners serving time for their connection with drug gangs
" the state does not have the capacity to stop their escape , which is why we have insisted on the support of the federal government to guarantee that they would be well guarded and thus avoid massive escapes , " a statement from @entity22 's office said
earlier this year there were at least two other high - profile prison escapes in @entity25 , which borders @entity66
in september , 85 inmates used a ladder to clear a wall and escape from a prison in the border city of @entity73 , state media reported
in march , 40 inmates escaped from another prison in the border city of @entity77
on friday , @entity45 told reporters that the escape was reported after guards took roll call around 7 p.m. thursday
" we will have no restriction on punishing whoever has to be punished , " @entity45 said , according to the state - run @entity83 news agency
" we are going to act with the full weight of the law
" at least 58 of the prisoners who escaped friday were federal inmates , he said
about 1,700 federal inmates are in prisons statewide , @entity45 said
security at eight other penitentiaries has been tightened , he told @entity96
@entity25 has been a battleground in a bloody turf war between the @entity100 gang and the @entity102 cartel , but authorities did not indicate friday whether drug gangs were involved in the escape
@entity2 's @entity106 contributed to this report .
