-- for years as he chased his dream , shooting hoops and racing up and down the court , professional basketball player @entity1 wore the no. 98 jersey
it was a personal gesture , a way of remembering @entity8 , a gay college student whose own dreams were ended in 1998 , when he died after being tied to a fence post , beaten and tortured
but when @entity1 came out as the first openly gay @entity13 player in history , that number suddenly took on a broader significance
" i 've grown so much as an individual , i 've come across so many great people , great organizations , heard so many great stories , inspiring stories , " @entity1 said , adding " ... it 's nice to have a positive impact on someone 's else 's life , and i feel like with my actions that i 've had a positive impact on someone 's else 's life
" this week , that jersey became the top - selling one in the @entity13
the @entity13 announced friday that it will donate all proceeds from the sale of @entity1 jerseys to the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) and the @entity36
in addition , the league will auction off @entity1 ' autographed , game - worn jerseys to benefit the same organizations
" it 's really cool to see the support that 's out there , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity42 in an interview set to air friday evening
" and yeah , it 's cool to see that people are going out there and buying the jersey and , you know , wearing it with pride
so i hope that continues , and you know i 'll keep wearing the jersey and keep going out there and trying to , you know , do my job
" @entity1 became a symbol for the gay rights movement after disclosing that he is gay in an april @entity64 magazine column
since then , he 's received a warm outpouring of support from basketball colleagues , league officials and fans
" i know everyone in the @entity13 family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment , " @entity13 commissioner @entity70 said after @entity1 ' signing last sunday
@entity1 ' path from a little - known , aging @entity13 center to gay rights icon who was invited by first lady @entity81 to the @entity82 is one that speaks to the nation 's changing attitudes about homosexuality
last week , he signed a 10 - day contract with the @entity87
according to a national @entity90 poll conducted in september , 56 % of the nation supports marriage for same - sex couples , compared with only 25 % who supported it in 1996
a @entity0 poll in 2010 was the first time a poll found that a majority of respondents backed it
we are becoming a very different nation from the one in which @entity8 's murder became a watershed moment and rallying cry for the gay community
becoming , but not quite there yet
" i 've met some other athletes who sort of are in the same position as i am , and we 're sort of like a fraternity just trying to help each other , just trying to , uh , keep inspiring each other , whether it be @entity118 or @entity109 , the list goes on and on , " @entity1 told @entity108 , an openly gay soccer player , and @entity109 , an openly gay @entity111 prospect
" so many great athletes i 've met along my journey
and it 's really great to , you know , hear each other 's stories and keep , you know , inspiring each other ( out here )
" when she visited @entity1 in @entity130 , @entity8 's mother , @entity132 , gave the basketball player some words of encouragement
" ... her message was like , ' let the haters hate
' just keep ... living your life and keep going out there and being yourself , " @entity1 said .
