-- " @entity4 " officially begins filming today , according to a letter posted yesterday by writer - director @entity2 at @entity3
" tomorrow we start shooting , " writes the geek auteur , before adding , " i think i 'm legally permitted to say that
" @entity8 does n't offer any hints about the plot of the movie , although he does say that they 'll be shooting " the pivotal death / betrayal / product placement / setting up the sequel / coming out scene , " which is probably a joke , but a boy can dream , ca n't he ? ( elsewhere in the letter , @entity2 says that he 's pretty sure the movie is about the @entity20
) " @entity4 , " currently slated for a may 4 release next year , will unite the lead characters from @entity23 's " @entity22 , " " @entity24 , " " @entity25 , " and " @entity26 " into one mega-adventure
( and remember : if everything goes according to plan , " @entity4 " will also inspire a few franchises of its own
