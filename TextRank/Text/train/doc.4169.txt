-- @entity1 once suggested women footballers should wear tighter shorts -- now his organization , @entity4 , has been accused of blatant sexism in its selection of the person to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity10
the investigation and subsequent report by @entity14 lawyer @entity13 , head of @entity4 's investigative chamber of the ethics committee , has become emblematic of the world governing body 's reluctance to embrace a greater degree of transparency following criticism of the way @entity4 is run
@entity4 president @entity1 does n't want the report published because he fears it will contravene @entity4 's privacy laws , though @entity13 and others such as the head of @entity32 soccer @entity30 president @entity29 have indicated they 'd like it to be made public
now three former members of the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , the body tasked with working on reform proposals and drawing up a shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation into the bids for the @entity43 , which were awarded to @entity44 and @entity45 , have told @entity0 that @entity4 officials insisted that a woman should not be nominated for the role @entity13 eventually assumed
according to two of those former @entity37 members , @entity13 , who recently delivered his long - awaited report , was not even on the original shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation
@entity55 , who left the @entity37 in april last year after becoming frustrated with the lack of progress being made , recalls the occasion in 2012 where she was left stunned by suggestions that the committee should not consider any female candidates for the lead investigator role
sitting in the dining hall with two @entity37 colleagues during @entity4 's @entity66 in @entity67 that year , she claims she was approached by two senior @entity4 employees
" i turned from the group to face them and one of the men told me , ' stop putting women forward for these positions
' he told me they would not be acceptable and that i was fighting the wrong battle , " @entity55 said
" i did n't really take in what he was saying and then it hit me
" i said , ' did you really just say that ? ' i was startled
they started to elaborate on their views and gave me more and more details
" i was the only woman at the table and they were directing their views just at me
" @entity89 , a fellow member of the @entity37 was also present alongside @entity90 when a discussion was had over the possibility of female nominations
he said the @entity4 officials did not approach her and tell her to stop putting forth women , but confirmed to @entity0 that the two men said that it would be very unlikely that @entity98 would appoint a woman because @entity4 is still very unbalanced in gender terms
when @entity0 then approached @entity101 -- who chaired the @entity37 until its final report in april 2014 to discuss the allegation -- he said : " it is true that @entity4 was not keen to elect women into these positions
" when @entity0 contacted @entity4 with the allegation , a spokesperson reiterated the organization 's support of women
" at the time the president has explained that the candidate would have the full support of the football world , " the spokesperson said
" it is about acceptance
unfortunately , a female may find it difficult to lead an investigation in certain parts of the world
" that 's unfortunate but you have to look at what will be acceptable to the majority of people within football throughout the world
" the investigator would be working at all levels of football in dealing with ethics
" the president hopes that there will be more women in leading positions in football
" there are already three women on the @entity98 ( @entity141 ) and that shows @entity4 's commitment to women and their importance
" last month , @entity1 spoke of @entity4 's " exemplary organization in ethics " while addressing the @entity148 in @entity149
but @entity4 is facing more questions , with the process through which @entity13 was appointed as the lead investigator under scrutiny
how the former @entity14 attorney for the @entity155 came to write the report is something of a conundrum , given he was not included on the original shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation
a @entity4 spokesperson confirmed to @entity0 that when a shortlist of eight names -- which were compiled in order of ranking -- was submitted to football 's world governing body in may 2012 , @entity13 's name was absent
the names , which were submitted for the investigative and adjudicatory positions by the @entity37 before @entity90 was approached in @entity67 , included four men and four women -- all of whom worked in either the judicial or investigative sector
the choice of @entity13 was met with surprise by those at the @entity37 given the nature of their recommendations , with chairman @entity101 suggesting that the @entity185 prosecutor was not his first choice
the credentials of @entity13 , who worked in the last @entity190 administration , are impressive , but @entity101 's preference to lead the investigation was @entity194 prosecutor @entity193 , whose nomination was vetoed by the country 's president @entity196
the second - choice candidate was unable to take up the role because of illness and has since passed away , according to @entity101
according to a @entity4 spokesperson , the @entity37 was not the only body to offer potential nominations for the role of lead investigator
@entity101 says the nomination of @entity13 came through the secretary general of @entity209 @entity208
@entity13 , who once worked as vice-president of the @entity211 on @entity209 's executive committee , currently works in @entity185 as a partner at @entity214
@entity4 and @entity209 , the world 's largest police organization , enjoy a partnership which stretches back to 2011
the 10 - year agreement , which is worth â‚¬ 20 million ( $ 25 million ) and was set up to combat match fixing , has helped to create a dedicated sports integrity unit in @entity220 which opened on tuesday
an @entity209 spokesman confirmed that while the two bodies do enjoy a close relationship , @entity209 did not make the appointment of @entity13 -- though he commented that " @entity4 could find no better man or woman to discharge the duties assigned to mr. @entity13
" when asked whether @entity209 had received any specific instructions over the gender of candidates , the spokesman replied : " when it comes to promoting gender equality , @entity209 has led by example
" the world police body 's president is a woman
its cabinet director and head of its global awareness initiative , @entity241 , is a woman
the head of @entity209 's @entity244 and @entity245 unit is a woman
and one of its key @entity249 managers is a woman
" the controversy over @entity13 's appointment comes in the wake of his statement , published last week , which called on @entity4 to publish his report in full
such a move is unlikely
@entity255 , who presides over the adjudicatory arm of @entity4 's ethics committee , told reporters earlier this month that only his findings would be published and not @entity13 's report
that move was met with condemnation by some @entity264 members
@entity265 , the president of @entity266 , has urged for the report to be published , as have @entity4 vice-presidents @entity269 from @entity270 and @entity271 of @entity272
" given the limited role mr. @entity255 envisions for the @entity275 , i believe it is now necessary for the @entity264 to authorize the appropriate publication of the report on the @entity279 into the 2018/2022 @entity280 , " read @entity13 's statement
" publication would be consistent with statements made by a number of @entity141 members , with the view recently expressed by @entity37 chair @entity101 , and with the goals of the reform process
" his call appears to have fallen on deaf ears , with @entity1 insisting he has not had any contact with @entity13
" the only contact we have had with the president of the ( ethics committee ) investigatory chamber has been his press releases that we have received in @entity4 , " @entity1 told reporters
" but we have not received any demands or requests from mr. @entity13 to speak to us , or to ask that we should make a decision on this report and to publish this report , and to change the confidentiality which is in the code of ethics of @entity4
" @entity1 's stance has been supported by @entity4 's legal director @entity307 , who said that witness confidentiality could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published
" the code of ethics is based on certain principles , one of which is confidentiality , " @entity307 told reporters
" cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality , if not perhaps certain witnesses , whistleblowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent , " he said , adding that 75 witnesses had been heard during @entity13 's investigation
@entity0 contacted @entity13 's office in @entity185 to ask whether it could answer questions relating to his omission from the original list , his recommendation by @entity209 and the gender - specific allegations
a spokesman for @entity13 said all inquiries should be made to @entity4 .
