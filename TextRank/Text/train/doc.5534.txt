@entity0 -- a few days ago , i received an @entity4 message from a young girl who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
she was struggling in school and depressed since being diagnosed
she shared her situation knowing i had found a way to live peacefully with my attention deficit disorder , which gave her hope she could do the same
i was so deeply touched because her story is mine
as early as the second grade , i knew something was different about me
i could n't sit still in class
it was torture for me
my teachers constantly requested i stop fidgeting , but i could n't
i was confused because other kids did n't seem to have my problem
additionally , it was impossible to focus on my teacher and her lessons
my mind would float off with the clouds , way more interested in imagination than the reality of a boring textbook
@entity29 always paled in comparison to the vibrant world i created in my mind
the classroom was my jail
the highlight of my day was recess , where i was a natural born leader
on the playground , i was somebody for one glorious hour a day
then it was back to the classroom and my feelings of inadequacies
my inability to sit still and focus eventually took its toll on my academic performance
if students could n't or did n't keep up , they were labeled " learning disabled " and placed in a " special " class with other kids who shared the same shame
regardless of your specific learning challenges , all students were thrown into one big class
it changed my mindset about my capabilities and who i thought i was
i labeled myself " stupid " and set out to prove my theory right
i lost all self - esteem and self - respect
in fifth grade , i gave up on myself
i stopped learning and started surviving
as my academic workload intensified , so did my self - loathing
i feared my deep , dark secret would be discovered at any moment
to prevent that from happening , i became the class clown
i developed skills to mask my inadequacies
for example , if i was asked a question and did n't know the answer , i would simply crack a joke
although i seemed happy , my despair over my academic performance weighed heavily on my heart
my parents tried their best to support me and lift my spirits , but their efforts fell on deaf ears
i felt alone , hurt and by high school , suicidal
sports provide a turning point luckily , sports were an arena where i excelled and felt good about myself
i was a natural athlete , and my sport of choice was softball
my parents took notice of my ability early
they practiced with me daily , came to my games and even coached my @entity90 softball team
often they taught me life lessons using sports analogies
they learned to speak " my language , " and it made sense
my tenacity , competitiveness and desire to win developed on the softball field
by the time i reached high school , i was a softball super star ! i still was n't a fan of schoolwork , but to play softball , i had to maintain a minimum 2.0 gpa
so , i did the bare minimum to be eligible for the team
during these years , my inability to control my emotions became a major part of my struggle
my temper tantrums were legendary
i started hanging out with some high school dropouts and experimenting with drugs because i wanted to fit in
still struggling with the undiagnosed adhd , i was a full - blown teenage jerk
luckily my parents were on top of it and implemented a strict and relentless set of rules
i would scream obscenities at the top of my lungs
i tried the silent treatment
my parent 's rules were set in stone like the @entity134 : no drugs , no loser friends and no dropping out of high school
i resigned myself to my fate
all i could see was the finish line my senior year
although my academic struggles still made me feel worthless , i stayed involved in school because as captain of the softball team , i was determined to see our team get to the state finals
we did make it , but were eliminated in the first round
nonetheless , i was honored as an all - state softball all - star -- a rare proud moment during my bleak high school years
high school musical to the rescue when softball season ended , i felt hopeless
i had no prospects for my future
college was n't an option because i could not imagine four more years of torture
on a whim and to procrastinate doing homework , i signed up to work as a props master for our annual high school musical
as i watched the performances from backstage , a small flame was ignited in me
a few days later , i sheepishly asked my parents what they thought of me becoming an actor
clearly concerned , they paused for a moment , then my father said , " you 'd be great at acting
" my mom then chimed in sarcastically , " you can put all those emotions to work " as she winked at me
that 's all i needed to hear
acting became my new softball , my new passion
suddenly the kid who hated school was going to college
in college , many of my @entity188 characteristics that had created so much grief in the past became assets
with my vivid imagination , i could believe wholeheartedly in the imaginary worlds portrayed in plays
i 'm also very emotional and impulsive
while these may not be such great qualities in a corporate office , they helped me excel in the world of theater
by my sophomore year , i was on a full academic scholarship
after i graduated from @entity204 in @entity205 , i moved to @entity206 to pursue my dream of becoming a professional actor
finally , my questions had answers fast forward to 2009
i 'm one of the stars of @entity213 's hit tv series " @entity214
" my early struggles in school were a distant memory
life was great , except for one little thing -- my daughter @entity221 was a real chip off the old block
she was fidgety and had a tough time sitting still in school
her second - grade teacher suggested @entity221 get tested for @entity188
the results confirmed she had it
on a whim , i decided to follow suit and get tested
finally my entire childhood made sense ! i was n't happy about having the disorder , but at least now i knew i was n't alone
i had a child to shepherd through the @entity232 landscape
i wanted her to thrive , not just survive like i did
i had to learn more
i googled @entity188 , and the first link to pop up was @entity240
everything i needed to know was there , including critical information about how to be a powerful advocate for your child in school
it was a light at the end of a tunnel
the website gave me the information and tools i needed to best support my daughter and myself
i contacted @entity254 and spoke with several members of their leadership team
i was so impressed with their resources , their commitment and dedication to this condition that i offered my services to support them
in late 2013 , @entity254 asked me to be their national spokesperson
i proudly accepted this important role to help people feel comfortable living with @entity188 and let them know they deserve the opportunity to live up to their full potential
early diagnosis and treatment greatly increase their chances of doing that
i want to share one more message with the young girl who sent me that @entity4 message and with others who are struggling with @entity280
( and lean forward because this is important )
you 're not stupid , broken or disordered
celebrate the good , step over the bad and work around the ugly
realize that those of us with @entity188 / @entity232 have a skill that allows us to see the world through a unique lens
we are different , not defective
you can see @entity290 on the " @entity214 " two - hour special sunday , march 16 , on @entity213 and follow her on @entity292 and @entity4 @ wendydoffical .
