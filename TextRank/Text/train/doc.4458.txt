" it was n't as spectacular as our win over @entity56 a fortnight ago but i am very happy with the win
" both teams converted three penalties in a tense first half , as @entity1 's @entity61 and his @entity35 counterpart @entity62 both registered a trio of successful kicks
the crucial moment in the match arrived early in the second half after @entity62 's attempted clearance was charged down , resulting in a five - meter scrum
winger @entity71 attempted to advance beyond the @entity35 try - line before the ball was fed to @entity19 , who touched down to put @entity1 14 - 9 ahead
" i think the @entity74 are better than us at the moment
we 're very fragile , " @entity33 told @entity76
