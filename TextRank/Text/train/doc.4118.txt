-- here 's what we do know about next week : @entity4 and @entity5 will kick off the annual meeting of the @entity7 in @entity8 on september 21
here 's what we do n't know : will they be grandparents yet ? why are we asking right now ? @entity11 first learned that @entity12 was pregnant while she shared the stage with her mother during a women 's event in @entity8 back in april
the former first family has not disclosed the due date
but if you assume she waited the standard three months to share her news ... three plus april , may , june , july , august ... that makes september the ninth month
plus , when she was speaking at another women 's event in @entity25 on friday , @entity5 tried to excite @entity26 about voting in november with this pitch : " now i 've been thinking a lot about family because you know i 'm on ' grandbaby watch ' and i think a lot about this new member of our family and what he or she can look forward to , " she said
" and i am well aware that we will do everything possible to prepare this child , to protect this child
but i want that for everybody 's child and everybody 's grandchild
i want every one of our children to feel that they are inheriting the best of @entity11 , that they have the chance to do what i believed was possible for me and what my husband believed was possible for him and what we instilled in our daughter that really this country is on your side
" this country will give you the fighting chance , the fair show you deserves to have
this country will give you the level playing field
so whether you 're the grandchild of a president , or the grandchild of a janitor , whether you 're born in a city or in a small rural village -- no matter who you are , you have the right to inherit the @entity11 dream
" on september 8 , @entity71 was on stage and interrupted an appearance he was making with former president @entity74 to answer a phone that was in his pocket
his eyes got big when he looked at the caller id and he said , " only two people in the world have this number and they 're both related to me
i hope i 'm not being told i 'm about to be made a premature grandfather
" but that was n't the call
he and @entity74 went on to discuss grandfatherhood
" get ready also to be , like , the lowest person in the pecking order in your family , " @entity74 told @entity71
@entity93 also recently alluded to the advanced stage of her pregnancy during an interview with the online magazine @entity97 -- she was plugging a new line of clothes meant to raise awareness about endangered elephants -- where she talked about her own current clothing choices
" you 're asking someone who is very pregnant
in the here and now , [ i wear ] anything that fits over my belly
increasingly , that 's my husband 's t - shirts or button - down shirts , " she said
" so , the honest answer in the here and now is a different answer than it would be had you asked me a few months ago , or ask me again in nine months
but , for right now , it 's really my husband 's shirts , because they 're the only things that fit me
" so we know @entity12 is squarely in the hot zone
but we do n't know much else
including : is it a boy or a girl ? we do n't know
where will the @entity71 baby be delivered ? we do n't know
but here are some potential clues : when @entity5 was treated for a blood clot in 2013 , she went to @entity133 on the @entity134 of @entity135
when former president @entity71 underwent heart surgery ten years ago , he went to @entity138 , too
how will the nursery be decorated ? we do n't know , but in that recent interview on the fashion blog , @entity93 suggested there could be an elephant theme
what will the baby be named ? we do n't know
but here are some suggestions : first , if it 's a boy , maybe consider pulling a name from one of the 44 presidents
@entity154 could be an obvious choice
it was in the top five of new baby names , according to the @entity160 's annual survey
but what about @entity162 or @entity163 ? those are strong names for @entity26
probably not @entity166 , after that 2008 primary
if it 's a girl , the name @entity168 is off the table , since that 's what @entity171 named her daughter back in 2013
there are n't any former presidents after which to name her
