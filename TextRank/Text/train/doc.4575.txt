the 2016 presidential race is just beginning
yet we already can say this much : despite a bump in the polls , and the fact that some conservatives consider him the prototype for successful leaders , @entity4 gov. @entity3 would be a terrible choice for the @entity13 nomination
of course , @entity13 have made bad choices before
a recent @entity16 survey found @entity3 to be the first pick of 15 % of the @entity13 faithful likely to attend the @entity19
so why would @entity3 be a bad choice ? three reasons
the world is a dangerous place
we ca n't afford another commander - in - chief with no foreign policy experience who does n't understand @entity29 's role in the world
as the governor of @entity4 -- as opposed to @entity29 senator ( @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35 ) or a former @entity37 ambassador ( @entity36 ) -- @entity3 's diplomatic experience is limited to settling disputes with @entity40 during football season
he would be learning on the job while rogue actors like @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 threaten @entity29 , create unrest and perpetuate acts of terror
there are times to look to the states and elect leaders who can focus the nation 's attention on domestic priorities like the economy , and there are times to look for leaders with a firm handle on foreign policy because the stakes are too high to gamble on that front
guess which era we 're living in
built - in enemies are extra baggage
@entity3 has repeatedly fought organized labor in @entity4 -- over collective bargaining , an attempted recall , running for re-election -- and scored impressive victories
but @entity3 has also antagonized that special interest , which will spend tens of millions of dollars in the presidential election to settle the score
unions might otherwise feel ambivalent about a @entity81 candidacy , especially with the prospect of an insurgent campaign by sen. @entity84 of @entity85 , who would likely embrace more firmly the divisive rhetoric about income equality that union members love to hear
if @entity3 is the @entity13 nominee , ambivalence will be trumped by anger
an activated and animated base of union supporters throwing money at the @entity94 is a headache that @entity13 do n't need
@entity3 is not eager to grab hold of thorny issues
on immigration , he likes sound bites , declaring his opposition to " amnesty " and his support for " securing the border
" he uses platitudes about how ours is " a country both of immigrants and of laws
" during a recent appearance on @entity114 's " @entity113 , " host @entity110 asked @entity3 what he would do about the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants
the governor responded that , while he did n't support the immigration bills in @entity119 , he did think the debate needs a " healthy balance " and he was not " advocating " the deportation of all illegal immigrants
finally , he said , " we need to enforce the laws in the @entity29 , and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country , and that does not mean amnesty
" clear as mud , eh ? @entity3 also has difficulty on common - sense issues that should not be all that thorny , like evolution
on a trip to @entity138 this week , presumably intended to beef up his " foreign policy credentials , " the governor bobbled a question on the topic and had to issue a follow - up statement
the only benefit that @entity13 could reap from nominating @entity3 is that , while he is probably not ready to lead the country , he could settle an argument within the party that the @entity13 must resolve and put behind it if @entity13 are ever going to win another presidential election
most of the conservatives i know who think @entity3 should be the @entity13 nominee are convinced that @entity13 keep making the same mistake of nominating moderates
the secret to beating @entity94 , they say , is to draw contrasts and stay true to conservative principles
@entity13 are confused : do they nominate a moderate with wider appeal or a " true conservative " loyal to the party 's principles ? the way that those on the far right see it , they 've failed twice with a moderate nominee ( sen. @entity167 of @entity168 in 2008 , former @entity85 gov. @entity163 in 2012 )
if the party nominates another moderate in 2016 ( former @entity171 gov. @entity170 , @entity173 gov. @entity172 , former @entity175 gov. @entity174 , etc. ) , and loses again , that faction will continue to delude itself into thinking that the @entity13 must nominate a rigid conservative to win
there is only one cure for this delusion : @entity13 need to scratch that itch and nominate a person they believe to be a strong conservative
and when they nominate him , and lose anyway , they can put this argument to rest
republicans will have run out of excuses
only then , can they achieve the epiphany that could save them from going the way of the @entity191 : voters are n't just rejecting the @entity13 's messenger but its message
to many @entity29 , @entity13 are mean - spirited , intolerant , xenophobic and reactionary obstructionists who care only about the rich , preserving the status quo and protecting the majority , and who are better at explaining what they 're against than spelling out what they 're for
much of what we hear from @entity13 candidates -- especially those trying to woo conservative voters -- reinforces that perception
if the @entity13 crafts a better message , it wo n't have to worry so much about choosing the right messenger
but first , the party has an argument to settle
so , at the moment , there is only one message that matters : @entity217 , @entity218 .
