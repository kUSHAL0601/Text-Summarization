@entity0 and its fledgling security forces , overwhelmed by militia violence and unrest since the overthrow of dictator @entity5 two years ago , are going to get some help from the @entity8 military , a top @entity8 commander said
adm. @entity10 , head of the @entity8 @entity11 , said saturday the @entity8 will train 5,000 to 7,000 conventional troops as well as counterterrorism forces
another @entity8 official told @entity15 the training is likely to take place in @entity18 once all the details are finalized
a major challenge will be developing a security force that 's not influenced by the well - armed militias that have proliferated in the lawless atmosphere across @entity0
mourning in @entity24 a day after dozens are killed " as we go forward to try and find a good way to build up the @entity0 security forces so they are not run by militias , we are going to have to assume some risks , " @entity10 said
" as a country , we have to say there is probably some risk that some of the people we will be training with do not have the most clean record
at the end of the day , it is the best solution we can find to train them to deal with their own problems
" he made the remarks at a defense forum at the @entity45 in @entity46 just a day after deadly fighting in the capital , @entity24 , on friday
state news said at least 43 people were killed and hundreds of others were wounded during clashes
popular sentiment against the various militias has been mounting for months in @entity24 and other parts of the country , including the eastern city of @entity58 , which has been gripped by increasing violence , including political assassinations
the chaos in @entity0 hit home for @entity8 after @entity8 ambassador @entity63 and three other @entity8 were killed on september 11 , 2012 , in an attack on the @entity8 diplomatic mission in @entity58
the @entity8 has offered a reward of up to $ 10 million for information leading to the arrest of anyone involved in the attack
while @entity8 authorities have filed charges in the case , no one has been arrested
a @entity76 air campaign helped overthrow @entity5 two years ago , but ever since there has been widespread unrest and poor security
" the @entity8 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , and the @entity84 have done little to follow through with an effective @entity0 restructural policy
they have struggled to coordinate support to address the problems with @entity0 's security sector and justice system , " a @entity87 report said in september
