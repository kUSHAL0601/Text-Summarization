-- the news editor of the @entity3 newspaper @entity2 has gone on trial for allegedly circulating obscene material to politicians , the newspaper states on its web site
@entity3 president @entity10 has branded the childbirth photos pornographic
in early june , @entity12 wrote to the country 's vice president , health minister and several non-governmental organizations to highlight problems in the country 's health - care system -- especially the problems pregnant women faced during a strike by health - care workers
in her letter , @entity12 included several photos of a woman giving birth in a parking lot outside a hospital from which she had been turned away , according to @entity30
the country 's president , @entity10 , branded the photos pornographic and called for @entity12 's arrest and prosecution , according to the press freedom organization
" @entity12 's arrest is shocking and the grounds are ridiculous , " the organization said in a statement on its web site after the arrest
now the trial into the alleged obscene photos has begun in the @entity48 magistrate 's court , the newspaper web site says
one of the first witnesses , @entity50 , a senior private secretary to the vice president , told the court he was immediately disturbed by the pictures he found inside the letter , according to the paper
the @entity2 described the courtroom as " packed to capacity " and said " people from all works of life including musicians and opposition political party members " had come to support @entity12
defense lawyer @entity64 has asked the court to look into whether the president 's order to arrest and prosecute @entity12 could influence the course of justice
a joint statement from several @entity3 media organizations , published on @entity2 's web site , calls for the government to amend the law on obscenity to clarify what constitutes obscenity and material that can corrupt morals
the statement concedes that the pictures were in bad taste , but notes that they were sent on behalf of a good cause : to end the strike
@entity0 efforts to obtain comment from both @entity2 and the @entity3 government have been unsuccessful
