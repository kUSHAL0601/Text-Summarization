-- traveling the world playing professional tennis is n't as lucrative as it appears
if you 're outside the top 100 , the consensus is that making a profit is difficult
@entity8 's @entity7 , currently ranked 30th , told @entity0 last year that he needed to pocket $ 200,000 a season just to break even
the players , then , will be happy to hear about another prize money boost at the @entity11
it seems that every grand slam nowadays increases the total on offer and the @entity11 did n't buck the trend after announcing it will pay out a tournament record $ 3 million to singles winners in september at @entity19
ten years ago , @entity20 took home $ 1 million for beating @entity21 in the men 's final
based on current conversion rates , the $ 3 million is slightly less than the Â £ 1.76 million ( $ 3.01 million ) dished out to the singles champions at @entity26 last weekend
@entity26 and the @entity11 lead the way in prize money of the four majors
the @entity11 is also handing out double - digit raises in each round of the singles , something lower - ranked players will be particularly pleased about
overall , prize money climbs to a tournament record $ 38.3 million
" last year , to recognize the importance of the players and the key role they have in building our sport , the @entity38 shared our vision to reach $ 50 million in prize money at the @entity11 by 2017 , " @entity37 , the @entity38 's chairman of the board and president , said in a statement wednesday
" this year 's prize money increase continues the commitment to make the @entity11 one of the most lucrative purses in all of sports
" @entity54 and @entity55 are the defending champions at the @entity11 , which begins august 25 .
