-- the specter of @entity3 military intervention in @entity4 prompted dire warnings from @entity7 's supreme leader , new president , and top diplomat , according to @entity7 's @entity10
talk of @entity3 military action against @entity4 's @entity14 regime emerged after what rebels say was a deadly chemical attack by the regime that killed civilians last week
since then , a flurry of comments and activity seems to be laying the groundwork for a military strike against the regime
at the same time , @entity26 inspectors are looking for evidence that chemical weapons were used in the @entity30 suburbs
the mounting tension has brought warnings from leaders in @entity7 , a longtime supporter of the @entity14 regime
" starting this fire will be like a spark in a large store of gunpowder , with unclear and unspecified outcomes and consequences , " @entity37 ayatollah @entity36 told @entity40 @entity39 members in @entity41 on wednesday
@entity4 strikes could worsen war , analysts say " the @entity3 threats and possible intervention in @entity4 is a disaster for the region and if such an act is done , certainly , the @entity3 will sustain damage like when they interfered in @entity57 and @entity58
" president @entity59 , also speaking to the @entity39 , said people in the @entity61 and the world wo n't accept " a new war " and deplored threats to use force
" any adventurism in the region will pose irreparable dangers to the stability of the region and the world and will merely lead to the spread of extremism and terrorism in the region , " @entity59 said
' red line ' debate : chemical weapons worse than attacks ? he called on the @entity26 inspectors to carry out unbiased investigations to identify the culprits behind the chemical weapons use in @entity4 , and said , " each and every measure should be taken with respect to the sensitive situation of the region , rapid ending of the internal crisis , and prevention of extremism in the region and in the framework of the international rules and regulations
" foreign minister @entity97 likened a possible attack to a return to " the @entity100
" @entity97 condemned any possible military intervention in @entity4 on wednesday , warning of " graver conditions " should strikes be carried out
@entity4 : chemical weapons -- how did we get here ? after last week 's attack , new dynamics the @entity4 conflict grew into a full - blown civil war after a fierce government crackdown started on civilian protesters in march 2011
as the crisis worsened , the @entity3 and other @entity113 countries embarked on diplomacy and shunned force to end the crisis , which has left more than 100,000 people dead and millions of civilians displaced , according to the @entity26
but the attack on the outskirts of @entity30 last week appeared to have changed the dynamics and put the possibility of force front and center
what justifies intervening if @entity4 uses chemical weapons ? the @entity14 government , @entity4 rebels say , used chemical weapons in the attack and killed more than 1,300 people
@entity3 president @entity132 said last year that the movement or use of chemical weaponry in @entity4 would represent a " red line " in the conflict
the @entity3 has deployed warships off the coast of @entity4 , and @entity113 powers say a strike on @entity4 could be imminent after reports of a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds
along with @entity7 , @entity145 has criticized the idea of a strike in @entity4
@entity145 foreign minister @entity148 said there 's no proof yet @entity4 's government is behind last week 's chemical attack
the @entity145 @entity153 accused @entity154 of trying to " create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention
" " the @entity159 handles the @entity161 world the way a monkey handles a grenade , " @entity145 deputy prime minister @entity157 said on @entity158
@entity7 and @entity4 : allies for years @entity7 's support for @entity4 has been " unwavering , " according to @entity167 , who wrote an essay about the relationship for the @entity170 at @entity171
" mutual contempt for @entity173 's @entity57 brought @entity4 and @entity7 together in 1980 and mutual fear and loathing of the @entity3 and @entity176 has helped sustain their alliance , " he wrote
he noted that @entity4 has been @entity7 's " only consistent ally since the 1979 @entity161 resolution " and has been a " geographic thoroughfare " to @entity180 , the @entity182 @entity181 militia -- " one of the crown jewels of the @entity40 revolution
" @entity7 is the world 's most populous @entity181 nation and is led by @entity181 religious authorities
the @entity4 government is dominated by @entity190 , a @entity181 offshoot , and the rebels are dominated by @entity193
" @entity40 motivations in keeping the @entity14 regime in power are also driven by deep concerns about the composition of a @entity200 government
given @entity4 's overwhelming @entity193 demographic majority , @entity7 fears the prospect of @entity4 being rendered a @entity193 sectarian regime aligned with @entity204 or the @entity3 and hostile to @entity7 , " @entity167 said
what happens if the regime " loses @entity30 " ? should @entity7 " preserve a sphere of influence by supporting a predominantly @entity190 militia representing only a small fraction of @entity4 society , or to befriend the @entity193 rebels poised to wield authority in @entity30 ? " " contrary to conventional wisdom , what is most important for @entity7 is not the sectarian composition of @entity4 's future leaders , but a like - minded ideological worldview premised on resistance to the @entity3 and @entity176 , " @entity167 wrote .
