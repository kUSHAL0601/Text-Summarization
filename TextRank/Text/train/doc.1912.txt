-- @entity1 started logrolling when she was 7
her parents signed her up for a class at the local @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , and she loved everything about it : the battle of strength , balance and agility between two opponents trying to stay on a log in the middle of a lake
" it sounds absolutely silly , but it 's a serious sport , " @entity1 says
serious enough to make her a six - time world lumberjack champion -- and give her a serious six - pack
@entity1 became a professional " lumberjill " when she was 17 , and has spent the last decade and a half traveling the world , competing in lumberjack competitions
next up is the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity6 , this week
she 'll be competing in the logrolling and boom run events
in logrolling , two lumberjacks fight to roll their opponent off a log that is 12 to 14 inches in diameter ( depending on the competition )
evenly matched pairs can stay on for more than seven minutes , @entity1 says
" you need every single muscle in your body ... if you get tired your technique goes out the door , " she says
" one little misstep and its over
" in the boom run , competitors race across logs chained together on the water
you 're allowed two falls in the timed event
it 's one of the more dangerous lumberjack sports
@entity51 , @entity1 says , is one of the safest
there are programs dedicated to the sport across @entity6 , and in other states such as @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59
@entity1 coaches hundreds of children each year
" ( the kids ) do n't realize they 're exercising , they 're having so much fun , " she says
" and they 're doing something totally unique
" it 's a way for @entity1 to give back
her mother was diagnosed with @entity66 , a degenerative brain disorder , when @entity1 was 5 years old
her parents wanted to keep life as normal as possible , so they told her to pick a few sports from a @entity4 catalog
@entity51 became @entity1 's escape from being a caregiver
" i was allowed two to three hours every day after school to just do sports and to be myself and to not think about my mom 's sickness , " she says
" it was never ever about winning
it was that time to go there , to be with my friends , to be stupid , to get yelled at by my coach
... that kept me going through all those tough years
" during competition season , @entity1 is on the water nearly every day
she also does resistance training several times a week and hill sprints to increase her endurance and speed
she sticks to lean meats , produce and good carbohydrates to stay energized
@entity1 knows not every child will fall in love with lumberjack sports like she did
the key to fighting childhood obesity , she says , is to find something that inspires them , whether it 's logrolling , rock climbing or ballet
" when they see fitness they immediately think ( of ) lifting weights , running marathons -- doing things they do n't enjoy
but the options are endless
