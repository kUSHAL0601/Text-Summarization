@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has stepped up activity at its main nuclear test site , possibly preparing to carry out a fourth underground blast , @entity1 said tuesday
the report comes just days before @entity9 president @entity8 is due to arrive in @entity1 as part of a visit to several @entity13 countries
" we confirm that we have spotted several activities related to the nuclear test in @entity18 in @entity3 , " the @entity14 said in a statement
it declined to specify what the activities were , saying the information was classified
the ministry said it had increased its military preparedness since monday morning and was monitoring around the clock for signs of activity at the @entity27 in a northeastern region of @entity3
@entity3 said last month that it would n't rule " a new form of a nuclear test " to strengthen its nuclear deterrent
experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb
3 previous tests the reclusive regime in @entity38 is known to have conducted three previous tests , all of them believed to be based on plutonium
the most recent one took place february 2013
the past tests prompted international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions aimed at hampering the @entity3 's weapons program
since the last underground detonation , @entity1 officials have repeatedly said that they believe @entity3 is ready to carry out another test at any time , pending a political decision to go ahead with it
" a lot of activity is currently being seen , so our forces are keeping in mind the possibility that @entity3 may suddenly conduct a nuclear test in a short period of time , or as in previous cases , deceive us with what appears to be a nuclear test , " @entity55 , a spokesman for the @entity14 said tuesday , according to the local news agency @entity56
@entity8 visit ' dangerous ' the reports of activity come ahead of @entity8 's @entity1 visit , which begins friday
the @entity3 @entity71 on monday described @entity8 's trip as " a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region
" @entity3 leader @entity78 's regime carried out a series of missile and rocket launches in march , prompting condemnation from the @entity83
an artillery exercise on march 31 near the border with @entity1 resulted in a brief exchange of fire between the two sides after @entity3 ordnance landed in @entity1 waters
@entity3 's series of provocative acts were seen as a response to joint @entity9 - @entity1 military drills in the region
the exercises take place each spring and regularly draw angry reactions from @entity38
are suspected @entity3 drones a threat to @entity1 ? @entity2 's @entity101 reported and wrote from @entity102 , and journalist @entity103 reported from @entity0 .
