@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 accused of hacking into @entity5 government computers on friday lost his court appeal to have his case heard in @entity8 , his legal team said
briton @entity10 is accused of carrying out the biggest ever @entity5 military hacking operation
the decision means @entity10 faces extradition to the @entity5 , where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into computers at the @entity15 and @entity16
his mother , @entity17 , promised to appeal
@entity10 , who has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to computer systems , wanted to be tried in @entity8 rather than the @entity5
he planned to ask judges at the @entity22 in @entity1 to review a recent decision by the director of public prosecutions not to pursue legal action in @entity8 , a spokeswoman at the prosecutor 's office told @entity2 july
the prosecutor 's decision effectively cleared the way for @entity10 's extradition
the @entity5 government says @entity10 carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time , accessing 97 computers from his home in @entity1 for a year starting in march 2001 and costing the government about $ 1 million
@entity10 , currently free on bail in @entity0 , has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the @entity5 government was covering up the existence of @entity42
prosecutors in the @entity5 and @entity8 disagree
" these were not random experiments in computer hacking , but a deliberate effort to breach @entity5 defense systems at a critical time which caused well - documented damage , " @entity44 of the @entity45 said in february
" they may have been conducted from mr. @entity10 's home computer -- and in that sense there is a @entity8 link -- but the target and the damage were trans - @entity58
" @entity5 federal prosecutors accuse @entity10 of breaking into military , @entity16 and civilian networks and accessing computers at the @entity15 ; @entity63 , @entity64 ; @entity65 , @entity66 ; the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 ; and the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , among others
in one case , @entity10 allegedly crashed computers belonging to the @entity76
@entity10 is believed to have acted alone , with no known connection to any terrorist organization , said @entity79 , the former @entity5 attorney for the @entity80
a @entity5 federal grand jury indicted @entity10 on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity
if convicted , he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $ 250,000 fine
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity89 , complained that the @entity5 has never provided evidence to prosecutors or @entity10 's legal team to support their extradition request -- and in fact , under @entity8 's @entity95 of 2003 , @entity5 prosecutors are not required to
@entity10 has previously said it was easy for him to access the secret files
" i did occasionally leave messages in system administrators ' machines saying , ' this is ridiculous , ' " @entity10 has said
" ( i left ) some political diatribes as well , but also a pointer to say , you know , this is ridiculous
" @entity10 was on the brink of extradition in august 2008 , when the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the @entity5 , effectively clearing the way for his transfer
shortly after that decision , however , @entity10 was diagnosed with asperger syndrome , and he claims that diagnosis changed the case for extradition
it was on that basis that @entity10 made his appeals in @entity8
asperger syndrome is a form of autism that affects a person 's social communication and interaction , according to @entity8 's @entity128
those affected often are of above - average intelligence and have fewer problems speaking than do those with autism
they sometimes have difficulty knowing when to start or end a conversation and can be very literal in what they say , with difficulty understanding jokes , metaphors and sarcasm .
