-- " birdman " flew high at the nominations for the 72nd @entity2
the film , starring @entity5 as a former superhero - playing actor trying to recharge his career with a @entity10 play , was nominated for seven @entity2 on thursday morning , leading all films

" full list of nominations the best drama nominees are " boyhood , " " @entity32 , " " @entity28 , " " @entity33 " and " @entity34
" the best comedy or musical nominees are " birdman , " " @entity38 , " " @entity39 , " " @entity40 " and " @entity41
" the @entity2 , put on by the @entity42 , are one of the many tea leaves awards - season watchers examine in order to determine which way the wind is blowing for the big prize , the @entity50
it also makes for a dandy tv show , as the alcohol flows freely and the winners are usually fairly loose ( and sometimes loose - lipped )
@entity55 and @entity56 , who have been highly praised for their sharp hosting of the show in recent years , will return again for the 2015 edition
@entity61 looking strong some films were boosted by the @entity2 ' division of films into dramas and comedy / musicals
" @entity39 , " director @entity69 's movie about a high - class @entity71 lodge between the world wars , was nominated for four globes , including nods for best comedy or musical , director , star @entity78 and screenplay
" @entity40 , " starring @entity84 as a curmudgeonly old man who takes charge of a 12 - year - old boy , earned two nominations , for best comedy or musical and @entity84 's performance
@entity61 is now looking like an @entity50 contender , thanks to a nomination for best actress in a drama for " cake
" she was also nominated for a @entity96 on wednesday
@entity97 picked up two nominations : one for her performance in the drama " @entity99 " and the other for best supporting actress in " @entity102
" the latter , the new @entity105 movie , also earned @entity97 an honor at the @entity107 this year
" @entity33 " received nominations for best drama , actor ( @entity111 ) , director ( @entity113 ) and song ( " glory " )
" @entity115 's " songwriters , @entity117 and @entity118 , were pleased with the attention
" we 're @entity2 nominated ! @ common and i wrote ' glory ' for @ @entity123 's beautiful @ @entity124
now we 're nominated for @entity125 ! " legend exulted on @entity127
" interstellar , " @entity130 's polarizing film about a trip to the far reaches of the universe , received just one nomination , for @entity136 's score
" @entity140 , " the new film by much - lauded director @entity142 , also got just one nomination , for @entity139 's lead performance
and " @entity146 , " a @entity148 film starring @entity149 , came up with nothing , as did @entity145 's " @entity144
" several directors also found themselves squeezed off the list , including " @entity32 's " @entity152 , " @entity28 's " @entity153 and " @entity34 's " @entity154
' @entity155 ' tops tv shows the @entity2 also go out to television shows
" @entity155 " led all nominees with five nominations , followed by " true detective " with four
" @entity161 " received two
" wow ! normally when your phone starts ringing that early in the morning , something bad happened
honored , " tweeted " @entity155 's " @entity165
with " @entity167 " now off the air , the drama race seemed open to some new candidates -- but only " @entity170 , " the @entity172 series about a troubled extramarital relationship , squeaked in
the other nominees -- " @entity175 , " " @entity176 , " " @entity177 " and " @entity178 " -- are familiar , though " @entity175 " had n't made the cut since 2012
that was " @entity182 ' " only nomination , however
the comedy series nominations went to " girls , " " @entity185 , " " @entity161 , " " @entity186 " and " transparent
" the latter marks @entity190 's first @entity2 nomination
perhaps more surprising were the shows that came up empty
" @entity193 , " last year 's best comedy series winner , did n't get a single nomination
neither did " @entity196 " or " @entity197
" " scandal " was also left out entirely ; not even its star , @entity198 , who received a nomination last year , nabbed a nomination
however , producer @entity204 ' new show , " how to @entity205 , " earned a nomination for star @entity207
not that " scandal " star @entity208 minded
he puckishly thanked the @entity42 for a nomination he did n't receive
" thrilled to have been nominated for my first @entity2 ! thanks , foreigners ! # scandal # humbled # @entity213 , " he tweeted
the 72nd @entity2 will air january 11 on @entity214 .
