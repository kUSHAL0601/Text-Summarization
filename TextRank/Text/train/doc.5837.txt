-- @entity3 , the widow of singer @entity4 and mother of singer @entity6 , died tuesday after a short battle with cancer , her family said
" our mom was in a class all by herself , " her three children said in a statement thursday
" she epitomized , class , elegance , and truly defined what it is to be a real lady
we are so blessed and privileged to have inherited the legacy that she leaves behind along with our father
she died how she lived -- with great strength , courage and dignity , surrounded by her loving family
" @entity3 , a jazz singer when she married @entity4 in 1948 , was known for her strength as her husband 's stardom rose and racial threats increased
" there were refusals at hotels , there were places we 'd go he would n't let me get out of the car because they would go in first to see if we could get the rooms , " @entity3 told @entity0 in an interview last year
" he did n't want me embarrassed with him
" she dealt with hatred from her neighbors when her family bought a home in @entity39 , then an exclusive all - white neighborhood next to @entity41 , @entity42 , soon after her 1948 marriage
" there were no jews or blacks there and they just almost had a stroke , " she said
" and i did n't care if they did
" despite efforts to force the @entity4 family to move , " we stayed there and we gave them tit for tat , " she said
her husband , though , " was not an activist , " she explained
" he did n't have an antagonistic bone in his body , " she said
" he should have had a few , but my husband was not a fighter
" " i loved him dearly , but we were exact opposites , " she said
" i admired him for his strength and his talent
he did n't say a lot
he was criticized by some of his own people because of it , you know
" @entity3 was also at his side when @entity4 's groundbreaking television show , launched in 1957 , folded after only a year because no national advertiser would risk a @entity74 boycott by sponsoring the first program hosted by an @entity76
" @entity82 is afraid of the dark , " @entity4 said after quitting the show , making reference to the street in @entity80 on which many advertising firms were located
@entity4 's widow reflected on that comment in last year 's interview
" is n't that a wonderful line ? " @entity3 said
" @entity82 was afraid of the dark in so many ways
the fact that he was black , the fact that they just do n't seem to know what 's going on
" the show drew a who 's who of @entity41 stars -- entertainers who wanted to make the first national show with an @entity76 host a success
" every one of them came on there saying , ' we 'll do it , we 'll show them , ' " she said
" it was that feeling among all of them
" @entity3 was partial to the shows with the @entity111 and @entity112 , who she said was " the greatest singer , as far as i 'm concerned
" the failure to get a national sponsor left her husband " very disappointed
" " he really thought he could change things , " @entity3 said
" he just really thought the show was going to change things
" after a year , @entity4 decided to quit , she said
" it was hard for him , very hard , " @entity4 's widow said
" he said , ' no , i ca n't do it anymore
i wo n't do it
' " in her last interview with @entity0 , in february 2011 , the 46th anniversary of her husband 's death , @entity3 said she wanted fans to remember her husband for his talent
" it was a very unusual talent , " she said
" i remember reading where @entity133 said ' we ai n't likely ever to see another one like him
' " @entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .
