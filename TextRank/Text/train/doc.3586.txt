-- should you tell your kids ? this is the question all of us are grappling with this morning
the horrific @entity6 school shooting is inescapable on the news today , and will be for a while -- a constant thrum of horror in our hearts and our souls
but we 're grown ups
we 'll grieve and process and move on
still that one nagging concern remains for many of us : do we tell our kids what happened or not ? if the news is a steady presence in your home , chances are they 'll glom on to the fact that something is up
if we do n't tell them and get the facts straight , they 'll probably hear some version of the truth at school
but to tell them this ? how ? " adults like to have all the information and try to make sense of the horribleness
but for kids , it 's too much , " says dr @entity37 , pediatrician , author , health journalist , and ceo of @entity41 now
" we have to balance our need to keep up with our need to protect our kids
" when will these school shootings stop ? bearing that in mind , @entity37 , a member of @entity48 's @entity47 , has a handful of tips on whether -- and how --- to talk to your children about what happened yesterday
the ages of your kids will drive whether , and what , you tell them about @entity6
" the first rule of thumb , though , is never lie to your kids , " says @entity37
" if they come home and ask you about it , no matter what age they are , tell them the truth
if they 're 4 or 6 or 8 and they ask ' was there a school shooting and did people die ? ' your answer has to be yes
" then you reassure them
tell them that their school is safe , that your community is different , that there are protections in place and it will never happen to them
" even if you 're not sure that 's true , you have to make sure that they believe it
they have to go to school every day
" how to help survivors of the @entity6 shooting ask your kids what they 've heard
even if they do n't ask you about @entity92 , they do go to school with older kids
children catch wind fairly quickly when something serious is up
some kids will luck out and not hear anything at all
but the news flows like water -- it gets through cracks you do n't even know are there
and facts get twisted on the playground
" the only way you 're going to know if your kids have heard something is if you ask them , " says @entity37
when they 're as young as 4 , do n't bring it up
but a 7 - year - old will possibly have heard something
approach her during a quiet moment or at snack time , says @entity37
say something like " there 's been a lot of talk in our country that about something that happened at a school in @entity124 that was very upsetting
has anybody talked about that at school ? " if they have n't heard , let them know they can ask you anything they want
a @entity135 survivor , thankful for how much she still has remain calm
if you do tell them what happened , make sure you 're coming from your calmest , most reassuring place
" do n't overload them
do n't go on a whole speech about gun control or school safety , " says @entity37
they 're children and they may not know how to respond right away
they may look at you and go out of the room and do something else
maybe they 'll come back and ask questions later , maybe they wo n't
" allow them to have whatever response they have unless it 's interfering with their ability to go through the day , it 's all expected , " says @entity37
if the news is interfering with your kids or anyone in your family , " seek help right away , " @entity37 advises
this will usually manifest in a lot of anxiety and a lot of grief , anxiousness about the safety of their family
in more serious cases , physical symptoms could include headaches , stomach aches , inability to function as usual or a reluctance to go to school
" this is n't something you 'd want to wait out
" how to deal with nightmares monitor the media intake for everyone in the family
even if you only watch @entity0 when the kids are in bed , there 's the chance they may not be able to get to sleep and can hear the newscaster , the interviews
coverage of events like this can range from incredibly tactful to incredibly sensational
be aware of who is watching what around the home , says @entity37
that goes for grown - ups too
" you do n't need to watch the news 24/7 , " she adds
" that creates overanxiety in all of us
that 's the best thing you can do to honor these people
