-- it 's hard to believe it 's been 30 years since @entity3 and @entity4 took a ride across the moon
as @entity10 , who played @entity4 in the movie " @entity3 , " said , " ironically enough , even with today 's technology and knowledge of movie magic , people still ask me how they made the bike fly
they used a blue screen and rear projection
it 's an old trick
" @entity20 's " @entity3 " was the biggest blockbuster of 1982 , winning four @entity19
it remains the fourth most - successful movie of all time in the @entity23 " @entity3 " even surpassed " @entity28 " as the highest - grossing film of all time and was n't beat until another @entity20 film came along : 1993 's " @entity27
" one of the reasons " @entity3 " remains timeless is because it was n't supposed to be an effects - heavy film
memorable visuals , like the bicycle scene , were seamlessly woven in
@entity20 did n't want audiences " ooohing " and " aaahing " over special effects
he simply wanted it to look like he 'd shot a perfect night moon , because he did just that
that was the real moon
the visual effects team spent several nights charting the moon and scouting locations for the perfect spot in the forest at the perfect time
@entity10 , who was 10 years old when he made " @entity3 , " said he 'll never forget the distinct smell of the @entity50 soundstage
" @entity51 have a very particular smell , " he explained , " and to this day whenever i have that , it takes me back to those days , because those are pretty much the first memories i have of working on a set
" @entity10 , now 41 , described the smell as " a combination of new lumber , cigarette smoke and fog machines
they used a lot of atmospheric fog
" he also recalled eating @entity64 by the fistful
in the film , @entity4 lures @entity3 into his house by leaving a trail of the candy
" i made myself sick from eating them because we always had those 2 - pound bags lying around , " @entity10 said
" they were set dressing in @entity4 's room , so in between takes , i was constantly eating those things
in fact , when i saw @entity20 -- we did an interview together earlier this year -- and when i saw him , i said something about how i ate too many of those things , and he said , ' oh , yeah , i know you did
you were eating those way too much
' " producers originally wanted to use @entity83 , but parent company @entity84 passed
on a more sentimental note , @entity10 believes that the reason " @entity3 " still resonates with audiences today is because " people respond to the message of compassion and friendship
it 's a simple , very human thing
" actress @entity93 , who played @entity4 's mother , @entity94 , said , " it 's our ' @entity96 , ' and it 's something that every generation wants to pass down to the next generation and share with it and tell the stories about
" @entity103 said she believes " @entity3 " remains a global cultural phenomenon because " it 's all about love and keeping your heart open
and when you do that , even the little alien from outer space can be your best friend
" in a recent interview featured on the new 30th anniversary " @entity3 " blu - ray / dvd , @entity20 said that the idea for " @entity3 " came to him when he was directing 1977 's " @entity119
" he thought of doing a scenario where the alien did n't return to the mothership
he 'd also wanted to make a film exploring how divorce impacts pre-teens
( the director himself endured his own parents ' divorce when he was 15
) so in collaboration with screenwriter @entity131 , @entity20 combined those two ideas to create " @entity3 's " sweet story about a lonesome boy rescued -- by an alien -- from the sadness of his parents ' divorce
referring to " @entity3 " as " the most personal thing i 'd done as a director , " @entity20 stated that his intention all along was to tell the tale from the kids ' points of view
except for @entity103 's character , " all the other adults are either silhouetted , shot at a long distance or from the waist down , " said @entity20 , " until the critical moment where @entity3 is dying , and then for the first time , we see the character of @entity152
" @entity20 also noted that working with @entity10 , a then - 6 - year - old @entity153 ( @entity154 ) and 15 - year - old @entity155 ( @entity156 ) made him want to be a father
the director recalled viewing a number of early concept sketches before committing to @entity3 's look
he was adamant that the little alien not resemble a monster
interestingly enough , the director envisioned a combination of @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , because he wanted @entity3 's oversized eyes to look " as wizened and as sad as those icons
" @entity3 began shooting in september 1981 and wrapped that december
it was filmed under the code name " @entity3 " because @entity20 feared plagiarism of the plot
actors were instructed to read the script behind closed doors ; everyone on - set had to wear an id card
most of @entity3 's voice work was performed by an elderly woman named @entity181 , whose two - pack a day smoking habit gave her voice the deep quality @entity20 had envisioned
however , there were 18 contributors to @entity3 's voice in total
to create sounds ranging from @entity3 talking and breathing to snorting and drunkenly burping , the contributors included @entity20 himself , sound effects creator @entity190 's sleeping wife who had a cold , a burp from a @entity194 film professor , raccoons , sea otters , horses and actress @entity199 's signature husky voice
( you ca n't make this stuff up
) @entity199 also has a cameo in " @entity3 " during the trick - or - treating scene
she 's dressed as a doctor wearing a monster mask carrying a poodle in a clown costume
( you really ca n't make this stuff up
) @entity20 gave @entity199 the " @entity3 " script and had her record every single one of @entity3 's lines into a tape recorder
in the scene where government agents have taken over @entity4 's home , real doctors from @entity216 were recruited to play the doctors who try to save @entity3 , because @entity20 felt that actors talking about technical medical matters did n't seem natural
in addition , @entity20 cut a scene featuring @entity225 as the headmaster at @entity4 's school
@entity20 recalled receiving " stacks " of congratulatory telegrams upon " @entity3 's " premiere during the @entity229 in june 1982 , but the most treasured one came from @entity233 , who said , " you belong here more than me
" at a @entity237 screening , @entity20 sat next to president @entity238 and noted that " the president 's face became very childlike
his mouth was open , his eyes were wide , and i suddenly saw a 10 - year - old boy
" @entity10 added that he is " pleasantly surprised " by the film 's resonating success
" i never really thought when we were filming that it would ever be a success
it literally took until about 10 years ago for me to realize , ' wow ! this " @entity3 " thing is n't going away
