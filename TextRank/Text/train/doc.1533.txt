although you may think that bottled water is a safer option than tap , two new reports show that the store - bought stuff is actually less regulated than the water you get out of your faucet for free
what 's in your water ? you may be hard pressed to find out , reports the @entity11
the @entity12 has little authority to regulate bottled brands , according to a @entity16 congressional report released recently
while municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results , bottled - water makers are not
( on the other hand , well water , which is found in many rural areas , is n't regulated as water provided by towns and cities is
) so although you may fork over a pretty penny for bottled water , that does n't mean it 's any better than what 's coming out of your faucet
in fact , it could be worse and you 'd never know it
the new research is backed by a second report from the @entity11
the nonprofit advocacy organization surveyed the labels and web sites of nearly 200 popular bottled - water brands and found that less than 2 percent disclosed three important facts that can affect safety : the water 's source , purification methods , and chemical pollutants in each bottle
( see the full report on bottled water at @entity11 's web site
) " we 're really pushing for a consumer 's right to know what 's in their water , " says @entity54 , an environmental health researcher at the @entity11
" this is n't a doomsday scenario
it is n't that the claims are false ; it 's just that they are misleading
" reaching for the most popular bottled brands is n't necessarily a solution
in fact , the @entity11 report found that some of the best - known brands -- for example @entity75 and @entity76 -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains
@entity80 : plastic recycling gets easier " this probably has to do with the fact that they 're imported , so the regulations are different , " says @entity54
" some of the brands you think would n't be as transparent , like @entity88 or @entity89 , scored higher than many of the popular brands
" so what 's a safety - conscious shopper to do ? in recent years , some reports have suggested that tap water could be contaminated by trace amounts of pharmaceuticals or other substances
@entity80 : why caffeine and sugar are poor substitutes for sleep @entity54 says that activated carbon water filters -- like @entity106 pitchers or faucet attachments -- are a safe and affordable option for filtering tap water
if families can afford it , she recommends a reverse osmosis filter , which will eliminate all impurities
these reports come as food safety concerns seem to be at an all - time high
lately , recalls of spinach , sprouts , peanut butter , and , most recently , cookie dough have made many consumers start to question the safety of the items they find on grocery - store shelves
unlike tap water suppliers , bottled water companies do n't have to have their water tested by a certified laboratory , and they are n't required to notify customers within 24 hours if they find elevated levels of contaminants
the @entity12 does require bottled water companies to test for contaminants and other problems , says @entity135 , @entity136 , the agency 's principal deputy commissioner
@entity80 : could your rug make you sick ? if the companies fail , however , the public does n't get to see the actual test results
" there 's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water , but the @entity12 's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information , " says @entity135
" it 's not a question of whether the @entity12 can do more ; it 's whether the government can do more through the food safety bill
" only changes in the current regulations would make it mandatory for manufacturers to make those kinds of records public , he says
those regulations may change with the @entity165
@entity80 : drink this tea to lose that belly the proposed @entity165 covers many aspects of food safety , including better preventive control measures by food manufacturers , more frequent inspections of facilities , and greater @entity12 authority over food recalls
