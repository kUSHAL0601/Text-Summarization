-- this time of the year , even the youngest children know something is up
there 's a running stream of political advertisements on television , mail flyers with smiling politicians asking for our vote and the ubiquitous bumper stickers on cars
you can tell when children are getting their daily dose of politics the moment they start parroting back " i 'm @entity20 / @entity19 , and i approve this message
" but making sense of the electoral process can be overwhelming for children
" one of the problems is civics is not taught adequately in schools
a @entity34 system relies on an enlightened citizenry , as @entity36 said , to meet its goals , " says @entity29 of the @entity30 , a non-profit , non-partisan organization that promotes civic education
schools used to spend more time teaching children about the political process in class
but national education reform 's mandate for high - stakes testing has teachers and school administrators now placing more emphasis on math and language arts at the expense of political science , explains @entity29
the 2010 @entity52 , also known as the @entity53 , found the civics performance of twelfth - graders has been slipping
only 64 percent of high school seniors were performing at or above basic level
achievement by @entity60 4th graders in civics was slightly better , with 77 percent at or above basic levels
where to start ? @entity29 says parents can start in kindergarten talking about fairness and justice , why we need positions of authority and rules , what makes a good rule , individual responsibility and rights and the common good
" start early and build through the school years , and you will end up with an enlightened citizenry , " @entity29 said
the @entity30 provides lesson plans and discussion topics for parents and teachers
@entity84 , the world 's largest publisher and distributor of children 's books , offers a political website geared for children with biographical information on the candidates , an election timeline , extensive teaching tools and games for children
@entity84 also has student reporters who provide current coverage of the campaigns , debates and issues
children have a chance to cast their own " vote " in the presidential race on the @entity84 education site
since 1940 when @entity84 started the tradition , students have successfully picked the winning candidate of the general election all but twice ( exceptions : 1948 @entity112 vs. @entity113 and 1960 @entity114 )
" every election year we take it seriously to teach readers about the @entity124 , our @entity118 and how the system they put in place was so resilient it has lasted more than 200 years , " says @entity115 , @entity117 's editor - at - large
2012 elections : candidate and issue guide in addition to online resources , students can find valuable information through library books
@entity136 author and illustrator , @entity134 has written a book designed to get young students excited about the presidential race
his book " @entity142 for president " tracks the story of a cat running for the local @entity146
it 's part chapter book and part picture book
" i wanted to create a book that would be fun and interesting for kids about this whole process that this country goes through every four years that 's bizarre , chaotic and wonderful in how we elect a president , " says @entity134
@entity134 also visits elementary students around the country offering students a civics lesson
even though it will be years before they can actually vote , @entity134 says there is still a role they can play now
" they ca n't vote , but they can go up to mom or dad and say , ' have you registered to vote ? ' cause time is a-wastin ! ' " recommended books : " @entity142 for president " " the election book : the people pick a president ( updated ) " " @entity176 for president " " @entity178 " " like " @entity179 on @entity180 do you have any tips on educating kids about the electoral process ? share them in the comments section below .
