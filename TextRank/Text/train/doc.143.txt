-- along with the figure skating , ice hockey and snowboarding , another event will compete for attention at the @entity6 in @entity7 this month
a @entity7 company has created what it calls the " largest thought - controlled computing installation
" it 's an experiment that lets visitors to the @entity6 use their brainwaves to control the lights at three major landmarks in @entity7 , including @entity16
" when people put on the headsets and find themselves increasing the brightness of the lights by just thinking about it , you can almost see their brains explode , " says @entity17 , chief operating officer for @entity18 , the company that has created this installation
as consumers get more comfortable with going beyond the keyboard and the mouse to interact with their computers , companies are looking for alternate ways to make the experience better
already , touch and voice recognition have become a major part of the user interface in smartphones , and harnessing brainwaves or other biological data is slowly emerging as a third option , especially in gaming
companies such as @entity45 offer headphones that promise to translate the gamer 's brainwaves into action on screen
a biometrics company called @entity52 is helping @entity0 host a geeked - out @entity54 party
and even @entity55 is working on alternate forms of input ; its @entity58 promises to add gesture recognition to @entity61 games later this year
@entity18 's installation is spread across three sites : @entity65 's @entity64 , @entity67 's @entity66 and @entity16
all three locations have two chairs set up , each with its own headset
the headsets have an external probe that touches the wearer 's forehead to measure the baseline brain activity
the chairs are rigged to offer tactile feedback as users enter the desired brain state
the headset measures the brain 's electrical output and reacts to alpha waves , associated with relaxation , and beta waves , which indicate concentration
as users relax or focus their thoughts , the computer sends a message to the site they are viewing
@entity18 's software translates users ' thoughts to commands that will change the lighting display
for instance , by concentrating , users can make the lights at the @entity64 spin faster or change the brightness of the lights at @entity16
it 's easy enough once users get started , says @entity17
" to achieve the beta state we ask users to focus on things like an object ahead and its details , while for an alpha response we ask them to take a deep breath and relax to let their mind go , " he says
" but after a minute or two of trying it , we found most users no longer require the physical cues , " says @entity17
over the two weeks that the exhibit will be open , @entity18 expects more than 2,000 visitors to try it out
