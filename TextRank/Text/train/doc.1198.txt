-- a @entity2 politician critical of @entity4 drone strikes said saturday that @entity4 authorities detained and questioned him at a @entity7 airport
@entity8 , a former cricket star , this month led a march to the border of @entity2 's tribal region to protest drone strikes , which he says end up killing more civilians than militants
@entity8 said he boarded a @entity15 - bound plane in @entity16 on friday when two @entity4 immigration officials asked him to step outside
the officials made him wait for about 40 minutes before interviewing him for another 20 minutes , he said
" i kept asking them what was this all about , and then one guy interviewed me and he was so confused , he had no idea what he was saying , " @entity8 told @entity0 by phone from @entity20 , another stop on his trip
" he was talking about some fund - raising , so i asked him to come to the point , and he said , ' we 're worried you might use violence against drones
' i mean , it was so ridiculous , i did n't even know how to answer it
" @entity8 : " we 'll sweep the election " @entity8 missed his flight , but he eventually made it to @entity15 , and later @entity20 , for fund - raisers for his political party , @entity42
he has two more fund - raisers on the schedule , in @entity45 and @entity46 , before he returns home to @entity2 , @entity8 said
the cricket legend said he suspects @entity4 officials simply wanted to make him miss an anti-drone protest @entity8 was scheduled to lead in the @entity4 , without realizing the protest had already been postponed because of the @entity53 holiday of @entity54
a @entity56 official acknowledged that @entity8 was " briefly delayed " before boarding the next flight to the @entity4
" the issue was resolved , " the official said
" mr. @entity8 is welcome in the @entity4
" @entity8 has been a fierce critic of @entity4 policy in @entity2 and the use of drone strikes , calling them a violation of @entity2 's sovereignty and a strategy that stokes militant anger toward @entity67
in recent years , the @entity4 government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in @entity2 's mostly ungoverned tribal region , widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in @entity75
@entity4 officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare
anti-drone peace march halted in @entity2 @entity8 says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians
that , he said , is counterproductive to the war on terrorism
" if you alienate them , you lose the war , because they 're the ones who are going to eventually provide logistical support , " he said
" from these people will be the recruits to the militants
" @entity0 's @entity95 and @entity96 contributed to this report .
