-- airports are known for rules and regulations , a reputation that applies to the runways as well
almost all airport designs are governed by regulations established by the @entity8 to ensure pilots circling @entity10 or @entity11 remain properly oriented and deliver passengers and cargo safely
@entity14 turns those strictures into art , with the help of @entity18
the @entity20 - based designer has made a meticulous study of airport runways and logged the results on a @entity24 called @entity25
these views reveal beautiful compositions at airports that are nothing special at ground level
" i 've found even the most humdrum cities or outdated terminals can have beautiful compositions from bird 's - eye , " @entity31 says
" even @entity36 rocks ! " dozens of carefully cropped images reveal common traits among airports , and the logic and order embodied by seemingly random lines becomes clear
here are some tips to help make sense of the mishmash of lines and symbols you might see from seat @entity50
runway math airport runways are n't numbered based on priority , but compass bearings
a runway that is 194 ° away from magnetic north would be simplified to 190 ° to prevent rounding errors , and the last digit is dropped , leaving it at 19
fun fact : most runways are able to be used in both directions , and when approached from the opposite side the runway 's number is achieved by subtracting 18 or 180 °
flying @entity66 airports use a specialized font to number their runways
it 's highly geometric , which eliminates confusing curves and can be reduced to simple schematics , making it easy for groundskeepers lacking typographic training to recreate
the font apparently has no name , but the numbers are called " runway designators " in pilot parlance

many airports are built on soft soils , so a fully - loaded @entity98 , weighing 230 metric tons at takeoff , will sink into a patch of sod quickly , requiring hours of recovery , repair , and rerouting
@entity103 ! @entity103 ! not only does the @entity103 refuse to get on board with the metric system and day / month notation , but we ca n't even agree with anyone aside from the @entity109 on what to call the area of pavement where passengers get on and off the planes
from @entity116 in @entity117 to the @entity118 in central @entity119 , this area is called an apron
here in the states , we call it a ramp
whatever you do , do n't call it a tarmac unless it 's actually got a tar surface
@entity129 's @entity128 a runway , like most roads , has a center line
but there are plenty of markings unfamiliar to drivers
eight white bars that resemble piano keys mark the threshold and give pilots an indication of where it would be safe to touch down
two large white rectangles are the aiming points — the areas pilots should , well , aim for , followed by touchdown markers represented by four white bars
chevrons at the end of the runway mark the direction of a given strip , but if your plane hits one during takeoff or landing know that a disaster was narrowly averted

no pilots actually say this , but it 's good to know that if you see white lines and markings it means you 're en route to take off
if you see yellow lines and markings , you 're stuck on the taxiway
about the artist @entity31 always has lived under the flight paths of airports -- a tiny municipal airstrip in her hometown and @entity185 in @entity186 -- and grew fascinated by the cadence of departures and the changing flight paths over the course of the day
during a moment of wanderlust she opened @entity18 and started contemplating runway layouts from a birds - eye perspective
@entity31 traveled the globe , virtually , to create beautiful images based on bureaucratic design guidelines
with her art direction , @entity200 's broad expanses of dull grey concrete tiles became dynamic
her crop of a runway in @entity206 , @entity207 , laced with bright yellow lines became a work worthy of @entity210
and hidden treasures , like an inscription in honor of @entity214 , was uncovered in the aesthetic wasteland that is @entity216 's @entity216
each image starts with a clear itinerary , but @entity31 is open to diversions
" i 'm really drawn to the patterns , line work , and typography on the tarmac — especially as it contrasts with the geography , " she says
" i was really inspired by the @entity227 after mapping it for @entity25
everything seemed so considered and straightforward , which lent itself to stronger compositions , " she says
turns out , @entity232 is considered a textbook example of good runway design , known for maximizing the flow of air traffic in a compressed amount of space
