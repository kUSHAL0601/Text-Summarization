@entity0 's been a fictional hero for decades , but in @entity3 , @entity4 , today there 's a hero named @entity0 who is definitely real -- only he 's 8 years old and has four legs
this @entity0 , a @entity8 retriever - husky mix , is being hailed for pulling a 9 - year - old girl from an icy river on @entity11
his owner , @entity12 , 27 , is getting similar praise
" if that man and dog were n't there -- i just try not to think of it , " @entity17 , the mother of @entity19 , 9 , and her 10 - year - old sister , @entity20 , said in an interview with @entity23 affiliate @entity22
" i just want to give him a big hug and tell him he 's my hero
if he was n't there i would n't have my girls , " @entity28 said
" doctors said two more minutes and @entity33 would have been gone
" @entity0 and @entity12 's heroics played out on the icy @entity35 in @entity3 on sunday afternoon
the girls were tobogganing in a riverside park when they ended up on ice extending from the riverbank , their father , @entity36 , told @entity23 affiliate @entity41
" from what i was told was , one of the toboggans came off the snowbank and onto the ice and they were trying to come back and the ice broke , " he said
@entity12 said he was walking on a bridge over the river when he heard screams
looking down on the river he saw one girl in the icy water and her sister trying to pull her out
by the time he and @entity56 sprinted down to the river , both girls were in the water
he was able to pull @entity20 up onto the ice , but the current was carrying @entity33 downstream , about 4 or 5 feet from the edge of the ice , her head going in and out of the water , @entity12 told a press conference monday
he asked the girl if she could swim to him
" she said she could n't move her arms , could n't move her legs , " @entity12 said
he tried throwing @entity0 's leash to her but it did n't reach
then , as he tried to get closer , the ice gave way beneath him and his dog
" he managed to get his front paws on the ice and i pushed his back end up so he was on the ice , then i used the leash and him to kind of pull myself up onto the ice , " @entity12 said
by this time , @entity33 had drifted 50 or 60 yards farther down the river , still bobbing in and out of the ice - cold water
@entity12 and @entity0 ran to her again , but she was still out of reach
" i put the leash around @entity0 and pushed him to get in the water and i told her if she could get ahold of his leash , we could get her back to the ice , " @entity12 said
" he jumped in right beside her , " he said , and the girl managed to get both hands on @entity0 's leash
" i called him back and he swam toward the ice , " @entity12 said , getting close enough that he could grab both the girl 's arm and his dog and drag them away from the water 's edge
fire rescue crews arrived shortly thereafter and took the sisters for treatment
on monday , they were home with their grateful mother , and @entity12 and @entity0 were being honored at the fire station -- @entity12 with a fireman 's hat and @entity0 with a giant rawhide bone he grabbed from fire chief @entity109 before @entity109 could take off its plastic wrapper
" these two young ladies are very , very fortunate that such a family happened along and were able to intervene , " @entity109 said
@entity12 could n't dispute that
" i guess it 's just a bit of a miracle that everything worked out perfectly , " he told @entity22 .
