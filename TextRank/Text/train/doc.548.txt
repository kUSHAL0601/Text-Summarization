-- a 15 - year - old @entity3 boy who shot and killed himself last week with the family shotgun had sustained years of bullying , friends said monday
@entity6 committed suicide august 27 after attending the first day of his sophomore year at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity3
friends who knew @entity6 , a @entity11 immigrant , told @entity0 he was the target of bullies due to his size -- the teen was 6 feet , 3 inches tall -- and @entity11 accent
the friends described him as " a little awkward in his body " but said he was a " giant sweetheart " who related more with adults than his peers
@entity24 's 13 - year - old son @entity23 was good friends with @entity6 and the @entity27 family
she gave one of several eulogies at his funeral friday , saying , " @entity6 was one of the kindest kids i had ever met
... it was a life - changing friendship for @entity23
@entity6 was two years older , and he was so kind , funny , and refreshingly different from any kid @entity23 had ever been around
our family is absolutely devastated by the loss of @entity6 in our lives
" " he 's always been a quirky kid ... really sweet but really awkward
and that 's also why he and @entity23 clicked so well
even though they were different , they were similar in their manner
they were a little outside of the lines , " @entity24 said
@entity47 may face prosecution over bullied teenager 's suicide in @entity51 @entity24 confirmed to @entity0 that @entity6 had indeed been bullied for years and said that his family had done everything they could to inform the school district of the situation
@entity57 , communications director for the @entity58 , said the district is " looking at the entire history in his experiences in our school that is an ongoing investigation
" " he was a very quiet kid -- truly one of the nicest people i ever met in my life
i never once heard him say anything bad about anybody else
he was just kind of a really kindhearted person , " said @entity69 , 17 , a senior at @entity71 's school who knew him through @entity72
@entity24 said that @entity6 did not publicly exhibit any signs of a child in trouble
but after @entity6 's suicide , several posts came to light on @entity71 's social network site on @entity81 that appear to reveal his internal struggles
" hey if i were to stab my eye out due to school caused insanity , who would miss me ? " he posted in june alongside a photo of himself with a knife next to his eye
another post in june appeared to indicate he had attempted suicide by ingesting lighter fluid
@entity93 : @entity94 and nation grapple with teen bullies the following month he posted , " i notice if i sound sad i 'm normal and if i act happy , cheerful , and ' normal ' there is a high chance that i will try to poison myself , cut myself , commit suicide , or jump in front of a truck : ) " a group of @entity71 's classmates have formed a group using social media to provide peer - to - peer support anonymously for students struggling with bullying and other issues
" within the school students want to talk to other people who want to listen ... @entity9 administration has great staff and they have great social workers , but some people ca n't reach out to adults themselves but they can reach out to a fellow student who wants to help out , " said @entity113 , senior class vice president and one of the founders of the @entity47 group encouraging students to offer each other support
a preliminary investigation by the @entity125 found that the gun @entity6 used to kill himself was family owned and had been stored inside a gun locker in the home
" the incident continues to be investigated by members of the @entity133 , " a police statement said , declining to provide further information
@entity6 's family has flown back to @entity11 to bury him and was not available for comment monday , @entity24 told @entity0
why telling bullying victims to ' just fight back ' does n't work
