@entity0 -- @entity2 says she can finally get some rest now that it looks like she will be able to sell the @entity5 for $ 2 billion
but @entity7 's lawyers say this is just one battle in a war their client wants to continue waging
it appears , however , they are losing the war to keep the franchise @entity7 has owned for more than 30 years
a @entity15 probate judge ruled monday that a deal to sell the @entity18 team for a league - record price can move forward
judge @entity20 tentatively ruled in favor of @entity2 , saying the estranged wife of @entity7 acted properly in removing her husband from the trust that owns the @entity18 team and in winding up the affairs of the trust
the sale can go forward regardless of any appeals , @entity20 said
and @entity7 will appeal , his attorneys said
" his reaction is very calm
he did n't see this as the final battleground
this is one stage of a long war , " @entity33 said
the ruling is expected to become final in about 10 days , after @entity7 's lawyers are allowed to enter their objections to the judgment
@entity1 legal analyst @entity39 said it is unlikely that @entity7 's lawyers will succeed if they appeal the final ruling
appellate courts are very reluctant to overturn a probate judge 's decision on the facts , she said
@entity18 pleased former @entity48 ceo @entity47 has agreed with @entity2 to buy the @entity5 for a league record $ 2 billion
" we are pleased that the court has affirmed @entity2 's right to sell the @entity5 to @entity47 , " the @entity18 said through spokesman @entity50
" we look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible
" @entity54 , an attorney for @entity2 , said they hoped to have the sale completed by august 13
" this is going to be a good thing for the city , for the league , for my family , for all of us , " said @entity2 , who added she will still be sitting courtside next season
" and come see the @entity5 next year ! " she called @entity47 the " best new owner that anybody could ever find
" she said that she had n't slept well for two months
" i 'm just glad it 's over , " she said
doctors ruled @entity7 was mentally incapacitated @entity2 was within her rights to remove her husband from the trust under which each @entity7 had owned 50 % of the team , the judge agreed
she became sole trustee in may after two doctors determined @entity7 was mentally incapacitated
in april , @entity7 , 80 , came under fire for making racist remarks against african - americans in comments to his companion @entity78
the recorded conversation was published online
in response , the @entity18 banned @entity81 for life , fined him the maximum $ 2.5 million and moved toward terminating the @entity81 ' ownership rights in the franchise
@entity7 , in turn , sued the league for $ 1 billion for alleged antitrust violations in its handling of the matter
@entity33 said they would switch their focus to this case
@entity7 also is suing @entity2 and @entity18 commissioner @entity94 , seeking monetary damages in civil court
court documents filed by @entity7 's attorneys call the potential deal " unlawful " and " fraudulent , " and ask for an injunction to block the sale
@entity7 revoked the family trust in june , and the lawsuit contends that the move reverted the @entity5 back to his sole ownership and therefore @entity2 has no power or right to sell the team
all the stock for the franchise was issued in his name , court documents said
@entity7 has said he will never sell the @entity5
the @entity18 board of governors , a group of the league 's 30 owners , will also have to approve the sale for it to go through
@entity7 bought the @entity5 in 1981 for about $ 12 million and is the longest - tenured owner in the @entity18
@entity7 sues wife , @entity18 and commissioner
