@entity0 , @entity1 -- actress @entity3 showed little emotion as a deputy put her in handcuffs in a @entity8 , @entity1 , courtroom tuesday morning to take her to jail to begin what it expected to be a two - week stay
the actress , wearing a top that exposed part of her back , was surrounded by deputies and was quickly walked to a nearby side door labeled " secure area
" " we love you , @entity3 , " her father , @entity19 , said as she disappeared
@entity3 was " cooperative " as she was booked into the @entity22 about an hour later , according to @entity24 's spokesman @entity23
superior court judge @entity25 had ordered @entity3 to report to the courtroom to begin serving a sentence for a probation violation
@entity29 ordered that @entity3 not be allowed to leave jail on a work - release or house - release program or with electronic monitoring during her sentence
the judge said , however , she has no control over how much of the 90 - day sentence @entity3 will end up serving
the sheriff , who runs the jail , has the power to release prisoners early because of jail overcrowding
@entity3 should be released from jail after between 13 to 15 days " unless something unusual happens , " @entity23 said
he said it was routine for inmates who qualify for good behavior credits in jail to only serve 25 percent of their sentence
@entity3 must enter a substance - abuse rehabilitation program within 24 hours of leaving jail , @entity29 said
" i would like the transition to be sooner rather than later , " she said
the judge placed tight restrictions on what the public would be able to see at tuesday 's hearing
while the world watched as @entity3 , 24 , broke down in tears at her sentencing july 6 , the public was not able to see the actress handcuffed and taken into custody tuesday
cameras stopped rolling when the judge announced that @entity3 was to be taken into custody
the judge also ordered that photos of @entity3 must be restricted to those that showed her at the counsel table
the actress was ordered to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation
she was also sentenced to spend 90 days in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation program after her jail term is completed
@entity3 's next court date will come a week after her release from jail , although if she is in a rehab program her lawyer can appear without her , the judge said
@entity19 , whose estrangement from his daughter has been very public , sat two rows behind @entity3 during the sentencing
his lawyer told reporters after the hearing that he was " devastated " that she was going to jail
the actress will be " treated just as any other " inmate in the jail , although she will have her own cell and remain apart from the general inmate population , the sheriff 's spokesman said
@entity3 was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence , and in the second incident she was charged with cocaine possession
the first arrest came after @entity3 lost control of her @entity108 convertible and struck a curb in @entity8
just two weeks after checking out of a @entity112 drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility , she was arrested again in july 2007 after a woman called @entity115 police , saying @entity3 was trying to run her down with a car
@entity3 's acting career , which started at age 10 on a soap opera , took off on the big screen a year later , when she played identical twins in @entity123 's remake of " @entity124
" @entity2 's @entity125 , @entity126 and in @entity128 's @entity127 contributed to this report
