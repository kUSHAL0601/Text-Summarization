@entity0 -- more than three weeks after seven @entity3 men went missing when the fishing vessel @entity7 sank in @entity9 's @entity8 , the families of the missing @entity5 are expressing anger with the @entity5 and @entity9 governments for not conducting a dive to find the sunken boat -- and possibly the bodies entombed beneath the sea
the sinking of the 115 - foot sport fishing boat during a predawn storm on july 3 captured widespread attention because the 27 passengers were nearly all friends and acquaintances who fished on the @entity7 as an annual outing , some for as long as 15 years or so
all were from northern @entity3 , relatives said
only five of them were first - timers on a five - night trip aboard the @entity7 , during which the sportsmen would venture deep into the sea aboard smaller pangas in search of yellowfin tuna and dorado , relatives said
most of the 27 were @entity38 - @entity5 men from the @entity39 and nearby , relatives said
those close ties heightened the depth of the tragedy , especially as @entity5 and @entity9 authorities spent nine days searching the vast expanse of the @entity8
in addition to the seven missing men , @entity45 , 63 , died in the incident
among the survivors , several were rescued from a @entity9 beach
one person was rescued from a coastal island
the families have expressed frustration with the investigation
a @entity57 official said the @entity58 and the @entity59 are helping @entity9 authorities with the probe
still , the families say they are disturbed that there was apparently no mayday issued during the sinking of the @entity7
also , the boat apparently did n't carry a satellite tracking device that 's often deployed when a boat is in distress , relatives say
in their social media and website campaign to attract public attention to their plight , the families have become so exasperated with the two governments ' apparent reluctance to conduct a dive 200 feet beneath the sea that they are trying to raise money to execute a privately funded dive -- if they can raise enough funds on their " @entity86 " website and if the @entity9 government will allow the dive
the families are haunted by unanswered questions , their representatives say : did the 16 - member crew abandon ship without trying to help the passengers ? did the vessel have enough life preservers ? why did it take 16 hours before a search and rescue was launched ? " we do n't want any other families to go through the pain we went through
this should not have happened at all , " said may @entity103 , @entity3
her husband , @entity105 , 62 , an assistant parts manager at @entity107 in nearby @entity108 , is among the seven missing
" there 's still a little bit of me that 's hoping my husband is on some remote little island with some of his buddies , " @entity103 told @entity1 on tuesday
but the families have become demoralized
on sunday , they will gather for the first time since the accident ; at a hotel in northern @entity3 , @entity103 said
" some of them are very depressed , but i 'm doing my darnedest to try to bring people together
i 'm trying to give them as much hope as possible , to make sure we 're hanging on , " @entity103 said
in regular conference calls with the @entity57 as recently as friday , the families have asked for the @entity5 military to conduct a dive
most recently , they have pressed @entity5 officials to ask the governor of @entity3 to fund a dive -- or at least to grant permission for the @entity5 families to carry out a private dive
the whereabouts of the sunken @entity7 are unknown , and the boat could be drifting somewhere on the sea bed , said @entity103 's daughter , @entity137 , a 34 - year - old preschool teacher
the boat capsized 60 miles south of @entity139 , @entity9 , about two miles offshore , during the first night of the trip
a @entity57 official said the @entity5 @entity142 does n't have the capability or equipment to do a deepwater dive and search for the fishing boat -- and it would have to pay for a private contract to do so
the official asked not to be identified , saying he was n't authorized to speak to the media on the matter
the details of the @entity58 's and @entity59 's joining the @entity9 investigation into the @entity7 are being worked out , the official told @entity1 tuesday
" when they were on the call , " the official said about the families , " we expressed condolences for the loss of life
unfortunately , the @entity142 has limited capability to operate at that depth " beneath the sea in a dive and search
" when a @entity5 citizen goes missing in a foreign country , the host government takes the lead in search and recovery efforts , often with the help of @entity5 government agencies , such as the @entity58 , who have the necessary experience and mandate , " the official said
" the @entity57 will monitor such efforts and work to ensure that the host government does its utmost to locate the missing person , but lacks the capacity and authority to conduct search and rescue operations
" but the families are n't satisfied
" it feels as though the @entity9 navy is not really sharing with them what is happening , " @entity182 told @entity1
the six other missing men are @entity187 of @entity188 , @entity3 ; @entity189 of @entity190 , @entity191 ; @entity192 of @entity193 , @entity3 ; @entity194 of @entity195 , @entity3 ; @entity196 of @entity197 , @entity3 ; and @entity198 , 62 , a retired @entity199 manager , of @entity193
@entity198 was also @entity200 's brother - in - law , said @entity201 , who works in the city hall of @entity203 , @entity3 , overseeing a first - time homebuyer program and housing ordinances
families have received messages on their @entity209 page that local @entity9 have taken the initiative to search coastal islands for the missing seven @entity5 , posting reports on which islands they 've searched
" this grassroot effort is someone knows someone knows someone , " said @entity182
she said the families are distressed to learn of what they describe as safety shortcomings aboard the @entity7
" had we known there were all these problems in @entity9 , we would n't have sent my father on this trip
we felt blindsided to some degree , " @entity182 said
" what we 're really trying to achieve here is to honor my father and all of the men that deserve to come back to their families , " @entity182 said
the families want the @entity7 found -- to see what safety problems the vessel may have had , relatives said
" we most certainly do n't want to harm the economy in @entity9 , but at the same time , we want assurance from @entity9 that if something is going to happen , that they 're going to be responsible for whatever that may be , " @entity182 said
" if there is an investigation that 's going to take place , we would hope that the @entity9 government would do a thorough investigation , and that would include a dive
