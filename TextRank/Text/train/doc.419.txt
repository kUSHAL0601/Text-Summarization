-- the @entity2 government has admitted it has 153 people , including children , in custody at sea while it fights a @entity8 challenge to any plans to send them back to @entity10
until tuesday 's court hearing in @entity13 , the government had refused to confirm or deny it was holding the suspected asylum seekers , in line with its policy of not commenting on operational matters under " @entity18
" all those on board are thought to be tamils who left the @entity23 port of @entity24 on a 72 - foot boat in mid-june
they include three - year - old @entity27 , whose image was released by a worried relative who has n't heard from his family for more than a week
" i am desperate to know where my family is
i ca n't function at all not knowing
i know all of them would be in very big trouble if sent back to @entity10 , " he said , via an interpreter to the @entity36 in @entity2 , before tuesday 's hearing
the government launched @entity18 last september , a military - led campaign to " stop the boats , " referring to a steady stream of vessels crammed with asylum seekers trying to make it to @entity2 waters
critics , including human rights campaigners , have slammed the policy , which advocates " turn - backs " and the offshore processing of asylum claims , as cruel and unnecessary
' culture of secrecy ' on tuesday , they also took aim at the " culture of secrecy , " which created days of uncertainty for family members whose relatives were presumably lost at sea , and resulted in a vacuum of official information to back up claims that a boat had gone missing
" it took getting a case to the @entity8 before the government would admit that they did have those people in custody and that they were on the high seas , that 's not good enough , " said @entity65 , from the @entity66
@entity74 , executive director of the @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , said the government 's silence raised " profound concerns " about whether their rights and @entity2 's obligations under international law were being breached
" our system of constitutional democracy is meant to deal with such grave matters with checks and balances under rule of law , not under a government - imposed shroud of secrecy with sweeping assertions that our international obligations are being met when the circumstances strongly suggest they are , in fact , being breached , " he told @entity0
@entity98 senator @entity97 said : " the ugly truth is that the government has been keeping dozens of children detained out on the high seas
these families have been at sea for over three weeks ; they are anxious and frightened
" the government has shown total contempt for the truth and for the rights of the @entity2 people to know what is being done in their name
thankfully the courts have been able to shed some light on this immoral behavior , " she added
why was the matter before the @entity8 ? on tuesday , lawyers acting for 50 passengers on board the boat -- including 21 women and eight children from as young as two years old -- were seeking to extend a 24 - hour injunction granted monday to stop the @entity2 government from handing them over to @entity10 authorities
fears they would be returned to face potential persecution intensified earlier monday when the government confirmed it had on sunday returned 41 @entity10 nationals found aboard a boat west of the @entity130 in late june
according to a statement from @entity2 immigration minister @entity133 , 38 @entity131 and four tamil @entity10 had been subject to an " enhanced screening process " at sea
it found only one @entity131 @entity10 had a possible case for refugee status , but that person had asked to return with the others , the statement said
human rights advocates said evaluating asylum seekers at sea was not an appropriate way to deal with serious claims
" it sounds as though three or four or five questions are being asked by video conference , snap judgments are being ( made ) , and they 're simply being returned , " said @entity146 , president of the @entity147
" there is an obligation with international law to have a proper process , " she added
in a statement , the @entity156 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity156 ) said , " @entity156 's experience over the years with shipboard processing has generally not been positive
such an would rarely afford an appropriate venue for a fair procedure
" on tuesday , the returned @entity10 faced court in the city of @entity164 , charged with illegally departing the country
what does the government say ? the government has repeatedly defended @entity18 as the only way to put people smugglers out of business and to prevent lives being lost at sea
in a radio interview last week , immigration minister @entity133 said : " i know there 's a lot of people out there who feel uncomfortable about elements of this , i get that ... but this is how you stop the boats
this is how it has to be done because this is what works
this is why we 're sticking to it
" ministers often refer to the 1,200 people thought to have been lost at sea while trying to make the dangerous journey through seas to @entity2 during the previous @entity200 government 's tenure
the @entity202 government boasts that not one person has drowned in the 202 days since the last successful people smuggling venture arrived in @entity2
in a statement on tuesday , acting immigration minister @entity205 said : " the government provided the @entity8 with the information it requested
however , in accordance with the policy established by the @entity212 , the government will not provide commentary about on - water matters under @entity18
" " the government will act in accordance with undertakings made before the @entity8 , " she added
@entity8 ruling on tuesday , the government agreed to give 72 hours ' written notice before any move to hand the asylum seekers back to @entity10
lawyers for the government revealed for the first time that the boat had been intercepted in @entity2 's contiguous zone , the area stretching beyond its territorial waters
because the boat was not in @entity2 waters , the people on board were not able to seek protection under the country 's @entity237 , the court heard
however , the presiding judge , justice @entity239 , said there was no barrier to the government moving the asylum seekers to another location for processing , presumably one of its two controversial offshore processing centers on @entity247 in @entity248 or @entity249
how did advocates know about the boat ? until tuesday , most of the details known about the boat and those on board came from the vessel itself
on thursday , someone claiming to be a passenger called a well - known human rights advocate
" we 're on our way to @entity2 , " the caller said , according to @entity263 from the @entity2 @entity264 , which represents the country 's @entity266 community
the caller said the boat had left the @entity23 port of @entity24 , with 153 people on board , all @entity266 , including women and children
other phone calls were made before communication with the boat suddenly ceased on saturday morning , @entity263 said , who passed the information to local media who called the @entity284 ( @entity284 )
asked how he thought the asylum seekers might be feeling about being held , @entity263 said : " the only thing i can think of is they 'd be very happy
why not ? not all of them know the government policy ( of offshore processing ) , some of them might
" but , at the end of the day , they would think ' if we prove we are real refugees then the government will take us
' that 's the mindset everyone has , is n't it ? " the @entity2 government has been returning asylum seekers to @entity10 , a country @entity2 prime minister @entity302 has said is " at peace " , despite reports of the abuse and mistreatment of @entity266 since the end of the civil war in 2009
