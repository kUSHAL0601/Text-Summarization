it 's easy to forget that some of the world 's biggest corporations were not always that big
many started small , with just one visionary person fueled by one innovative idea -- often working out of a garage , a shed or a backroom basement
@entity10 began as an online bookstore run out of founder @entity13 ' garage , before growing into the world 's largest online retailer
and technology - giant @entity16 started with @entity17 and @entity18 selling computers out of the same improbable abode
the humble beginnings of @entity10 , @entity16 , and countless other companies in developed but also developing countries show that one visionary person fueled by one great idea can be a game - changer
when fighting climate change , that same spirit of entrepreneurship is vital
governments have set a goal of limiting average global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees @entity32
achieving this requires a move towards climate neutrality in the second half of the century
innovation , entrepreneurship and vision are critically important elements to meeting this goal
the good news is that there are thousands of examples of entrepreneurs around the world who are finding a constantly expanding market for their solutions -- they are part of the @entity53 secretariat 's @entity55 initiative
meet the solar queen of @entity57 take @entity58 in @entity59
she began her career by connecting rural villages with solar power
@entity58 built a modest manufacturer of photovoltaic solar panels into a multi-million dollar industry , leading to the company 's public offering and her early retirement in 2007
she spotted an opportunity and seized upon it
observing regulatory changes in @entity59 's energy market , she visited the local authority to obtain more permits to build solar farms
the clerk she spoke to said : " please take more since no one else wants them
" this fed @entity58 's vision of sunny northeast @entity59 as a global leader in large - scale solar energy
she leveraged funding from the @entity84 toward her vision , building @entity59 's largest solar power generation company
today , the @entity87 drives growth in the photovoltaic market across @entity57
in doing so , we inspire others to take similar entrepreneurial action
@entity58 's business is just one of 12 innovative climate solutions that the @entity53 secretariat will showcase at the upcoming round of climate talks beginning this week in @entity100 , @entity101
in numbers action on climate change has reached a tipping point
this past september , 400,000 people participated in the largest ever global protest calling for action on climate change
a few weeks ago , in an unprecedented series of announcements , 21 countries pledged a total of up to $ 9.6 billion to enable the world to move to a low - emission , climate - resilient future
earlier , the @entity116 and @entity117 likewise announced a historic agreement to reduce their emissions
the @entity121 committed to ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % by 2030
over the next 15 years some $ 90 trillion will be invested in infrastructure globally -- greening this will require big , medium - sized , and small entrepreneurial companies
all great endeavors have humble beginnings
somewhere in the world , there is an entrepreneur in a garage or a duka designing the next game - changing climate solution that offers yet another catalyst towards a healthier , greener and more secure world
watch : the $ 50 million business built on hot air insight : @entity143 's chief 's big idea -- humans on @entity146
