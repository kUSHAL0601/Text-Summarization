last november , avid biker @entity0 found himself pushing harder than usual to keep up with a new friend
the two were locked in a fierce month - long competition to bike at least 1,000 miles
they rode at the same time , trading small talk and stats after each ride , and urged each other on
@entity0 said that because of the close competition , he doubled the number of miles he would normally have biked in a month
the biking , sweat and pain were all real
but the race itself was virtual
the conversations were on @entity21 , the rides tracked by an @entity18 app. the friend , someone @entity0 had never met , lives halfway around the world in @entity23
welcome to the new world of fitness - tracking technology
the tech has taken off over the past few years , led by small wearable pedometers like the @entity28 and @entity29 , and apps that use the gps and accelerometers in smartphones , like @entity34 and @entity35
on their own , these tools can be helpful for anyone trying to get into shape
they collect all manner of data , tracking workouts so people can set goals and self - monitor their progress along the way
that 's an important factor in changing any behavior , according to sports psychologists
but newer social features are turning the gadgets into even more powerful motivation tools
people are connecting with friends on the apps and embracing official and unofficial ways of swapping encouraging messages and trash talk , comparing workout stats , and using peer pressure and the need for approval to push each other to work out more and meet their goals
people who have friends on @entity34 , even just one , are two to three times more active than people who use the app solo , according to ceo @entity72
@entity28 says its users who use the social features on @entity28 also tend to be more active
working out for approval what is it about friends that makes us work out a little harder ? when deciding how to add social features , many of the app and device makers were influenced by the research of @entity87 professor @entity86 , who studies behavioral motivation
@entity86 said social features on fitness devices play three roles : they motivate people ; the various interactions act as triggers for action ; and sharing information and tips can increase ability
almost all fitness tracking tools now let you share your workout through the apps or on social media sites so people can see that you just finished a workout
some even let them track you during the workout or , for example , a big race
you 've probably noticed some of these in your @entity21 or @entity112 feed
they might seem like a brag at first ( even if they did trigger you to do some cardio )
but publicly sharing workouts has real benefits , especially for people who are just getting into shape and are trying to stick to new behaviors
" people tend to continue exercise if they feel it 's approved by other people who are meaningful to them , " said sports psychologist @entity121
even light positive feedback can be a motivator , such as a simple " like " on @entity112 , " cheer " on @entity28 or a " @entity132 " vote on @entity34 , which is the app 's equivalent of a like
the @entity34 app has a leaderboard that lets you compare your activity levels over the past month to your friends who also use the app. if one of your less motivated friends has been inactive for over 30 days , a shaming couch icon appears to the left of their name and a megaphone button to the right
the megaphone lets you send a message to your less - active friend telling them to go for a walk , run or bike ride -- but you can only bully them once ever seven days
@entity28 also has a leaderboard but does n't currently allow messaging through the mobile apps , though you can tweet out your progress
on the @entity28 website , friends can communicate with short messages or send each other a " cheer " or " @entity162
" " they tend to send more cheers than they do taunts , so it does tilt towards positive encouragement , " said @entity163 a senior product manager at @entity28
" at the same time we have some very interesting trash talk , more so on the playful side
" ' there 's no gunshot start ' built - in social features are still in their infancy for many trackers , but the people using them are finding creative ways to communicate with friends
knowing that people are rooting for him keeps @entity183 running
he 'll post details about a run on @entity112 and @entity21
and he 'll share it live as on the @entity34 app , where his friends can see stats like a map of the route he ran and his pace
he pops in his headphones and turns on the accessibility option in his iphone so that any supportive texts and tweets he gets are read aloud while he 's running
@entity199 posts screenshots of graphs showing his cycling , running and walking activities to @entity204 , as well as photos from workouts
sharing small victories and receiving virtual pats on the back on social networks was especially welcome when @entity211 first started doing training runs for a marathon in 2010 -- losing 60 pounds in the process
" without a social fitness - tracking website like @entity34 , no one would usually take notice of that run , " he said
" there 's no gunshot start , no water stops , no cheering crowds , and no finish line , unless it 's your own driveway
" @entity227 sometimes checks encouraging messages on her phone while she 's doing long - distance running , which she says keep her motivated -- " especially when things get rough
" she started running as a challenge to herself to get in shape for a 5k and , nine months later , she completed her first marathon
she tracked her running stats and posted them to her public blog as well as social media
people using mobile apps that do n't have options for messaging , like @entity28 , will take screenshots of their leaderboard and share with the friends they 're competing with on @entity21 or over text message
in many of these cases it 's for bragging rights and a bit of light smack talk
" support in the form of a challenge always motivates me more than a typical ' @entity257 ' or ' you killed that @entity261 , ' " said cyclist @entity259 , who recently completed his first triathlon
not just about motivation even when they 're trading insults , friends can provide valuable information on how to improve techniques and workouts
people who live in the same area can see the best biking or jogging routes suggested by other people
fitness tracking tools that let you connect with strangers are a good way to pair up with people who are at a similar fitness level
" one way that people gain self - confidence is when they see other people of similar ability doing things , " said @entity121
" it helps people improve adherence to exercise
" in addition to messaging and @entity21 , many people on these networks are trading tips and giving each other guidance on message boards
" @entity297 is n't just about motivation , " said @entity86
" as important is helping people learn ' how to ' and increasing their ability
