@entity0 -- @entity2 may be drawing to a close but for the eurozone 's economy , spring has only just begun
after 18 months in recession , the single currency bloc finally posted some much needed growth in the form of a 0.3 % expansion of gross domestic product for the second quarter
watch more : @entity14 's new challenges @entity15 was quick to take the credit , claiming its policies of structural reforms had finally started to take hold , whilst the investor community cautioned more work would be needed to ensure the nascent recovery could be sustained
the truth is that yes , things are looking up but it depends where you are in @entity14 and there 's certainly little room for complacency
predictably , growth in the eurozone 's two biggest economies , @entity33 and @entity34 , underpinned the region 's revival
but a closer look at individual countries further down the pecking order throws up some unexpected surprises , which i 've outlined below
read more : can @entity14 drive a new industrial revolution ? @entity43 , a nation whose profligacy and lack of competitiveness led to it being bailed out , grew 1.1 % while the @entity49 , famous for its fiscal prudence , shrank 0.2 % -- its fourth straight quarter of contraction
the economies of @entity55 and @entity56 remained stuck in reverse gear as well
so much for the stereotypes and the hard and fast crisis response rules which have taken endless @entity61 summits to draft
reading the data one would be forgiven for thinking three years of austerity never happened
in fact it was n't even mentioned once in @entity67 's own communique
watch more : why @entity14 's problems will come back and yet the challenge for @entity14 's leaders at a time when some of them are coming up for re-election will be to seize upon the green shoots without dropping the ball on spending cuts
in @entity33 , which will face a general election next month , business groups are already lobbying any incoming government to boost investment spending
and in @entity34 , large firms are still loath to hire due to the government 's lack of fiscal clarity and president @entity87 's new punitive tax regime
a ceo of one @entity90 business with over 60,000 staff across the @entity61 told me @entity14 was in recovery , and that presented opportunities -- but confidence was needed to ensure the upswing really took hold

indeed , the next challenge for @entity14 's top brass will be to convince companies the future is bright enough to start hiring again
across the eurozone and the broader @entity61 as a whole , firms have been amassing huge cash reserves which , in the face of uncertainty , have been neither spent on new machinery nor on the hiring of new staff
such businesses will need more evidence of a true lift than a mere quarter of expansion before they are to undertake any hefty capital expenditure
the eurozone crisis has dominated the political and economic sphere for more than three years
during that time millions have lost their jobs creating a legacy of high unemployment and long - term underemployment which will take years to tackle
with more than a quarter of their populations out of work today , countries like @entity56 and @entity134 will probably still finding solutions to their jobs crisis by the time the next recession rolls around
explore : how the crisis made the rich richer and the poor poorer that 's not counting a whole generation who missed its first step on the job ladder
if @entity14 really has learned its lesson , business and government should start setting the wheels in motion now to work together and retrain staff for the jobs available today and tomorrow
more jobs would boost domestic consumption and help provide a counterweight to export - dependency of the growth generators like @entity33
but to hire , businesses need to be offered incentives
one incentive is a stable , more robust economy
another is a benign interest rate environment , which is why what would really give this recovery legs is a rate cut by the end of this year
