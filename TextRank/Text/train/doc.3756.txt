-- with sparkling new air hubs and new tourism opportunities , some of the world 's biggest hotel brands have spied the perfect opportunity to pitch up in the @entity7 in recent years
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are all making major investments in previously sleepy outposts such as @entity13 as well as hot new locations like @entity15 , both in the @entity16
but one local company has a head start on the big global players coming late to the game
@entity21 is an @entity22 - based chain that has been growing at an aggressive rate since it was founded by business partners @entity25 and @entity26 in 1993
from just two hotels back then , @entity21 is now responsible for 85 sites across the @entity7 and northern @entity29
according to new ceo @entity35 , beating the international competition to the likes of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 is just the start of the company 's plans
the ambition is to more than double the number of cities where @entity21 has a presence to 40 and increase the number of hotel rooms -- or keys -- to 28,000 by 2018
the majority of this early expansion will take place in the @entity7 but @entity35 is also casting his eyes further afield
" we are talking to people in @entity53 , @entity54 ( and ) @entity55 , " he told @entity0 's @entity50 of where he hopes @entity21 will develop next
having been in the hotel industry for almost 30 years , @entity35 believes that @entity21 should be competing with some of the larger hotel chains in big important regional locations
" i visited several major cities in need of hotels
( they 'll say ) ' who are @entity21 ? ' that 's when we need to sell ourselves
" " when they ( potential investors ) come and see us , the quality , the portfolio ... the five stars and ( the ) apartments , they believe us
there will be an investor that will give the new kid on the block a chance
" a home - grown brand @entity21 's home grown brand status in the @entity7 gives it the ability to break ground where others may hesitate
it was the first to open a five - star - hotel in fast - growing @entity80 , northern @entity33
@entity81 on the list according to @entity35 is @entity83
with roughly 80 million consumers , the @entity84 is a big prize
" @entity83 is a big market ... we want to be the first ( there ) and i think we will be
some elements need to be stabilized but we are hoping by end of next year , early 2016 , we 'll see our first hotel
" to expand as planned , @entity35 says it is important to always maintain a clear identity and remember where the brand was born
the @entity21 in @entity22 , for example , was the chain 's first property and it remains a reference point for the company and the @entity16
" we 're not going to change how we 've been doing business just because i 'm the new ceo , " @entity35 said
" our model works and we want to keep it that way
in the next six months , one year , we will start enhancing , tweaking
" with the @entity7 , and in particular the likes of @entity108 and @entity22 fast becoming aviation hubs , opportunities to grow and further develop the regions burgeoning hotel sector will be plentiful
" i always talk about the airlines , " @entity35 said
" it 's happening , making our area explode ( with ) incomings and outgoings
" " it 's getting better moving forward ... bringing in commerce
that did n't happen 20 years ago and is great for us here and when we move out ( around the world ) , " he added
see who else has been on @entity124
