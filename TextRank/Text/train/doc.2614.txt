-- " @entity6 " returns this week with not a single original judge at the table , new possible contestants and some changes to the format
have we lost you already ? there was a time when a new season of " idol " would send fans into a frenzy , especially with the addition of new judges
this season will see the return of former judge @entity19 , along with last season 's judge @entity20 and newcomer @entity23 original judge @entity22 will this season serve as a mentor
the show will be back with heavy competition from @entity29 's " @entity28 , " which for the first time last year beat " idol " in the ratings on a thursday night
but even while the show , which for years has been a juggernaut in the ratings for @entity36 , has slid in terms of viewers for the past year , it is still a force to be reckoned with in tv land
" i do n't think ' @entity28 ' is more popular than our show , " " idol " producer @entity41 reportedly said at the recent @entity44 winter press tour
" if you look at the ratings , ' @entity6 ' still beat it
but having said that , ' @entity6 ' is the gold standard
it is the original format
" @entity41 added that she thought there was room for both shows
in addition to the reboot of judges , the show has also made some other tweeks , the @entity55 quotes @entity41 as saying
" we made a lot of small changes , " she said
" we did n't want to do anything radical
we went back and examined every single element of the show , from the talent search to the finale
... it 's still ' @entity6
' it 's a million tiny decisions that i think has made for a fresher whole
" some are looking to new kid on the block , @entity23 , to help revitalize the show
the singer told @entity79 news that he will be honest , but kind
" i watched the show when they were calling people names and making fun of them , " @entity23 said
" i do n't do that
" the reality singing competition has suffered from quite a few complaints from the poor performance of the male contestants last year to the lack of producing chart - topping artists in recent years
according to a @entity95 ranking , @entity93 was the top money - making " idol " winner last year
the country artist / " @entity98 " actress raked in $ 31 million last year and has pulled in $ 83 million over the past few years
@entity99 was second on the list , with earnings of $ 7 million
season 13 of " @entity6 " returns wednesday night on @entity36 .
