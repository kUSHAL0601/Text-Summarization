-- a rare working model of the @entity2 1 , the tech giant 's first desktop computer , sold for more than $ 671,000 over the weekend at an auction in @entity6
the computer , along with a letter from @entity2 co-founder @entity9 to its original owner , is believed to be one of only six working @entity2 1s and one of only three on the open market
the buyer , who chose to remain anonymous , is from the @entity17 , according to @entity18 of @entity19 , which auctioned off a roster of vintage tech saturday in @entity22
the @entity23 was expected to bring at least $ 400,000
but @entity18 said it 's no surprise that it fetched more than 50 % more
in november , his team auctioned a similar model for $ 640,000
@entity28 's @entity27 sold one last year for $ 375,000
prices for the rare devices have gone up since @entity9 ' death in 2011
in november 2010 , @entity32 's auctioned an @entity2 1 for $ 212,000
" it 's not only the technology of the world 's first ready - to - use @entity36 , " @entity18 said in an e-mail to @entity0
" it 's more the symbol of the @entity40 -- the story of two dropouts who had a superb idea ... and 35 years later their company is the richest and highest - valued company ever
" @entity9 and @entity46 famously created the @entity2 computer in @entity9 ' family garage , building the device by hand and financing the company through the sale of @entity46 's fancy calculator and @entity9 ' @entity55 camper van
about 200 @entity2 1s were built , and fewer than 50 are believed to exist still -- most of them not in working order
saturday 's lot also included the letter from @entity9 to a @entity61 at @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64
dated january 18 , 1978 , the letter offers @entity61 the chance to trade in his @entity2 1 , and $ 400 , for an @entity2 ii. he obviously did not take @entity9 up on the offer .
