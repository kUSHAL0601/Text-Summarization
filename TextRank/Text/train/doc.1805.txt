months after accepting asylum in @entity3 , fugitive @entity1 intelligence leaker @entity0 on thursday asked @entity3 president @entity4 about @entity6 's own surveillance practices
" does @entity3 intercept , store or analyze in any way the communications of millions of individuals ? " @entity0 asked in @entity12 via a video link during @entity4 's annual question - and - answer program , which was broadcast on state television
" and do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify placing societies , rather than their subjects , under surveillance ? " @entity4 responded that @entity3 has a special service that bugs telephone conversations and internet communications to fight crimes , including terrorism , but only with court permission and only " for specific citizens
" " so , the mass character is something we do not have and can not have , " @entity4 said in @entity3
" on such a mass scale ... we do not allow ourselves to do this , and we will never allow this
we do not have the money or the means to do that , " he said
@entity4 , a former intelligence agent , noted that his questioner , a former @entity41 contractor , shares that background
" so , we can speak in professional language , " he said
@entity0 last year disclosed details of the vast @entity1 surveillance network put in place after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , including the government 's record keeping on billions of phone calls
anticipating legal consequences , he fled to @entity6
@entity1 authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property
last month , lt. gen. @entity56 , the head of the @entity57 , told @entity58 that @entity1 officials must plan for the possibility that @entity3 has access to @entity1 battle plans and other secrets
" if i 'm concerned about anything , i 'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked , and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries -- in this case , of course , @entity3 , " @entity56 said
he cited intelligence capabilities , operational capabilities , technology and weapons systems as potential subjects that @entity0 -- and now @entity3 -- may have
" we have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised , " @entity56 said
last october , @entity85 visited @entity6 , where he told reporters that his 30 - year - old son told him he had had no contact with @entity3 security or intelligence
in january , director of national intelligence @entity91 told the @entity93 that the @entity0 leaks caused serious damage to @entity1 security
" what @entity0 has stolen and exposed has gone way , way beyond his professed concerns with so - called domestic surveillance programs , " @entity91 said then
" as a result , we 've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources , including some shared with us by valued partners
" the nation 's adversaries were " going to school on @entity1 intelligence sources ' methods and trade craft , and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much , much harder , " he told the committee .
