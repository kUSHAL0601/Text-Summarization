the @entity1 army declared martial law throughout the country tuesday in a surprise move that an aide to the embattled prime minister said the government did n't know about beforehand
" they took this action unilaterally
the government is having a special meeting regarding this
we have to watch and see if the army chief honors his declaration of impartiality , " the aide said , describing the situation as " half a coup d'etat
" lt. gen. @entity20 told @entity21 the move was not a coup
" the @entity27 aims to maintain peace , order and public safety for all groups and all parties , " a ticker running on the army 's television channel said
" people are urged not to panic , and can carry on their business as usual
declaring martial law is not a coup d'etat
" martial law went into effect at 3 a.m. on tuesday , the ticker said
all @entity1 tv stations are being guarded by the military , @entity1 public television announced , showing pictures of soldiers and armored vehicles taking positions outside broadcast facilities in the country 's capital
in a statement read on @entity1 television , the military declared that all of the country 's radio and television stations must suspend their normal programs " when it is needed
" the dramatic announcements come days after the head of the army issued a stern warning after political violence had surged in the country 's capital
political tensions have been running high in @entity1
supporters and opponents of the country 's government have staged mass protests in recent days , and earlier this month a top court removed caretaker prime minister @entity71 from office , along with nine cabinet ministers
it 's too soon to tell whether the military 's declaration of martial law will ease tensions or heighten them , analysts said
@entity80 , a political science professor , described the situation as " very volatile
" " this is a precarious time now for the army , " he said
" they have to be even - handed
" if the military appears to be favoring one side , he said , violence could escalate rather than cool down
" if it 's seen as favoring one side or the other side , then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military , " he said
@entity96 , director at @entity98 - based risk assessment firm @entity97 , described the situation as " martial law light
" " right now the military has deployed troops around key intersections of the city
traffic is a real mess here at the moment , but there 's no violence , " he said
" i think what the military is trying to do with this ... is to convince protesters to go home
they 're trying to dial down the tensions here as well as preempt several large rallies and strikes that were scheduled for later this week
" but what happens next will depend on how protesters react , he said
" the military is taking a step by step , gentle approach to see if they can get things to improve , " @entity96 said
" if not , they 'll of course have to ratchet up their actions
" @entity20 said the precise restrictions of martial law were being worked out
the government 's " red shirt " support base , many of whom hail from the country 's rural north and northeast , view @entity71 's ouster as a " judicial coup " and have been protesting what they consider an unfair bias by many of the country 's institutions against their side
anti-government protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections , which the opposition @entity153 has boycotted , arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held
increased government efforts to improve security are a positive step , @entity96 said
" that being said , martial law will not solve the political problems that continue to haunt this country , " he said
" the differences are stark , and i do n't think the military can step in and by force fix the political issues
