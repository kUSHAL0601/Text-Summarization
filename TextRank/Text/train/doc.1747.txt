-- with four different drivers winning each of the four races so far , 2012 is shaping up as one of the most open seasons in @entity6 history
and with no clear favorite yet to emerge , @entity8 driver @entity7 says his team is in a strong position to finally end a long title wait
the @entity14 marque has won only one race since returning to the elite division of motorsport in 2010 after an absence of half a century away , but @entity7 has hopes of emulating the 1954 - 55 world championship successes of legendary racer @entity21
the 26 - year - old 's win at the @entity24 @entity23 last month was @entity8 ' first since @entity21 's victory in @entity26 in 1955 , and his first in 111 career starts
" before @entity24 we were really struggling in races and we worked hard and improved the car , modified the set up quite a lot with the car , " @entity7 told @entity0 ahead of this weekend 's @entity31
" we 're not the best yet , which is what we want to be soon , but we 're getting there and we were the best in @entity24
" it 's a difficult season also , everybody is a little bit up and down this year
in the championship i 'm in a really good position
we really need to focus and improve the car step by step and try and get the most out of it and try and get ahead of the others
" the most open @entity6 season came in 1982 when at least 11 different drivers stood on top of the podium
but even then , @entity52 of @entity53 won the first two races
@entity7 believes @entity8 is in a strong position to overcome the disappointments of the past two seasons
" the team is just doing a much better job , they 're working together better
there 's even more competence now in the team
new people have joined and we 're getting there and we 're really growing quickly , " he said
" it 's taken longer for us and been more difficult than expected
but now we 're really on a roll and going in the right direction , and for everybody @entity24 was a very emotional moment
" @entity7 's veteran teammate @entity72 has blamed @entity6 's sole tire supplier @entity74 for the unpredictable results in 2012 , but the younger @entity14 is keen to see the positives in an open season and said the difficult conditions at last month 's @entity79 were a great learning experience
the hot @entity82 country took its toll on tires , with @entity85 's former world champion @entity84 suffering a puncture and retiring on the penultimate lap. his teammate @entity88 finished eighth , losing his championship lead to @entity91 's @entity90
@entity7 finished fifth after failing to repeat his @entity24 pace , and 43 - year - old @entity72 was 10th after fighting his way up from the bottom of the grid
" @entity96 was probably the toughest conditions tire-wise we 've had until now and there we were beating teams like @entity85 , who until then had been dominating the season , " @entity7 said
@entity8 , meanwhile , has downplayed reports it could be set to quit @entity6
@entity104 newspaper @entity103 claimed the @entity104 - based team could be forced out over a power dispute arising from @entity6 's proposed stock exchange flotation
it said @entity8 would miss out on a boardroom place despite its large investment as an engine manufacturer in the past two decades , while rival teams @entity91 , @entity112 and @entity85 would all be given representation by @entity6 chief @entity114
however a @entity8 spokesman told @entity0 : " we are in discussions with the commercial rights holder and we would like to ask for your understanding that we are not currently commenting on these discussions
