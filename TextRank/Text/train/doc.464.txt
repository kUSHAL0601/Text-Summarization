@entity0 -- an inquest jury considering the death of @entity4 , whose shooting by police sparked widespread riots in @entity8 two years ago , said wednesday he was lawfully killed
the 29 - year - old father of four was shot by police officers who stopped the taxi in which he was traveling in the northern @entity0 neighborhood of @entity13 in august 2011
his death sparked protests that exploded into riots and looting in @entity0 and spread to other cities in the worst disturbances in the country in decades
the jury at the @entity22 in @entity0 concluded that the killing was lawful in an 8 - to - 2 decision , even though @entity25 did not have a gun in his hand at the moment he was shot
they also said it was more likely than not that just before he was killed , @entity25 had thrown a gun from the taxi onto a grassy area near the scene
there were emotional outbursts at the court when the conclusion was reached , @entity36 's @entity35 reported
it quoted @entity25 's brother @entity42 as saying : " we still fight for justice
" the inquest began in september , and the jurors had been told to decide whether @entity25 was either shot lawfully or unlawfully , or return an open verdict
" no officer sets out at the start of the day to run an operation that results in someone dying , " assistant police commissioner @entity48 said outside the court
" so our sympathy today is with @entity4 's family
they have lost a loved one
but the task our officers face in making split - second decisions when confronting armed criminals means there is a risk -- a very small risk -- that this will happen
