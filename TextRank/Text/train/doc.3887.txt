-- @entity2 manager @entity1 is under increasing pressure following his side 's third consecutive @entity5 defeat
@entity1 , who has been forced to defend his side 's wretched run of form , was left facing criticism once again after @entity11 inflicted a 2 - 1 defeat on the @entity2
@entity2 , who also had @entity14 and @entity15 dismissed , fell behind to a @entity17 goal just before the interval
@entity19 fired home an equalizer from 25 - yards before both @entity14 and @entity22 were dismissed
@entity23 converted a penalty to earn @entity11 their first league win of the season and leave @entity1 fearing for his job
@entity2 has won just one league game so far this season following defeats against @entity31 and @entity32
it was a bad day for @entity2 's city rivals @entity33 after it slumped to an embarrassing 2 - 0 defeat against @entity35 at the @entity36
@entity35 , who arrived in @entity2 bottom of the table , took a 73rd minute lead through @entity41 before @entity42 sealed the win
@entity32 dropped their first points of the season after being held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity47 at the @entity48
@entity49 put @entity47 ahead from the penalty spot before @entity51 also netted from 12 - yards to secure a point
@entity53 suffered defeat in his first game as manager of @entity57 after @entity31 recorded a 1 - 0 win
the former @entity33 boss was unable to inspire @entity57 to its first victory of the season as @entity63 's goal gave @entity31 all three points
the game between @entity66 and @entity67 was called off after the president of the @entity70 club rejected local authority orders to exclude fans from their new stadium
in the day 's late game , @entity74 surrendered its unbeaten league record after suffering a 1 - 0 home defeat against @entity78 .
