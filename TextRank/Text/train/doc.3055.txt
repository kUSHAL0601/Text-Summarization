@entity2 -- " @entity4 " actress @entity0 defended her refusal to show her @entity6 to @entity2 police before they handcuffed her last week
the @entity10 - @entity9 actress and her white boyfriend accused police of racism for questioning them in what they said was only a public display of affection
" i believe in @entity9 and what it stands for , " @entity0 said monday in an interview on @entity3 's " @entity18
" police responded to a citizen complaint that " a male white and female black were involved in a sexual act inside a @entity27 " outside the gate of @entity29 on thursday , according to a spokeswoman for the @entity24
legal experts said the officer had the right to request identification if he suspected illegal behavior , but audio of part of the encounter with police , published by @entity39 , revealed that @entity0 did not believe so
" somebody called , which gives me the right to be here , " the unidentified @entity2 police officer is heard saying to @entity0
" so it gives me the right to identify you by law
" " do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black ? " she responded
" who brought up the race card ? " the officer said
" i 'm bringing it up because i have every right to be here , " @entity0 said
when the officer again asked for her @entity6 , the actress responded , " you can take me down to the court office , and i can make a scene about it
and you know what ? i have a publicist , and i work as an actor in this studio
" the officer , who patrols a neighborhood home to many @entity72 celebs , including @entity73 and @entity74 , seemed unmoved by the prospect
" i 'm mildly interested you have a publicist , but i 'm going to get your @entity6 , " he told her
" no , i 'm going to say no , and if you 'd like my @entity6 you can say that i 'm resisting arrest , " she said
" there 's no resisting , you 're just interfering , " he said
" i have probable cause ; we received a radio call
" @entity0 called her father
" i ca n't make out with my boyfriend in front of my f -- king studio ? " she is heard yelling to her father
" i do n't have to give him my @entity6 because it 's my right to sit on the f -- king street corner and make out with my boyfriend
" " keep yelling , it really helps , " the officer then said
@entity0 was eventually handcuffed and placed in a patrol car
she was released a few minutes later when her boyfriend relented and gave the officer her @entity6
a @entity2 police representative told @entity3 on sunday that officers from its @entity105 precinct were responding to a citizen complaint
" there was an indication on the radio call that a male white and female black were involved in a sexual act inside a @entity27 with the vehicle door open , " officer @entity107 said
" two people were briefly detained , but it was revealed no crime had been committed
" @entity118 ' boyfriend -- @entity119 , better known as celebrity chef @entity120 -- wrote in a @entity121 post that police " saw a tatted @entity124 white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a ho ( prostitute ) & a trick ( client )
" the couple posted a short video clip and several photos showing @entity118 in handcuffs talking to police
one image shows a cut on her wrist , which she said was caused by the tight handcuffs
@entity0 , who acts in the fx show " partners , " said the officers " accosted me and forced me into handcuffs " after she refused " to agree that i had done something wrong by showing affection , fully clothed , in a public place
" @entity119 said when an officer asked for their identifications , he showed his that but @entity0 refused " to give it because they had no right to do so
" " so they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was , " he wrote
" in the process of handcuffing her , they cut her wrist , which was truly not cool ! ! ! " she was released " quite quickly when they realized we were right outside @entity166 and that she was a celebrity and i was a celeb chef , " @entity119 wrote
" before they figured out who she was they were threatening calling an ambulance and drugging her for being psychologically unstable , so not cool whatsoever ! " @entity0 and @entity119 said they initially decided to forget about the incident , but then they decided they needed to speak up
" we still forgive , love and bless them ... just not putting up with this for our own freedom and heart space , " @entity119 wrote
the couple has contacted lawyers , the @entity185 and the @entity186 , he said
" our publicist has us in contact with media about it , too , and we 're supposed to hear back
" the @entity24 confirmed it is conducting an internal investigation
@entity0 , a native of @entity192 , made her feature film debut in 2012 as @entity195 in the @entity196 - nominated " @entity4
" @entity105 couple stopped by police , say they were racially profiled
