-- this week , @entity1 opened recreational marijuana stores for the first time
and these stores do n't just carry your father 's kind of weed
in addition to highly potent cigarettes -- which are much stronger than those some people might remember from @entity14 -- stores will also soon sell super-strength , pot - infused cookies , candies , sodas , vapor and wax concentrates
@entity20 will tell what the effects will be , but the state is not the first place to implement such a policy
@entity26 started to sell marijuana six months ago
when president @entity29 stopped by a @entity31 bar on tuesday night , it comes as no surprise that someone offered him weed
@entity26 's experience with pot legalization can hardly be called a success
in fact , it should be considered a warning for the residents of @entity1
special - interest " @entity42 " - like groups and businesses have ensured that marijuana is widely promoted , advertised and commercialized in @entity26
as a result , calls to poison centers have skyrocketed , incidents involving kids going to school with marijuana candy and vaporizers seem more common , and explosions involving butane hash oil extraction have risen
employers are reporting more workplace incidents involving marijuana use , and deaths have been attributed to ingesting marijuana cookies and food items
so much for the old notion that " pot does n't kill
" marijuana companies , like their predecessors in the tobacco industry , are determined to keep lining their pockets
indeed , legalization has come down to one thing : money
and it 's not money for the government -- @entity26 has only raised a third of the amount of tax revenue they have projected -- it 's money for this new industry and its shareholders
open @entity26 newspapers and magazines on any given day and you will find pages of marijuana advertisements , coupons and cartoons promoting greater and greater highs
the marijuana industry is making attractive a wide selection of marijuana - related products such as candies , sodas , ice cream and cartoon - themed paraphernalia and vaporizers , which are undoubtedly appealing to children and teens
as @entity103 , medical director of the @entity104 recently said , " we 're seeing hallucinations , they become sick to their stomachs , they throw up , they become dizzy and very anxious
" @entity103 reported that in 2013 , there were 126 calls concerning adverse reactions to marijuana
from january to april this year , the center receive 65 calls
and , since @entity26 expanded marijuana stores for medical users , peer - reviewed research has found a major upsurge in stoned driving - related deaths ( that is not surprising since marijuana intoxication doubles the risk of a car crash )
it is little wonder that every major public health association , including the @entity125 , the @entity126 and the @entity127 oppose the legalization of marijuana
the scientific verdict is that marijuana can be addictive and dangerous
despite denials by special interest groups and marijuana businesses , the drug 's addictiveness is not debatable : 1 in 6 kids who ever try marijuana will become addicted to the drug , according to the @entity140
many baby boomers have a hard time understanding this simply because today 's marijuana can be so much stronger than the marijuana of the past
in fact , more than 450,000 incidents of emergency room admissions related to marijuana occur every year , and heavy marijuana use in adolescence is connected to an 8 - point reduction of iq later in life , irrespective of alcohol use
as if our national mental illness crisis needed more fuel , marijuana users also have a six times higher risk of schizophrenia and are significantly more likely to development other psychotic illnesses
it is no wonder that health groups such as the @entity167 of @entity168 are increasingly concerned about marijuana use and legalization
that does not mean we need to arrest our way out of a marijuana problem
we should reform criminal justice practices and emphasize prevention , early intervention and treatment when necessary
but we do not need to legalize -- and thus commercialize and advertise -- marijuana to implement these reforms
the only people better off under legalization are the big companies that stand to profit from sales of marijuana
and we can be sure they will get even richer while public health and safety suffers
@entity189 legalizes medical marijuana ' i like weed , and i 'm a good person ' : pot smokers fight stereotypes
