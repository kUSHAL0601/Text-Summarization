in a half hour special program , @entity26 travels to @entity28 to meet @entity29 , an @entity31 dealer , who is acting on behalf of the owners of " @entity9 , " and gets to see the painting first hand
during his time in @entity28 , @entity26 also talks with restorer @entity35 , who brought the painting back to its original state
intrigued , @entity26 heads to @entity39 to learn a little more about the life and work of @entity4 , the ultimate renaissance man
further interviews with world renowned @entity4 experts shed more light on the man , his paintings and his contributions to science and medicine
finally , @entity26 returns to the @entity19 where the " @entity9 " will be on show to the public until february 2012
