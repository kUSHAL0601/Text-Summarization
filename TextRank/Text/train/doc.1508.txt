-- a protester in military fatigues and an old steel army helmet barks out orders to a line of @entity7 police officers -- yes , police officers
" forward , march ! " shouts the protester
and the officers move , to the delight of cheering protesters
" good work ! good work ! " the crowd screams as the officers move toward @entity16 's @entity15
the officers -- about 30 in number -- are defectors mostly from the town of @entity20 in western @entity7 , where most look toward @entity21 in a divided nation that has long split allegiance between @entity21 and @entity24
their commander , @entity25 , decided to lead them to @entity16 after seeing the images of bloodied protesters , some killed -- opposition officials say -- at the hands of security forces
" we want to make a statement that we can not tolerate this any longer , " he said
" we are from western @entity7 , and we want to show everyone that the police is with the people
" the question of whether some police officers were defecting amid the violence took center stage on thursday , when the government said protesters had taken several dozen police officers hostage
however , other officers appeared on @entity7 television saying they had defected after receiving orders to use force on protesters
it 's unclear what might happen to the men
an agreement signed friday by government and opposition leaders requires protesters and security forces alike to withdraw from the streets and turn in illegal weapons
it appears to protect protesters from prosecution for illegal weapons possession during the protest
but it does n't address the case of police officers who walked away from their jobs to join and help defend protesters against their comrades
although things are peaceful today , the men are well aware that they might have to confront their colleagues on the other side of the barricades if the situation escalates again
" some police officers have committed crimes , " @entity25 said
" by shooting at unarmed people and medical volunteers
