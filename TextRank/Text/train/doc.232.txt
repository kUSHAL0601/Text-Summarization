-- @entity2 offices in at least three states have reported instances of vandalism that party members say possibly were tied to sunday 's historic vote on health care reform
early monday morning , a glass panel at the @entity12 office of @entity14 rep. @entity13 , @entity15 , was shattered , spokesman @entity9 said
it was n't clear how the window was shattered , but visitors have to go through a gated courtyard to enter the office , and staffers suspect someone may have shot a pellet gun at the glass , he said
nothing was taken from the congresswoman 's office , @entity9 said
staffers had stayed late at the office the night before because of the health care vote , but had left before the incident , he added
the office has never experience anything like it since @entity13 ' staff occupied the office in january 2007 , @entity9 said , adding that staffers believe the incident was linked to the health care vote in @entity39
in upstate @entity41 , two similar incidents were reported before sunday night 's vote , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity43
a brick was thrown through the window of the @entity47 headquarters in @entity48 , and another was tossed through a window of @entity2 rep. @entity51 's office in @entity52 early friday
@entity43 reported that a note attached to the brick in the @entity55 office read " extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice " -- a quote delivered in an acceptance speech by @entity63 president candidate @entity62 at the 1964 @entity63 convention
no one was injured in either incident in @entity41
@entity51 told @entity43 that her offices have recently received threatening phone calls
speaking on the @entity70 floor sunday , @entity51 referred to damage at her office , saying , " the anger is n't just contained outside the @entity73
last week someone hurled a brick through the window of my district office in the dark of night
we must step back to remind ourselves of why we are here
" the @entity70 on sunday passed the sweeping $ 875 billion health care reform bill in a 219 - 212 vote
all 178 republicans opposed it , along with 34 @entity2
both @entity13 and @entity51 supported the measure , though authorities investigating the incidents have not officially confirmed the link to the health care vote
another incident was reported earlier in the weekend by the @entity90 in @entity91
party executive director @entity92 told @entity0 that a brick with @entity94 and anti-health care messages was thrown at the headquarters sometime late friday or early saturday
nothing was taken , and no one was injured , she said , adding that a bakery next door called police
@entity92 mentioned that a recent post on a blog encouraged people to throw bricks at local @entity2 offices nationwide
the @entity108 - based blog , called " @entity109 , " says it has launched a " window war " against @entity2 and has kept a tally of the recent incidents of damage , including the ones in @entity41 and @entity91
blogger @entity115 of @entity117 , @entity108 , told @entity0 monday that in a friday blog -- which he says was posted after the incident at @entity51 's office -- he called for people to break windows at @entity2 headquarters at the city and county level
he said he did n't call for the damages to congressional offices because , " i did n't want to be responsible for anybody breaking a federal law
" however , " i can understand how someone can be frustrated enough to throw a brick through a congresswoman 's window , " @entity115 said
he said he feels the health care bill is " unconstitutional and tyrannical
" " my answer is violence , by getting their attention , " he said , adding , " if we can get across to the other side , that they are within inches of provoking a civil war in this country , then that 's a good thing
