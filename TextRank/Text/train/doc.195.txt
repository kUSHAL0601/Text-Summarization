@entity0 -- to the pile of accusations against the @entity4 , now add one of the first opinions by a nonpartisan official that the agency went outside the law
that conclusion on tuesday from the official responsible for managing historically important @entity14 records came at a congressional hearing during which @entity16 also tried to widen the spotlight of @entity4 scandal to include the @entity19
@entity20 , who heads the @entity21 , told a @entity19 panel that the @entity4 " did not follow the law " when it failed to tell his agency about the loss of emails belonging to former @entity4 official @entity27
the @entity27 emails are of particularly high - interest because she was the most senior manager so far connected to @entity4 targeting of tea party and other political groups
@entity27 retired last year and has refused to testify before @entity33 , exercising her constitutional right not to do so
the @entity19 has charged her with contempt as a result and her lack of testimony has frustrated @entity16 investigators
over a week ago , the @entity4 revealed that @entity27 's hard drive crashed in 2011 , destroying thousands of emails and documents
the agency insists it has retrieved some 24,000 of the missing emails by checking the accounts of other @entity4 employees who corresponded with @entity27
@entity16 have pounced on the technical aspects of the crash as well as on whether the @entity4 followed federal records keeping law by not having a better backup system to retain electronic information
those laws also require agencies to notify the archives of any loss of official records
tuesday 's hearing before the @entity59 followed a contentious session on monday night during which the panel grilled agency commissioner @entity62
in questioning before the panel on tuesday , @entity20 told lawmakers that @entity27 's emails were certainly federal records -- either temporary or permanent
and he said the @entity4 has yet to report the loss of the hard drive and the emails to his agency
" did they break the law ? " rep. @entity73 , a @entity74 @entity16 , asked
" i 'm not a lawyer , " @entity20 answered
" can we safely assume they broke the law ? " @entity73 followed
" they did not follow the law , " @entity20 concluded
@entity19 official testifies the @entity4 has maintained that it did not realize the full extent of the hard drive crash until late april or early may
@entity62 testified the @entity4 waited to tell @entity33 because it was trying to retrieve and reconstruct what information it could at first
the same hearing included testimony from @entity19 attorney @entity87 , who worked at the @entity4 from may to november of 2013
@entity59 chairman @entity88 subpoenaed @entity87 after the @entity19 initially said that she left the @entity4 before the agency knew about the hard drive crash and could not offer any meaningful testimony
she agreed to appear following the subpoena
that set up immediate tension , as the @entity95 @entity16 opened his questioning by accusing @entity87 of being a hostile witness , demanding quick yes or no answers
" i 'm definitely not hostile , " she answered in an almost gentle voice , stressing that she was eager to cooperate and ultimately sparking @entity88 to say the term " hostile " was not accurate
as the @entity19 foretold , she shed no light on the @entity27 hard drive crash
but @entity87 did give one of the most detailed public descriptions yet of how the @entity4 initially responded to the congressional investigations into the tea party targeting
tedious process she laid out a tedious five - step process to find and collect tens of thousands of emails , for which the agency was unprepared at first
" the @entity4 ' material is protected with careful encryption , " @entity87 said
" so it needs to be processed before it can be reviewed
they have to load it and flatten it and then decrypt it
... then , they would run the ( search ) terms that the congressional committees had identified over the material and once that was done and the material was viewable , they would move it over into a review tool
" @entity87 said that then acting @entity4 commissioner @entity125 was emphatic in directing that the agency turn over documents as fully and quickly as possible in response to congressional requests
but when she arrived , @entity87 saw an @entity4 that did not have the resources in place for such an operation
" we ( needed ) to add people because the @entity4 had never encountered anything like this , " @entity87 told the panel
" we did n't have the staff in place to do this kind of document review production
" she added that the agency also had to add significant server capacity to handle the requests
" i think the record of the @entity4 reflects very very hard work to produce the documents , " @entity87 concluded
@entity4 blasted over lost hard drive , but no apology from agency chief key questions about the controversy
