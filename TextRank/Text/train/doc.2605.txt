-- a @entity2 judge set bail at $ 15,000 wednesday for a man who wrote a controversial book considered a " how - to " guide for pedophiles
@entity8 , who was arrested in @entity9 on monday , said the book , " @entity11 to love and pleasure : a @entity16 's @entity15 , " can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles
and , instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest , it teaches them to avoid illegal actions , he said
@entity8 has been charged with the distribution of obscene material depicting minors engaged in harmful conduct , @entity2 authorities said
he made his first appearance in a @entity2 courtroom wednesday afternoon
his court appearance came a day after he held court in front of reporters explaining the nature of his book
asked if he is a pedophile , @entity8 said , " i only have sex with grown - ups
" he said he has no children and " i do n't keep children around my house
" @entity41 , @entity2 , sheriff @entity42 has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation , buying the book through the mail
greaves protested tuesday saying he is the target of entrapment , but @entity42 disagreed
" he wrote this book , he published this book , he put it on @entity60 to sell , " @entity42 told reporters as @entity8 was being booked into the @entity53 , " and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it
" @entity8 and his book gained national attention earlier this year after @entity60 defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people
the book was removed from the website in early november
officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children , grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents
@entity42 said @entity49 ' book outlines a " code of ethics " that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children
@entity8 told reporters tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood
he said he was introduced to sex at the age of 7 by a 10 - year - old friend and began having sex with other children
this continued , he said , until he was about 15 , when he stopped and did not have sex again for years
" once i got into adolescence , i suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile , " he said
but now , he said , he is an example of the fact that people can reform
" i think all speech should be protected , " @entity8 said
but " i was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to @entity2
i think @entity2 law is for @entity104 and @entity9 law is for @entity106
" he told reporters he will not be able to make bond : " i 'm actually quite poor
" judge @entity109 said wednesday in court that if @entity8 does not post bail he must remain in @entity2 , can not have contact with anyone younger than 18 and can not have access to a computer
@entity0 legal analyst @entity116 said on @entity0 's " @entity117 " monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting @entity8 , and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional
" i do n't think they can go forward because the book is clearly protected by the @entity123 , " @entity116 said
" this book , as awful as it is , it is only words
" @entity42 vehemently disagreed with @entity116 's assessment of the case and the two sparred on the program
" this has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity , " @entity42 said
" we had a law in @entity2 that applied
