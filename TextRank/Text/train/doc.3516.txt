-- comedian @entity1 knows a universal truth : women love a man in uniform
sadly , he just ca n't fit into his anymore
" i ca n't snap my dress white bottoms anymore -- i think i put them on for some girl a few years ago
" but these days , the former @entity11 lieutenant can barely even get his pants all the way up
" how does your thigh grow bigger as you get older ? " however , those pants used to fit a really funny sailor who never took things too seriously
" i got lowered off of a helicopter onto the ship , and i 'm cracking jokes , " he recalls
" and they 're like , ' this is not funny
' and i 'm like , ' look at me ! i 'm @entity26 ! ' " it 's been years since @entity1 served , but what used to get him in trouble in the @entity11 now fuels his comedy
and while some fans may be familiar with his stand - up routine and the show " @entity1 " on @entity38 's @entity37 , most people know him from his past role as the " drunken red - headed guy " on the @entity44 comedy " @entity45
" this summer , @entity1 will re-team with his " @entity45 " co-star @entity46 for an original series with @entity48 called " @entity49 with @entity1 and @entity46 , " where they 'll tour some of @entity52 's best baseball stadiums
he also just completed filming for the feature film , " @entity53
" @entity1 sat down with @entity0 for a video interview in @entity55 to discuss life in the @entity11 , which , apparently , can be a little dirty
