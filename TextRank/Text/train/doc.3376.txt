-- @entity2 president @entity1 tried to distance the school from the sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the campus as he spoke to angry alumni thursday night
" it grieves me very much when i hear people say ' the @entity2 scandal
' this is not @entity2
this is the ( @entity13 ) @entity12 scandal , " @entity1 said
the town hall meeting in a hotel in suburban @entity16 comes the same day @entity2 revealed it is paying long - time coach @entity17 as if he retired at the end of the season , even though the university relieved him of his coaching duties on november 9
during the meeting , most of the questions revolved around the firing of @entity17
crowds booed @entity1 several times
in a statement earlier thursday , the chairman and vice chairman of the board of trustees said @entity17 was removed as head football coach because he " could not be expected to continue to effectively perform his duties " amid sexual abuse allegations involving @entity12 , a former defensive coordinator
" coach @entity17 remains employed by the university as a tenured faculty member , " said the statement by board chairman @entity35 and vice chairman @entity36
" the details of his retirement are being worked out and will be made public when they are finalized
generally speaking , the university intends to honor the terms of his employment contract and is treating him financially as if he had retired at the end of the 2011 football season
" some university students , former players for the @entity49 and others were angered by the removal of @entity17 , the 85 - year - old coaching great who guided the team for 46 years and recorded the most wins in college football history
after @entity17 's dismissal was announced in november , student protesters overturned a news van and vandalized streets around the campus before police dispersed them
@entity2 was rocked by accusations that @entity12 had sexually abused young boys over 14 years and that school officials failed to take the complaints to police
@entity2 trustees dismissed @entity17 and school president @entity70 after a grand jury report accused @entity12 of more than 50 counts of sexually abusing boys
@entity12 has pleaded not guilty to the charges
a @entity2 graduate assistant , @entity74 , told the grand jury late last year that he had seen @entity12 " with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line
" he said he had gone to @entity17 with what he saw
@entity17 said he 'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report , but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss
after first saying he had done " what i was supposed to do , " @entity17 said that " with the benefit of hindsight , i wish i had done more
" it was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation
then - athletic director @entity91 and @entity92 , a former university vice president who oversaw campus police , now face charges of perjury and failing to report child sexual abuse
