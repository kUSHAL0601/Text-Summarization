-- military work is physically demanding — and we 're not just talking about soldiers on the battlefield
travel down the chain , and you 'll find plenty of positions where strength and stamina are highly valued skills
take the @entity13 for example
the @entity13 needs ships and those ships need to be built and maintained — a rough , physically draining job
sandblasting , riveting , and grinding excess metal off the ships can take a toll on the human body
you 're often carrying tools that can weigh upwards of 30 pounds
" there 's a lot of wear and tear on you , " says @entity24 , director of new initiatives for @entity26
" skilled workers can maybe do that for three to four minutes then they need to put the tool down and they need to rest
" photos of unexpected shooting targets used by the world 's armies for the past couple of years , @entity24 has been leading a team of engineers and designers to create one of the first industrial - use exoskeletons
called the @entity45 , the exoskeleton is able to support tools of up to 36 pounds and transfer that load from a worker 's hands and arms to the ground
the goal is to lighten workers ' loads , ultimately making them more productive and skilled at their jobs
the @entity13 recently bought two of the exoskeletons and plans to test them over the next six months to see how they might be used in an industrial situation
compared to something like the @entity61 ) , a computerized exoskeleton that essentially wants to turn mere mortals into @entity64 , the @entity45 is fairly simple
" i would call it elegant , " says @entity24
the anodized aluminum and carbon fiber skeleton weighs 30 pounds , and follows along the outside of a human 's body
it has joints in the parts of the body that would regularly have joints ( ankle , knee , hip ) and flexes from side to side at the waist
@entity24 says the skeleton was designed for complex environments — whoever is wearing it can climb stairs or a ladder , squat and generally move business as usual in the exoskeleton
tools mount to the front of the @entity45 and that weight is directed through the joints in the hip and down to the floor , relieving stress on the entire body , including the feet and ankles
people around the world pose with everything they eat in a day watch and learn the design team began by watching how humans walk
" you have to look at biomechanics of the person because it 's not just a stand ; it 's really something they can move around in , " says @entity24
the @entity45 was designed so it could slip over a worker 's boot — this is important since feet often communicate the first signs of weariness
it 's like running in a pair of crappy shoes ; it impacts your entire body
many exoskeletons transfer that weight to the sole of the foot , but this is a problem , says @entity24
" when the weight of the tools and exoskeleton itself is transferred to the ground , it comes to rest on the sole , " he says
" however , a sole can also contribute to user discomfort , increased metabolic cost to the user and introduces instability
" instead , the @entity45 uses a stirrup that attaches to the ankle , allowing the foot to rest on the ground as usual
why are we so fat ? the multimillion - dollar scientific quest to find out early tests show that the exoskeleton has increased productivity anywhere from two to 27 times , depending on the task
the team measured the amount of time a worker could hold a 16 - pound grinder overhead without having to rest his arms
" the longest operators could work continuously without a break was three minutes sustained without augmentation , " says @entity24
" using the @entity45 , operators could work 30 minutes or longer without requiring rest breaks
" @entity26 has been developing exoskeleton technology for the past five years
its other exoskeleton , the @entity158 , is hydraulic - powered and can support up to 200 pounds
the @entity158 was designed to be used on the field , during battle
the @entity45 ' capabilities are scaled down , but with its focus on mobility , you can imagine that it could be useful for other industries like construction or mining — " anywhere there 's a complex and irregular environment , " says @entity24
" we 're expecting other industries to see it and say , ' we want something similar
' " more from @entity0 : the mystery of go , the ancient game that computers still ca n't win i liked everything i saw on @entity178 for two days
