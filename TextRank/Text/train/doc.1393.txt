some members of the media were allowed to view the tape as well , but the judge did not want the reactions of reporters or the public to influence jurors , he said
the charges also related to another girl who @entity7 was accused of sexually assaulting on videotape
the tape was given to authorities in september 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before
on it , police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted
after attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl 's identity , authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl , and the case drew nationwide attention
she was found in october 2007
an attorney for her mother said she was 7 years old and safe and healthy
the rape occurred before the girl 's third birthday , while she was in the care of a baby - sitter her mother had hired , he said
the mother did not know the girl had been victimized
after the girl was found , authorities asked @entity0 and other news organizations to stop showing her picture
in an appearance on " the dr. @entity84 , " the girl 's mother said the girl has no recollection of the assault
@entity7 , a resident of @entity87 , @entity4 , was arrested in a traffic stop in october 2007
police said at the time they pulled @entity7 ' car over because it had no license plate , and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired @entity95 license with a photo that did not match his appearance
@entity7 eventually admitted who he was and that he was being sought , authorities said
the man who turned the tape over to authorities , @entity100 , faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over , during which authorities alleged he showed it to others
a judge gave @entity100 a one - year suspended sentence and three years of probation in april after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer , according to the @entity113
he initially had faced a felony count of possession of child pornography .
