-- authorities have found what they believe to be the remains of @entity4 , a 3 - year - old @entity5 girl whose neighbor told police he had suffocated the girl with a plastic bag and then tossed her from a highway
a @entity14 officer found the remains tuesday evening along a ditch northeast of @entity17 , @entity5 , about 8 to 10 miles from the girl 's home in @entity20 , said @entity12 prosecuting attorney @entity11 said
he said the remains are expected to be sent for forensic examination on wednesday

earlier tuesday , 43 - year - old @entity32 of @entity20 appeared in court
he has been charged with first - degree murder in connection with @entity4 's death
@entity4 was last seen on august 6 , riding her pink bicycle with her brother outside their home
@entity32 does not yet have an attorney
the august 30 court appearance will be a counsel status hearing , the prosecutor 's office said tuesday
according to a probable cause affidavit dated saturday , police interviewed @entity32 on friday at the police department in @entity49 , a larger community about 10 miles northeast of @entity20
the suspect said that he spotted the girl standing on a ladder by the pool in his backyard
he told police that he grabbed the girl and carried her inside his house
there , according to the affidavit , the man " suffocated the girl with a white plastic trash bag , by holding it over her face and mouth
" @entity32 states that he felt like it took an hour for the girl to die , " the document adds
