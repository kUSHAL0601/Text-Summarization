@entity0 -- the leader of @entity6 's extreme - right @entity5 , @entity7 , is being held in custody after appearing in court wednesday , the state - run @entity2 reported
@entity7 is being held at @entity11 until it 's decided which jail will house him , the agency reported
he gave a deposition to a @entity6 court on wednesday that lasted until the early hours of thursday morning in @entity0 , it said
he faces charges of running a criminal organization following the slaying of an anti-fascist musician last month
there was a heavy police presence outside the court in @entity0 ahead of @entity7 ' appearance
three other @entity5 lawmakers who have already appeared in court -- @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- were released wednesday pending trial
a fourth , @entity32 , remains in custody
the arrests of the lawmakers , along with those of a number of party supporters , were part of a weekend police crackdown that followed a controversial stabbing death
it is the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1974 , after a seven - year junta , that a party leader and members of @entity48 have been arrested
@entity49 , a popular anti-fascist figure and well - known hip - hop artist with the stage name @entity49 , was the victim of a knife attack that was allegedly committed by a @entity5 supporter
@entity27 denied his party 's involvement in @entity57 ' death , calling it a " heinous crime
" the singer 's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban @entity5 , which holds 18 of @entity48 's 300 seats
the @entity6 constitution does not allow for political parties to be banned , however , and the arrested lawmakers will retain their parliamentary seats unless they are convicted of a crime
in 2012 , @entity5 rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some @entity6 -- spurred by internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country 's deep financial crisis -- to win 7 % of the vote and gain seats in @entity48 for the first time
the ultranationalist , anti-immigration party has been linked by critics to street violence and neo-nazism
