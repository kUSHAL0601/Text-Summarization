the fallout from the @entity3 foundation 's decision not to renew funding for some @entity6 projects has led to threatened resignations , angry press statements and a letter from @entity10
now the mayor of @entity12 has gotten involved
@entity12 mayor @entity14 announced that he is giving a $ 250,000 matching gift to the @entity6 to help make up for the loss of funding announced tuesday by the @entity3 for the @entity18 , his office said thursday
" politics have no place in health care , " the mayor said in a statement
" breast cancer screening saves lives , and hundreds of thousands of women rely on @entity6 for access to care
we should be helping women access that care , not placing barriers in their way
" he was referring to @entity6 's announcement tuesday that the @entity3 had " succumbed to political pressure " by cutting its funding for breast cancer screenings at @entity6 amid increased scrutiny by @entity39 over how @entity6 provides abortion services
@entity14 's gift comes on top of the $ 400,000 that @entity6 reported raising online from 6,000 donors the first 24 hours after the announcement
@entity6 's loss attracted moral support when @entity47 , which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to @entity6 , announced thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the @entity3 to reverse its decision
" the move is clearly connected to attempts by @entity56 in @entity39 to defund @entity6 , " the organization said in a statement
" in responding to questions about its decision , the foundation cited as its rationale a sham ' investigation ' into @entity6 launched by @entity63 rep. @entity63 as one of the most militant anti-choice members of @entity39
" in september , the @entity66 , on which the @entity68 congressman sits , began an investigation into @entity6 over the organization 's " compliance with federal restrictions on funding abortions
" in @entity74 , at least 22 @entity10 signed a letter calling on @entity3 to reconsider its decision
" this troubling decision threatens to reduce access to necessary , life - saving services , " it said
" it would be tragic if any woman -- let alone thousands of women -- lost access to these potentially life - saving screenings because of a politically motivated attack
" " people respond powerfully when they see politics interfering with women 's health , " said @entity85 , spokeswoman for @entity6 , on wednesday
" that 's why we 've seen a tremendous outpouring of support
" but the @entity93 said in a statement that the @entity3 's decision was justified
" @entity6 is currently the focus of a congressional investigation , and multiple affiliates are under state investigations , " it said
" @entity6 operatives are lashing out at @entity3 across the @entity102 and throughout the media , in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint @entity3 's policy as cowardly and politically motivated
" the @entity3 denied thursday that its decision stemmed from politics
" we 've always had the right to cancel contracts for organizations that came under investigation for potential wrongdoing , " said @entity109 , ceo and founder of the group
in all , grants were not renewed to 16 of 19 @entity6 clinics , she said
" we do n't base our funding decisions on emotions or politics or whether one side or another will be pleased
" @entity109 was a political appointee of the @entity126 administration , in which she served as @entity128 ambassador to @entity129 and as chief of protocol
@entity3 was @entity109 's sister
@entity3 president @entity133 said the funds will be redirected " to other programs in our communities that can provide these services more directly
" she said there was " amazing consensus " among foundation board members about the decision , which was made " over the better part of two years
" but that consensus did not include dr. @entity144 , a member of the foundation 's medical advisory board in @entity12 , who said she will resign if the decision is not overturned
" i can not as a physician and advocate for women 's health continue to be a part of the organization if it continues in this direction , " @entity144 said
" a big part of what @entity3 does is reach underserved communities of women
with this decision , they 're not living up to this mission
" @entity162 , the group 's managing director of community health programs , left @entity3 this month
" it was an honor to oversee and expand their public health efforts during my six years there , " @entity162 said
" at the same time , i respect the work of @entity6 , including their lifesaving efforts to detect cancer in its earliest stages
the divide between these two very important organizations saddens me
" it was n't immediately clear whether she had resigned
@entity133 said it 's policy not to release information about employees other than start and end dates
@entity185 , executive director of @entity3 's @entity187 chapter , did resign , the foundation said thursday
but @entity3 denied that @entity189 's resignation was about the decision
" the @entity192 executive director @entity191 did submit her resignation in december 2011 , effective april 1 , 2012
her stated reasons did not include the recent grant making criteria changes by @entity3 's global organization that impact @entity6 , " said a statement from @entity195 , president of the @entity187 chapter
" we are deeply concerned by implications that there is any correlation
" @entity133 said @entity207 ' investigation " has little to do " with the grant decision
@entity109 said the " quality of the grants " was a factor
" we like to have direct care being given , " she said
" we have decided not to fund , wherever possible , pass - through grants
in other words , we were giving them money ; they were sending women for mammograms
they do not own mammography equipment
they do not do these grants within their clinics
they just send them out for screening and treatment and diagnosis
what we like to have are clinics that we can directly fund
" asked how many other grantees provide abortion services , she said , " that 's not something that we ask people about
" @entity109 said donations to @entity3 were up 100 % over the past two days
@entity6 said that funding from the @entity3 had largely paid for breast exams at local affiliates
in the past five years , grants from the group have supported 170,000 screenings , about 4 % of the total exams performed at @entity6 health centers nationwide , according to the group
in a statement thursday , the president of @entity6 , @entity248 , expressed gratitude for @entity252 's gift
" this contribution will help ensure that politics do n't interfere with women having access to health care , " she said
" people all across the country have stepped forward in the last 48 hours to offer help and support , and the mayor 's donation will help ensure that no woman is denied breast cancer services because of right - wing political pressure campaigns
" @entity252 , an independent who was first elected mayor as a @entity56 , is founder and majority owner of @entity252 , a multinational financial media company .
