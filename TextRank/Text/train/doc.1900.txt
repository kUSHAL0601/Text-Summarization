the bills officially come into circulation monday , although they were on the foreign currency dealers market saturday
as high as they are , though , the bills still are n't enough to buy a loaf of bread
they can buy only four oranges
the new note is equal to just one @entity19 dollar
once - prosperous @entity1 has seen an unprecedented economic meltdown since it gained independence in 1980 , with the official inflation rate now at 2.2 million percent
@entity23 , governor of the @entity24 , said the new notes are for " the convenience of the banking public and corporate sector " in light of price hikes
" the @entity24 has noted with concern the unjustifiable and incessant general increases in prices of goods and services
it is therefore appealing to the business community to follow ethical business practices as well as take an interest in the plight of the general public , " @entity23 said in a statement dated friday
@entity1 started issuing large bank notes in december , starting with denominations of $ 250,000
in january , the government issued bills in denominations of $ 1 million , $ 5 million , and $ 10 million -- and in may , it issued bills from $ 25 million and $ 50 million up to $ 25 billion and $ 50 billion
the new bills are actually bearer checks and have an expiration date of december 31
@entity1 has not had formal currency since the introduction of bearer checks as a temporary measure in 2003
" the @entity24 is fighting a losing battle , " economist @entity55 said in @entity0
" as long as the inflation remains high , cash shortages will persist
there is need to address the inflation by increasing production so that too goods do not [ cost ] a lot of money
