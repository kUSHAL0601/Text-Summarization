-- a tropical weather system has moved into the @entity2 from the @entity3 and is near the southeastern @entity4 , according to the @entity5
but the chance the system will become a tropical depression or storm is somewhat less than before
the center now says the system has a " medium " chance of developing into a depression or storm over the next two days
it puts the odds at 40 percent
it 's still causing drenching rain and gusty winds for several hundred miles to the east , affecting the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and the @entity24
the severe weather will probably spread over the @entity4 and @entity27 and @entity28 during the next couple of days , possibly causing life - threatening flash floods and mudslides in mountainous areas , the forecast said
and as the system moves generally westward , at 10 to 15 miles an hour , a big question is how it will affect efforts to contain the oil spill in the @entity37
@entity0 meteorologist @entity38 says forecast models show the tropical wave moving into the @entity4 and across southern @entity41 this weekend and then re-emerging in the northeastern @entity37
@entity43 and @entity44 officials are contemplating trying to permanently seal the crippled well by pumping mud into it through a technique called " static kill , " but the timing could be influenced by what the weather does
bad weather could send ships at the well site back to shore
it also could disrupt booms intended to keep the oil from reaching shore and send skimming ships that collect oil on the surface back to port
retired coast guard adm. @entity64 , who 's in charge of the @entity43 effort , says that if the system becomes a storm , containment and work on a relief well , considered the permanent solution , could be thrown off schedule anywhere from 10 to 14 days
meanwhile , @entity3 islands have been coping with a deluge of rain
@entity77 , a spokeswoman for @entity78 , said the weather forced some road closures
video from @entity0 's @entity83 affiliate in the @entity43 territory showed streets overwhelmed by rushing water and some giant sinkholes
