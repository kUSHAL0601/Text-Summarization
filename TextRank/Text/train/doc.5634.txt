@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 tv channels could advertise abortion services for the first time under new advertising rules proposed thursday by an ad industry group
the new proposals will also allow condoms to be advertised more widely on television
the @entity12 , the industry body responsible for writing and enforcing advertising rules in @entity4 , said the commercials would be for pregnancy advisory services that give information about a range of options to pregnant women , including abortion
if an organization does not offer information about abortion , it would have to make that clear in the ad , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity20 said
abortion clinics , which require referrals from doctors or hospitals , would not be allowed to advertise under the proposed rules , @entity20 said
there would be no restrictions on when such ads could air on @entity4 television , she said , but programmers would have to keep the sensitive topic in mind and not schedule the ads around religious programs , for example
" it 's a sensitive product , so it would have to be scheduled sensitively , " @entity20 told @entity2
the proposal is among a number of updates to current advertising standards that the @entity46 and @entity12 , its broadcasting arm , published thursday after an 18 - month review
" each year the @entity4 public ( sees ) millions of advertisements , many of which are memorable , " the committee said
" the advertising codes aim to make sure that they are memorable for the right reasons
" the public now has until june 19 to comment on the proposals before they come into force , likely in 2010 , the committee said
the new proposals also contain a change on advertising condoms on television
under current rules , condoms generally can not be advertised on tv before 9 p.m. in order to protect younger viewers , the committee said
new rules would relax the restrictions on advertising condoms , with the only requirement that they not be shown around programs intended for children younger than 10
the change came after @entity78 , a member of the @entity79 , requested the change and noted that @entity4 had the highest teenage pregnancy rate in @entity82 along with spiraling rates of sexually transmitted diseases , the committee said
@entity78 reported a survey that showed young people believed tv was one of the most effective ways of encouraging them to use condoms
" the presence of condom advertisements on television continues to be a subject of complaint to the ( @entity97 ) , but numbers are very low , " the committee said
" nevertheless , @entity12 has to balance public sensitivities against a public health problem that is clearly urgent
