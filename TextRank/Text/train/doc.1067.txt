@entity1 officials are scratching their heads over the decision by @entity4 to sue president @entity5 over his decision to delay a requirement in the health care law for businesses to provide coverage to employees
that 's because , as one senior administration official pointed out on friday , those same lawmakers voted to do the exact same thing at virtually the exact same time -- defer until 2015 the part of @entity17 known as the employer mandate
house speaker @entity19 justified last july 's vote , held days after the @entity5 administration action , as a repudiation of the executive decision to alter a major part of the politically - charged law just months before it was put into practice
" i get to look at the @entity27 once in a while
the @entity27 makes it clear that @entity29 writes the law , and the president takes the oath of office to faithfully discharge the laws that are on the books , " @entity19 said
the @entity1 voted separately to delay the @entity17 individual mandate as well , another centerpiece of the landmark 2010 law that remains in place and requires everyday @entity41 to have some kind of health insurance
both the business and individual mandates required compliance to avoid possible fines
the two @entity1 votes drew significant @entity50 support but the @entity50 - led @entity51 did n't take up either
obamacare fight continues the reference to last year 's vote by the @entity4 - led @entity1 signals @entity1 confidence that @entity19 's lawsuit announced on thursday night will fail in court
@entity1 @entity4 tried to use their constitutional powers to delay the mandate but failed , the @entity1 thinking goes
@entity19 consulted legal experts before announcing the action and @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity65 reported that they were advised that keeping the focus of any legal challenge narrow offered the best chance to succeed in court
the suit first must be authorized by legislation before being submitted in federal court by private attorneys
the timing of a court filing is unclear
@entity17 is the signature domestic policy achievement of @entity5 's presidency so far
it 's aimed at fulfilling his promise to make health care coverage available to millions without it
since october , the administration says 9 million people have signed up for a range of policies through federal and state insurance markets
but it has also been a bitter partisan flashpoint since its approval in 2010 without @entity4 support
@entity4 have made it a focus of their sharp political attacks on @entity5 and @entity50 ahead of november 's midterms with control of the @entity51 at stake
" in terms of politics , there is no issue that @entity4 have the best chance of riling up the base than @entity17 , " @entity63 said
the case also magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed @entity29 overall and come to define @entity5 's relations with @entity4 in general
some arch - conservatives in the party want him impeached
pushing forward @entity19 does n't agree with such a step , but he 's plowing ahead with an unusual legal challenge built around @entity4 claims @entity5 has abused his authority at the expense of the legislative process
@entity5 defiantly challenged @entity4 last week , saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional @entity4
" so sue me , " he dared them
@entity1 spokesman @entity115 quickly dismissed @entity19 's decision to take his case court as a " political stunt
" the president " is doing his job -- lawsuit or not -- and it 's time @entity4 in @entity29 did theirs , " @entity115 said in a statement
@entity19 argued the employer mandate delay is the best legal avenue for his case against @entity4 claims that @entity5 has overstepped his executive authority in carrying out his priorities
" in 2013 , the president changed the health care law without a vote of @entity29 , effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it , " @entity19 said in a statement thursday
" that 's not the way our system of government was designed to work
no president should have the power to make laws on his or her own , " @entity19 said
@entity1 @entity4 point to the support they received from constitutional scholars who testified on the @entity17 mandate delay last december
@entity5 overreach ? at a @entity156 hearing , @entity152 law professor @entity151 , a once fierce critic of the @entity154 administration , suggested @entity5 overreached
" the president is required to faithfully execute the laws
he 's not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same resources to them , " he said
" but i believe the president has crossed the constitutional line
" administration officials have repeatedly argued that alterations to the @entity17 are legal
in february 2013 , a @entity167 spokeswoman told @entity168 the administration has the power to delay the employer mandate and its fines , which are in essence taxes on businesses that do not comply with the law
the taxing authority of the federal government was the legal underpinning of the @entity180 's decision to uphold the sweeping health law and its individual mandate in 2012
but other legal experts have already said any lawsuit around executive authority would face challenges
in order for it to be formally considered by the courts , @entity187 must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution
