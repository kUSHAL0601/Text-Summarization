-- @entity1 and its photo - sharing subsidiary @entity2 announced new policies aimed at stemming online sales of illegal guns
the social media platforms have agreed to remove reported posts that evade gun laws , restrict minors under the age of 18 from viewing posts about firearm sales and provide education to better inform law - abiding sellers of guns
" by taking these unprecedented educational and enforcement efforts , we 've been able to strike an important balance in helping people express themselves , while promoting a safe and responsible community , " @entity16 , @entity1 's head of global policy management , said at a news conference
the new rules come after campaigns by gun safety organizations nationwide have pushed for stricter controls on the sale of firearms
@entity30 , an organization devoted to gun - control reforms , started on a @entity1 page in december 2012 , shortly after a gunman killed 20 first - graders and six staff members at @entity36 in @entity37
the organization lobbies for more restrictive gun policies that protect the safety of children and families
@entity30 founder @entity30 said more than 230,000 @entity43 signed the group 's petition , tweeted or used other social media to ask @entity1 and @entity2 to crack down on online sales
the organization last year campaigned for @entity49 to ban guns in stores , resulting in an open letter by ceo @entity53 telling customers to leave guns at home
@entity57 , the largest gun violence prevention group , which was founded by former mayors @entity59 of @entity61 and @entity62 of @entity63 , discussed the issue with @entity1 officials
" people are logging onto the @entity69 and signing into what has become , unfortunately , a virtual gun show , " @entity66 , chairman of @entity57 , said in a conference call wednesday
in november , @entity61 state attorney general @entity72 joined efforts to persuade @entity1 and @entity2 to issue new gun rules
" responsible social media sites know that it is in no one 's interest for their sites to become a 21st century black market in dangerous and illegal goods that place our families and communities at risk , " @entity72 said in a statement
@entity1 already prohibits ads for the sale of guns or ammunition , said @entity16 , adding that the new rules will strengthen that policy
neither @entity1 nor @entity2 are e-commerce sites , but both facilitate conversation and provide an open marketplace that makes it possible to exchange information promoting weapons sales
gun sales listed by site users talked about " no background check required " or said " will cross state lines , " @entity66 said
law enforcement officers and advocacy groups will have a direct connection to @entity1 to flag posts that may promote this illegal activity , officials said .
