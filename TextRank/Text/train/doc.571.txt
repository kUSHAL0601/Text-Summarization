@entity0 -- @entity5 is " one of the world 's most complicated humanitarian crises , " with 40 percent of the population relying on @entity0 aid for survival , the @entity0 's envoy to the troubled @entity4 nation told the @entity12 wednesday
@entity5 " challenges the rules of statehood , " @entity13 , @entity0 humanitarian and resident coordinator for @entity5 , said
the country 's central government is extremely weak and the drought - stricken nation is essentially lawless
what security does exist is provided by militias and rebel groups
and clashes between rebel groups and government forces have been especially fierce since 2009 , when the current moderate president came to power
@entity13 emphasized the importance of continued @entity0 funding to " sustain assistance to this most acute humanitarian crisis
" civilians " bear the main brunt of current conflict , " @entity13 reported to the @entity12
numbers tell a story of misery
some 1.2 million @entity5 have been forced from their home villages or regions
about 200,000 were forced from the capital of @entity42 this year alone
since march , the country has suffered 3,000 conflict - related casualties
one in five @entity5 children is undernourished
much of the country 's violence is fueled by the need for basic resources , @entity13 said
food riots have " been the pattern of what 's happened in @entity42 for the last 18 years , " he told the 15 - member @entity12
@entity13 was pressed by council members on recent allegations that aid to @entity5 has been siphoned off by @entity56 , an @entity57 - affiliated @entity5 group
@entity13 said that allegations of misuse were taken very seriously and officials are addressing the problem
@entity13 's findings were not totally negative
thanks to @entity0 aid , 1.3 million @entity5 now have access to clean water and vaccination campaigns are continuing even in areas occupied by insurgent groups , @entity13 said
@entity5 has been kept polio - free at a time when many other @entity4 nations are seeing a resurgence of the disease , @entity13 said .
