according to a recent book , there are 100 things to do in @entity3 before you die
we 've collected 12 of them here
all are located in @entity8 , unless noted
sing karaoke at @entity10 you ca n't play a guitar like @entity13 , you ca n't sing like @entity14 and yet you dream of being a rock star like @entity16
especially when you 've been drinking
sound familiar ? since 1996 , this former bodega has been one of the primo showcases for local bands in @entity3 , and on monday and friday nights , their famous karaoke band gives accountants , baristas and repressed librarians a taste of the limelight
even if you do n't have it in you to take the stage , the drinks are cheap and the people watching ranges from " wow " to " that 's hilarious " to " what a train wreck
" but no matter the level of talent , the entertainment factor goes to 11
@entity10 , 95 @entity38 ; +1 212 358 1633 walk the @entity39 considered this generation 's @entity41 , the 1.45 miles of reclaimed railroad track is testament to community activism and urban beautification efforts
initially slated for demolition in 1999 until downtowners @entity47 and @entity49 started @entity50 , the park now hosts more than 4.4 million visitors annually , which has actually become a problem
the path is only 30 feet wide in some places , causing a pleasant stroll to sometimes feel like waiting in line
so visit early in the morning or late in the evening , and avoid weekends at all cost
the @entity39 runs from @entity59 to @entity60 ; +1 212 500 6035 get a ticket at @entity62 ever wonder what pastrami is , exactly ? it 's beef brisket cured in brine and covered with a mix of spices that include garlic , paprika and mustard seed
then it 's steamed until the meat begins to break down
the process was a way of preserving meat before the age of refrigeration
today , there are only three @entity3 delis to get a traditional pastrami sandwich : @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity62
each of these granddaddies have their share of history and old - timey charm , but @entity88 's undoubtedly delivers the best experience
upon entering , you 're given a ticket ( which you better not lose ! ) , and then you proceed to the counter to order ( your ticket will get marked depending on what you order )
if you 're a traditionalist , you 'll want pastrami on rye with mustard and a cup of matzo ball soup
a mound of pickles is thrown in for free
after taking that last delicious bite , take a stroll around the place to look at all the photos on the wall , and see if you can find the table where that scene from " when @entity110 " was filmed
p.s. it 's open late ! @entity62 , 205 e. @entity112 ; +1 212 254 2246 watch some noir at @entity114 there are several good independent movie theaters in @entity3 , but the @entity117 stands alone as cinema 's obsessive historian
the atmosphere of the theater itself somehow matches the mood of the carefully curated celluloid that lights up the big screen nightly
international noir from @entity127 and classics by @entity129 are house specialties , but so are little known gems like " @entity132 " ( starring @entity133 ) and " @entity134 " ( which made @entity135 a star )
so the next time you 're wondering what to do on a friday night , take a chance and catch a movie you 've probably never heard of
@entity114 , 209 w. @entity112 ; +1 212 727 8110 shop at @entity143 at the corner of @entity145 and @entity146 , where a @entity148 mansion once stood , is the city 's temple to high fashion and conspicuous consumption
founded in 1899 by @entity154 , the department store carries all the usual -- @entity155 , @entity156 -- but it 's also known for identifying and selling the best from upstart designers from around the world
splurge on something , even if it 's only a glass of wine in @entity163
@entity143 , 754 fifth ave. ; +1 212 753 7300 cruise past the @entity165 all those poor , tired , huddled masses would have headed straight back to the @entity167 if they had to endure the lines that typically greet the patriots and tourists looking to visit @entity171
the best way to see @entity174 's first lady is to take the @entity176 cruise , which departs from @entity176 , down the @entity177
it passes this close by @entity165 before heading under the @entity181 and @entity8 bridges
( there are lots of @entity176 cruise options , so make sure you choose the right one
and a good alternative is a ride on the @entity189 , which gets pretty close to @entity165 , runs regularly and is free
) @entity176 , @entity176 , @entity190 ; +1 212 563 3200 rock out at the @entity191 ever hear of the @entity192 team ? how about @entity194 or @entity195 ? if not , then chances are you 're not cool
do n't worry , though ! a quick fix is only a gig away at this tiny concert venue where bands from all over the world come to jam
the bar upstairs is a great place to amp up with friends before heading downstairs to get electrified by music not meant to be consumed by mass - market audiences
obviously you should do some homework and see a band that interests you , but any night rocking out at the @entity191 will be a night to remember
@entity191 , 6 delancey st. +1 212 533 2111 explore the northwest area of @entity41 ask any @entity3 for a short list of must - sees in @entity41 and they 'll likely rattle off destinations like @entity217 and @entity218
but ask @entity41 's historian , @entity219 , for her favorite spot and she 'll send you up north to the now defunct bridle paths
the area has a distinct topography ( complete with waterfall ) , making it a favorite among naturalists and joggers alike
@entity41 ; +1 212 310 6600 visit the @entity229 considering the unspeakable depravity that led to the creation of " ground zero , " the feeling of reverence , endurance , perseverance and peace that now greets visitors is truly astounding
more than 11 million people have come here from all over the world since it opened in 2011 , and in so doing , paid tribute to the indomitable human spirit
the site is solemn , but it 's also a place of wonder and learning , with the considerable effort of those who designed and built the memorial evident at every turn
the two massive reflecting pools that cascade water down into the footprints of the two felled towers are equal parts moving and beautiful
bronze panels surrounding the pools bear the names of everyone who died in the attacks , and are arranged with delicate significance
the museum , located seven stories underground at the base of the original @entity265 , curates a powerful and extensive exhibit that includes crushed fire trucks , salvaged steel tridents that once held up the towers , photographs and biographies of all those who perished in the attacks , including those of the terrorists , lest the world forgets who was responsible
@entity229 , @entity278 ; +1 212 , 312 8800 listen to live jazz in @entity280 what , you think @entity282 is really dead ? there are three known cures for jazz know - nothings in @entity3 : @entity287 , the @entity288 and the @entity286
the latter two venues have been around for the better part of a century , but all three attract the very best talent and have atmospheres that make for one of those late nights to remember
go alone or with a pal , and hear firsthand the city 's one true soundtrack
@entity287 , 183 w. 10th st. ; +1 212 252 5091 @entity288 , 178 7th @entity299 ; +1 212 255 4037 @entity286 , 131 w. 3rd st. ; +1 212 475 8592 disappear inside the @entity300 @entity3 is lousy with esoteric museums -- what , you 've never heard of the @entity304 on east 84th street ? -- but it 's a different story inside the baroque colossus that occupies the east frontage of @entity41 between 82nd and 83rd streets
its famed treasures are too numerous to list here , but with an operating budget of more than $ 250 million a year , it 's the only museum in the world that rivals @entity315 ' louvre
properly exploring the museum in one day is impossible , but arrive early and consider opting for the amazingly insightful audio tour
do n't @entity318 these treasures : the musicians by @entity321 autumn rhythm by @entity323 marble statue of the emperor @entity325 the dining room of @entity328 the @entity330 room the @entity300 ; 1000 fifth ave. ; +1 212 535 7710 catch a @entity332 game if you 're not from @entity3 -- and even if you are -- there 's a good chance you 're not a fan of baseball 's greatest - ever team
nevertheless , a trip to @entity340 should come before a trip to @entity342 [ location of the @entity344 ] for any lover of @entity174 's national pastime
regular stadium seating tickets range from $ 100 all the way up to a ridiculous $ 200 , though the $ 78 for the bleacher is a good option if you do n't mind being cut off in the 5th inning ( concession stands everywhere else serve until the 7th inning ) and have a tolerance for vulgar chants
make sure you stay to the end to hear @entity359 's " @entity3 , " provided the home team wins ! @entity340 , 1 e. 161st st. , @entity361 ; +1 718 293 4300
