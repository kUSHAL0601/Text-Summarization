-- the @entity1 , a division within the @entity2 , was a troubled agency long before the oil spill in the @entity4 and the recent revelations of employee misconduct
the agency -- which oversees @entity8 offshore drilling , including the @entity4 -- has come under fire for mismanagement , questionable conduct and cozy relationships with industry officials
the @entity1 issued permits for the @entity16 drill rig -- contracted by @entity17 -- which exploded on april 20
the explosion killed 11 people and resulted in an oil spill that is threatening parts of the @entity4
@entity2 secretary @entity22 , during an appearance wednesday before the @entity24 , said he was trying to change the agency 's culture and its structure , which some critics say leads to mismanagement
" my belief is that most of the employees of the @entity1 are good public servants , " @entity22 said
he , however , acknowledged some of the past conduct was " scandalous " and " reprehensible
" @entity22 said some people have been fired and others referred for prosecution
two sources told @entity0 on thursday that @entity1 director @entity38 has been fired
at a @entity24 subcommittee hearing thursday , @entity22 insisted @entity38 had resigned " on her own terms and own volition
" president @entity43 later said he did n't know whether @entity38 was fired or resigned on her own
the @entity43 administration has said in recent weeks that many of the problems within the @entity1 were inherited from the @entity48 administration
@entity22 , during his testimony and in his answers to members of @entity53 on wednesday , also made that point
during the hearing , rep. @entity55 , @entity56 , asked @entity22 why he and other officials were " harping on what @entity1 did or did n't do in the previous administration
" " why are n't we talking about the here and now ? " @entity55 asked
@entity22 was blunt in his response
" we 've done a lot to clean the house at @entity1 , unlike the previous administration , " he said
" this is not the candy store of the oil and gas kingdom which you and others were a part of
" conflict of interest ? the @entity1 , which has about 1,700 employees , has two responsibilities when it comes to industries such as oil or natural gas
it must act as a regulator while also collecting royalties from the companies
some critics say those are opposite pulls and make the agency ripe for mismanagement
the @entity8 government technically owns resources such as the oil in the @entity4
companies pay the federal government for the rights to drill in certain areas
the @entity1 collects and distributes about $ 13 billion a year , @entity22 said
@entity91 of the @entity92 said there is a built - in conflict of interest , resulting in lax regulation of involved companies
" the @entity1 has a lot of incentive to collect as much , in the way of royalty income , as it can
that means pressure to authorize a lot of drilling and then to do everything possible [ to make sure ] that the flow of production is robust and unimpeded , " said @entity91 , who recently wrote a piece critical of the @entity1 for @entity104 magazine
" @entity1 , as it is currently structured , has to simultaneously put one foot down hard on the gas pedal and the other on the brake , " he said
" and the imperatives to go fast are a lot stronger than to slow down
" @entity22 said organizational change within the mms and a restructuring of the agency was necessary to deal with such conflicts
@entity22 advocated plans to " remove revenue collectors away from the leasing and policing functions of the @entity1
" he then wants to create two bureaus within the @entity1
one would be responsible for creating energy resources -- including oil and gas -- in the outer continental shelf
it would issue leases and collect royalties
the other would act as the policing arm of the agency , carrying out inspections and enforcing regulations
' misconduct , management and spills ' " @entity1 used to stand for @entity1
it now stands for misconduct , management and spills , " said rep. @entity143 , @entity144 , during the @entity24 hearing wednesday
a report released this week from the inspector general 's office at the @entity2 revealed federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the @entity4 accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored
the report said all the events detailed in it occurred before 2007
in one case , an inspector in the @entity1 office in @entity162 , @entity163 , conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company , the report said
others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil , with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in
the report also alleged employees at the same office received tickets to 2005 @entity180 football game from an offshore production company
the report also includes a confidential source informing investigators that a @entity1 inspector abused drugs , including crystal meth
in 2008 , during the waning months of the @entity48 administration , @entity189 , then the @entity2 's inspector general , issued a report condemning the behavior of some of the agency 's employees
" the single-most serious problem our investigations revealed is a pervasive culture of exclusivity , exempt from the rules that govern all other employees of the federal government , " the report said
the report said , between 2002 and 2006 , some of the staff received gifts from oil and gas companies with whom they were conducting business
some of the more salacious charges in the report included substance abuse and sexual relationships with industry contacts
' the revolving door ' meanwhile , sen. @entity216 , @entity217 , focused on the " revolving door " between industry and government
the " revolving door " refers to people who work in areas such as the oil industry , move to a government agency such as the mms and then return to the private sector
@entity216 proposed legislation that would have federal oil industry regulators wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate
among other things , the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies
it also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies , and prohibit them from part - time employment in the industry
it is time , @entity216 said wednesday on the @entity246 floor , to " stop this cozy , incestuous relationship between the oil industry and the regulators
" @entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity254 's @entity253 contributed to this report .
