@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 narrowly blocked @entity5 campaign finance disclosure legislation in the @entity3 tuesday after raising concerns the bill would curb freedom of speech and tilt campaign spending in favor of the @entity5
a 57 - 41 vote fell short of the 60 votes needed for the @entity3 to cut off debate on the measure
republicans unanimously opposed the measure while @entity5 solidly backed it
@entity5 said the legislation -- known as the @entity18 -- would bring greater transparency to campaign contributions from corporations , labor unions , and other special interests , which were able to ramp up political spending in the wake of the @entity27 's controversial ruling in @entity28 vs. @entity29 earlier this year
the bill would require organizations paying for political advertising to disclose the names of their top donors in the ads , similar to what now is required of political candidates for federal office
republicans accused @entity5 of trying to preserve their majorities in the @entity42 and @entity3 by skewing the rules in the favor of labor unions , trial lawyers , and other @entity5 - leaning groups
@entity5 denied that was their motive , and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying @entity2 critics
the @entity53 were not mollified
democrats " fear the righteous judgment of the @entity59 people in this coming election , " warned sen. @entity54 , @entity55 , who spearheads the @entity53 ' election effort
" so they 're trying to change the rules in the middle of the game to suppress the speech of those who might disagree " with them
senate minority leader @entity69 , @entity70 , slammed the bill as a " partisan effort , pure and simple
" " this bill is about protecting incumbent democrats from criticism ahead of this november 's election , " he said
it 's an " all - out assault on the @entity78
" @entity5 accused @entity2 of going back on their pledge to find a way to add transparency to political giving after the @entity28 ruling
they argued that without the new law , special interests will run roughshod over voters ' interests
" the @entity27 decision was a true step backwards for this democracy , " said sen. @entity88 , @entity89
" it allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited amounts of their money influencing our democracy and it opens the door wide for foreign corporations to spend their money on elections right here in the @entity59
" senate majority leader @entity106 , @entity107 , said the bill was " about trust and confidence in our democracy
" the measure " asks us to put the people before the special interests , " he argued
let in " the sunlight that disinfects our democracy
" sen. @entity117 , @entity118 , who often votes with @entity5 and who has worked on campaign finance legislation in the past , complained @entity5 were resorting to " ram and jam " legislating in which @entity2 are not invited to help craft bills and are forced to vote against measures they could have supported
" i know it 's good for politics to have a vote , but it is n't good for policy and getting it right , " she said
sen. @entity131 , @entity89 - @entity132 , promised that the @entity5 leadership will continue to seek ways to overturn or reduce the impact of the high court 's @entity28 ruling
" this is a sad day for our democracy , " he said
" this fight will continue
" @entity1 's @entity141 contributed to this report
