@entity0 , @entity1 -- four generals held without charges since 2005 in connection with the assassination of former @entity1 prime minister @entity7 were freed wednesday on orders from the @entity10 tribunal investigating the killing
the tribunal investigating the murder of former @entity1 prime minister @entity7 orders generals ' release
the four -- @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 -- had been arrested after a coalition led by @entity7 's son @entity20 swept to power in the wake of the assassination
they were met by well - wishers upon their release , with opposition lawmakers greeting @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity15
" this never happened since the @entity32 times , even during the @entity34 time , that people were just locked in jail for no reason and no charge , " @entity15 said after being met by top lawmakers from the opposition party @entity29
he called for supporters to remember them in parliamentary elections scheduled for june , and " let justice take over
" @entity15 was the director of @entity1 's internal security services at the time of the car bombing , which killed 22 others along with @entity7
@entity16 was the country 's domestic security chief ; @entity17 was the head of military intelligence and @entity18 was in charge of president @entity53 's security force
the @entity10 tribunal convened to investigate @entity7 's february 2005 death ordered the men released earlier wednesday , declaring the evidence against them was " not sufficiently credible to request the maintenance in detention of those persons
" @entity7 was credited with rebuilding @entity0 after the country 's 15 - year civil war ended in 1990
many @entity1 blamed @entity34 , which had dominated @entity1 politically and militarily since the civil war , for the killing
the assassination sparked widespread protests that led to the election of an @entity69 bloc in parliament and the withdrawal of @entity34 troops from @entity1
@entity73 denies any role in @entity7 's killing , but the @entity10 investigation has found indications of @entity34 involvement
in a speech following wednesday 's announcement , @entity79 said he accepted the order freeing the suspects " because that shows the seriousness of the tribunal
" " we said before that we do n't want revenge from anyone , even those that we suspect were behind the crime , " @entity7 said
he added , " we do n't want any scapegoat
" the @entity10 tribunal opened in march , and the prosecution could take as long as 10 years , sources close to the probe said
investigators have had to navigate @entity1 's tightly interwound politics , where power is divided among the country 's @entity100 , @entity102 and @entity104 blocs and between pro- and @entity69 factions
@entity29 , the @entity106 movement that maintains its own militia , took up the generals ' cause and hailed their release
" their detention was a disgrace to the @entity1 legal system and everyone who was involved in their detention , " @entity29 lawmaker @entity111 said .
