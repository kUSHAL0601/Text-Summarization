imagine if going through airport security was just a matter of walking past a stretch of wall
no pat - downs , no x-rays , no metal detectors , and no need to remove any clothing
the harsh reality of today 's air travel is at strong odds with such a fantasy , but a new type of body scanner bears the promise to make every frequent traveler 's dream come true
it 's called " @entity24 " and it 's based on the established technology of " millimeter wave imaging " , which is used in hundreds of scanners currently deployed in airports the world over
but unlike those , @entity24 does not require you to enter a chamber , raise your arms and stand still while the machine analyzes your body : it is able , instead , to do its job as you simply walk by
" it 's a type of thermal imaging " , explains dr. @entity35 , the @entity36 - based physicist who invented the @entity24 , " so we see the difference in temperature between the body and objects that are n't part of the body
" current systems return a detailed image of the person being scanned -- passengers can in fact opt out and receive a pat - down instead -- but @entity24 uses a passive technology that can detect objects underneath clothing without revealing any anatomical details
and compared to standard metal detectors , it has the ability to spot non-metallic objects as well , such as liquids and gels
one of the problems with current scanners using the same technology is the high rate of false positives , sometimes greater than 50 percent
the @entity24 uses a significantly higher resolution that promises excellent accuracy and automatic detection of threats , according to its inventor
further advantages include the possibility to deploy the system outdoors and in a covert manner , which would make it an interesting option for military installations : dr. @entity75 has traveled to @entity76 , @entity77 , to test one of the four prototypes in existence at a @entity82 military base
but the main appeal of the scanner is surely its high throughput , over 400 people per hour
this could mean the end of security lines at the airport
the problem is to now make potential customers aware of the new technology : " it 's not like selling sunglasses , " says dr. @entity75 , " somebody already knows they want sunglasses , so they go and buy them , whereas with this system you have to explain the advantages with respect to what else is available on the market
" " it takes some time to sort of educate , i guess , the customer in that respect
so , it 's a process that needs to be gone through
