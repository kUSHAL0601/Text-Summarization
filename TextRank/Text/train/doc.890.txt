-- @entity2 's stunning hat - trick against @entity3 in the @entity4 in 2010 announced the @entity5 as a player the world should keep an eye on
that virtuoso performance ultimately came in a losing cause as the @entity12 side dumped @entity2 's @entity13 out of the @entity4 and went on to win the continent 's premier club competition
times have changed for @entity3 , who are struggling in @entity18 and staring down the barrel of a @entity21 exit after @entity2 inspired his @entity23 side to a 3 - 0 victory in the first leg of their last - 16 tie
@entity2 nodded @entity13 in front at @entity29 and his opener was added to by @entity31 and @entity32 as @entity34 ' side put themselves in a commanding position
they are now odds on to knock @entity3 out when they travel to @entity37 for the second leg next week , though @entity2 will miss the game after picking up a yellow card for diving , a theme that has dogged him in recent months
the 23 - year - old has now been booked for diving six times since the start of 2012 , his third yellow in the @entity21 leading to a one - match ban
@entity2 told @entity52 : " we played well and set tempo from the first whistle , we made it difficult for them
i 'm enjoying playing and it gives us a good lead going into the away leg
" while @entity13 continue to flourish in @entity58 , their @entity60 counterparts -- @entity62 champions @entity61 -- are not enjoying life in the @entity21
they won the @entity4 for the first time in their history last season , but became the first defending club to go out in the group stages this year
and after limping through against lowly @entity71 of the @entity72 in the last round , they sank to 1 - 0 defeat in @entity75 to @entity76 in the first leg of their tie
with the majority of @entity61 's fans vehemently opposed to the installation of @entity83 as their interim manager , and voicing their displeasure at every game , another lackluster display will not do much for the @entity89 's popularity
@entity91 's penalty decided the game -- he scored from the spot after being fouled by @entity94
@entity95 tested @entity96 with a volley just before halftime and @entity99 went close as the game entered its dying stages as his volley grazed the crossbar
" it was a difficult game , you could see the atmosphere and the pitch was not the best , " @entity83 told @entity104
" it was a soft penalty to give in this situation with so many officials
we can not change that now
the referee gave the penalty but no red card ? @entity117
" @entity60 side @entity118 drew 0 - 0 away at @entity119 in @entity120
the match was played at @entity123 's @entity122 due to security concerns in @entity119 's home territory of @entity126
@entity118 's returning @entity128 winger @entity127 had the best chance of the match but saw his effort saved while @entity119 's @entity133 striker @entity132 looked dangerous for the home side
@entity12 outfit @entity135 took a firm grip of their clash with @entity138 thanks to a 2 - 0 victory in @entity140
@entity135 , riding high in @entity18 , have a formidable lead to protect back in @entity142 next week after goals from @entity144 and @entity145
a late goal from @entity147 put @entity149 club @entity148 in control of their tie against @entity153 of the @entity72
@entity154 and @entity120 club @entity155 drew 0 - 0 in an ill tempered game in @entity157
@entity158 got his marching orders first for the visitors before @entity161 was dismissed two minutes later
@entity162 beat @entity120 side @entity163 2 - 0 in the first leg in @entity165
goals from @entity167 and @entity168 sealed the win while @entity163 had @entity170 sent off late on
an own goal from @entity172 handed @entity173 a 1 - 0 win over @entity128 side @entity175 in @entity176 .
