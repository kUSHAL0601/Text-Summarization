the terrorist attack on a natural gas installation at @entity2 in eastern @entity3 may be an isolated act of revenge for the @entity7 intervention in @entity8 -- or an ominous portent of things to come in @entity11 , where @entity13 militancy is gaining traction fast
the man claiming responsibility for the operation is a veteran jihadist who is also renowned for hostage - taking and smuggling anything from cigarettes to refugees

counter-terrorism experts differ as to how the attackers - in several pickup trucks - may have reached in @entity2 , but there are several roads and tracks across uninhabited desert from @entity58
on the other side of the border , a patchwork of militia prevails rather than any government presence
a spokesman for @entity71 told @entity73 news websites that the attack was in retaliation for @entity3 permitting @entity7 overflights as part of the intervention in @entity8
but regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in days
@entity81 , a former @entity82 diplomat who was abducted by @entity28 's followers in @entity84 in 2008 -- and met the man himself -- told @entity86 , " i suspect they have an intelligence wing and they are constantly looking for ways to grab westerners and embarrass the @entity92 and confuse our options
and that 's exactly what they are doing

" this is a promise from us that we will fight you in the midst of your countries and we will attack your interests , " he said
announcing the formation of an elite commando unit called " @entity115 , " @entity28 said it would be the shield against the " invading enemy
" wednesday 's attack in @entity3 was claimed in the name of that unit , which @entity28 said would include " the best of our youth and mujahideen , foreign and local supporters
" counter-terrorism analysts tell @entity86 the language suggests this group was dispatched to carry out an act of jihad rather than abduct foreigners for ransom
watch : @entity13 militants attack oil field , two dead " this feels much more like attacks staged in the past by other @entity38 affiliates , rather than another attempt to exchange hostages for ransom , as has often been @entity39 's practice , " said @entity133 , a long - time observer of @entity39 currently in @entity134
" @entity143 likely wants to show he is still engaged in active operations and he is not moving away from the fighting - especially at a time when other jihadists are in active combat against @entity7 troops in @entity8 , " he said
but it is also possible that @entity28 may try to bargain for the release of @entity38 operatives held in @entity3 jails
in his december message , he said , " to our captive people ... it is our promise and our debt as long as we live that we will liberate you , and we sacrifice our lives for you and everything we own to free you
" three @entity38 operatives were detained last july by @entity3 security services , but it 's not known whether they were close to @entity165

he traveled to @entity31 in 1991 in his late teens to fight its then @entity173 government
he returned to @entity3 as a hardened fighter with a new nickname " @entity176 " -- the " one - eyed " -- after a battlefield injury , and joined forces with the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) in its brutal campaign against the @entity3 regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters
@entity28 later claimed he met @entity38 founder @entity184 in the @entity185 in the mid 1990s
according to @entity187 , a @entity7 scholar who has extensively studied @entity39 , @entity186 rose steadily through the ranks to become the @entity179 commander for the @entity190
after a popular backlash against the terrorist group in @entity3 , @entity28 switched allegiance to a spin - off group -- the @entity39 -- in 2000 , and continued to operate in the @entity196 region
the @entity179 was the forerunner of @entity39 , which still counts many @entity3 in its leadership
@entity28 remains associated with this fissiparous group -- but is very much his own man
@entity200 , the overall leader of @entity39 , is said to have demoted @entity28 late last year from his position as ' emir of the @entity203
' @entity28 also feuded with a rival commander - @entity204 - one of the most violent and radical figures in @entity39
more than most @entity38 affiliates , @entity39 is divided into often competing groups
citing regional security officials , @entity208 reported @entity28 had been dismissed for " continued divisive activities , despite several warnings
" @entity58 sources tell @entity86 that @entity143 spent several months in @entity58 in 2011 , exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups , and securing weapons supplies
one @entity217 media report - cited in a @entity220 @entity219 report last year - said @entity28 had attended an event organized by @entity222 , an @entity13 commander , in the town of @entity224
there is no way to verify that
more recently , his center of operations was the dusty town of @entity231 in northern @entity8
another offshoot of @entity39 known as the @entity233 and @entity234 has taken over @entity231 and introduced @entity236 law , including public amputations and floggings
to make money , " @entity28 increasingly engaged in smuggling , earning the popular nickname ' mr. @entity241 ' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , " @entity187 in a 2010 @entity248
a wide theater criminality helped fund jihad
in december 2007 , @entity28 's followers murdered four @entity7 tourists in @entity73
two months later , they carried out a drive - by shooting on the @entity256 embassy in @entity257 , @entity73 's capital
" we set an ambush to kill the ambassador of the @entity264 entity in @entity73 before attacking the compound that housed the embassy and the nightclub that the ambassador was present in minutes before the attack , " @entity28 told a @entity73 journalist in november 2011
despite @entity220 satellite surveillance and the deployment of @entity3 and @entity73 troops to vulnerable areas , @entity38 affiliates in the @entity203 have grown in strength
the vast distances and empty landscapes - as well as a complex relationship with local tribes - play to their advantage
borders are difficult to seal : the rugged @entity3 - @entity8 frontier is as long as the distance from @entity284 to @entity285
in february 2012 , a cache of @entity288 missiles - looted from @entity58 armories - was discovered buried in the desert not far from in @entity2
@entity133 says the weapons - @entity297 nd sa - 24 " seem to have been at a midway point in the delivery process , " their destination and customer unknown
many @entity39 figures - @entity165 and @entity204 included - know the region minutely
indeed , @entity133 says some suspect that it was relatives of @entity204 who kidnapped a local @entity3 official a year ago - bundling him across the border into @entity58
in the view of one @entity58 source with close contacts among the region 's jihadists , @entity28 has often been a thorn in the side of @entity39 's leadership
" he was seen as a loose canon , running things in his own way , " the source told @entity86 recently
" and the last thing the leadership wanted was to antagonize the @entity220 just when it was trying to build up strength by stealth , below the radar
" however the hostage stand - off is resolved , that strategy has now been blown to pieces .
