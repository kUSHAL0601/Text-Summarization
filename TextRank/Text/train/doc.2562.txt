@entity0 -- archaeologists in @entity3 say they have discovered the remains of a home from the time of @entity7 in the heart of @entity9
the @entity10 said the find " sheds light on the way of life at the time of @entity7 " in the @entity17 settlement of @entity9 , where @entity18 believe @entity7 grew up
the find marks the first time researchers have uncovered the remains of a home in @entity9 from that time period , the @entity10 said in a statement
" the building that we found is small and modest and it is most likely typical of the dwellings in @entity9 in that period , " @entity24 , excavation director for the authority , said in the statement
" until now a number of tombs from the time of @entity7 were found in @entity9 ; however , no settlement remains have been discovered that are attributed to this period
" @entity18 believe that @entity37 , the mother of @entity7 , lived in @entity9 with her husband , @entity38
they believe @entity37 was in @entity9 when the @entity39 revealed that @entity37 would give birth to the son of @entity42 , a baby to be named @entity7
a number of burial caves that date to the early @entity47 period also were discovered close to the inhabited area during the excavations , the authority said
the discovery was made in the modern city of @entity9 during an excavation in advance of construction of the @entity55 of @entity9 , which will illustrate the life of @entity37
an association in @entity9 plans to conserve and display the home 's remains in the center
it will be built next to the @entity61 , which stands on the spot where @entity63 believe @entity37 once lived
the @entity61 is in the heart of @entity9 , above an older church and atop the ruins of a church from the @entity69 period
in the middle of these churches is a cave that was believed in antiquity to be the home of @entity7 ' family
researchers found storage pits and cisterns in the compound of the @entity61 , many of which date to the time of @entity7 , @entity3 archaeologists said
in the excavation , a large , broad wall that dates to the 15th century was exposed
it was constructed on top of and used the walls of an ancient building , the statement said
this earlier building -- the one that dates to the time of @entity7 -- consisted of two rooms and a courtyard in which a rock - hewn cistern collected rainwater
few artifacts were recovered from inside the building -- mostly fragments of pottery vessels from the first and second centuries
also , researchers found several fragments of chalk vessels , which were used by @entity17 in this period because such vessels were not susceptible to becoming ritually unclean , researchers said
another hewn pit , whose entrance was apparently camouflaged , was excavated and a few pottery fragments from the early @entity47 period were found inside it
" based on other excavations that i conducted in other villages in the region , this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the @entity17 to protect themselves during the great revolt against the @entity121 in [ @entity122 ] 67 , " @entity24 said .
