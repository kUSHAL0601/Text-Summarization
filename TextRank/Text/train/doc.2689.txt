-- @entity1 let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate @entity5 and prevent the country from attacking @entity7 , according to an @entity9 agent who interviewed the dictator after his 2003 capture
@entity7 leader @entity1 in an unknown location in @entity7 after his capture in 2003
according to a @entity17 report , @entity1 claimed he did n't anticipate that the @entity18 would invade @entity7 over @entity19 , agent @entity15 said on " 60 minutes , " scheduled for sunday broadcast
" for him , it was critical that he was seen as still the strong , defiant @entity1
he thought that ( faking having the weapons ) would prevent the @entity5 from reinvading @entity7 , " said @entity15
during the nearly seven months @entity15 talked to @entity1 , the agent hinted to the @entity7 that he answered directly to president @entity24 , @entity17 said in a posting on its web site
" he told me he initially miscalculated ... president @entity24 's intentions
he thought the @entity18 would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four - day aerial attack , " @entity15 said
" he survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack
" " he did n't believe the @entity18 would invade ? " correspondent @entity35 asked
" no , not initially , " @entity15 answered
once it was clear that an invasion was imminent , @entity1 asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks , @entity15 said
" and at that point , it would go into what he called the secret war , " the agent said , referring to the insurgency
but @entity15 said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of @entity1 's plan
" well , he would like to take credit for the insurgency , " he said
@entity1 had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that , @entity15 said
" he wanted to pursue all of @entity19 ... to reconstitute his entire @entity19 program
" @entity1 said he was proud he eluded @entity18 authorities who searched for him for nine months after the @entity18 - led invasion , @entity15 said
" what he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us , " @entity15 said
" he told me he changed ... the way he traveled
he got rid of his normal vehicles
he got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with , really just to change his signature
" @entity1 was hanged in 2006
