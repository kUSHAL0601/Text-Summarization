@entity0 -- @entity2 joined the @entity3 as a young man after responding to a newspaper want ad
now , at 57 , he could become its next director
president @entity9 on monday nominated @entity2 , his chief counterterrorism adviser , to lead the @entity3 , praising his pick as someone already closely connected to the agency and willing to fight on its behalf
" @entity2 knows what our national security demands : intelligence that provides policymakers with the facts , strong , analytic insights and a keen understanding of a dynamic world , " @entity9 said at the @entity18
@entity2 worked for the @entity3 for more than two decades and has been @entity9 's assistant for counterterrorism and homeland security since 2009
in that role , @entity9 said , @entity2 worked closely with many government agencies
the results were clear , the president said
" more @entity35 leaders and commanders have been removed from the battlefield than at any time since 9/11
" @entity2 has shaped the @entity18 's strategy to aggressively pursue suspected terrorists -- dramatically escalating the use of armed unmanned aircraft , often referred to as drones -- and to kill them in the ungoverned territories of @entity44 and in @entity45
@entity2 : drone attacks are legal , ethical he was also intimately involved in the run - up to the raid on the @entity50 compound in may 2011
" @entity2 is legendary even in the @entity18 for working hard , " @entity9 said
" he is one of the hardest working public servants i have ever seen
" in recent years , @entity2 has become well - known in @entity0 as the public face of the @entity18 's counterterrorism policies
now , if the @entity55 confirms his nomination , he 'll head an agency where many employees work behind the scenes
@entity2 praised the often anonymous work of @entity3 staffers monday and pledged to do everything he can to support them
" if confirmed as director i will make it my mission to make sure that the @entity3 has the tools it needs to keep our nation safe and that its work always reflect the liberties , the freedoms and the values that we hold so dear , " @entity2 told reporters shortly after @entity9 tapped him for the job
@entity9 announced @entity2 's nomination monday at the same time he tapped former sen. @entity77 to become defense secretary
both men , he said , " have dedicated their lives to protecting our country
" if the @entity55 confirms @entity2 's the nomination , he will replace retired gen. @entity84 , who stepped down from his job as @entity3 director in november amid revelations that he had engaged in an extramarital affair with his biographer
@entity84 resigned on november 9 as the @entity90 investigated whether his biographer , @entity91 , had inappropriate access to classified information

in a message to colleagues , @entity101 said he looked forward to welcoming @entity2 back to the @entity3
" those of you who know @entity2 can attest to his intellect , expertise , and prodigious work ethic
i have had the privilege of working with him for the better part of two decades , and i know him to be a public servant of the highest integrity
we have worked literally hundreds of tough issues together , and i have found that his approach always begins and ends with the question , ' what is the right thing to do here ? ' " he wrote
after the 2008 election , @entity2 was touted as a shoo - in for @entity3 director , but attacks from critics who claimed he supported the @entity127 administration 's policy of harsh interrogations prompted him to drop out of consideration for the job
returning to the @entity3 would be a homecoming of sorts for @entity2 , who spent 25 years there , developing a deep knowledge of the @entity135 and fluency in @entity137
" he knows what the president wants from his intelligence community , " said @entity138 , a former senior @entity3 official
" and he also knows how to deliver it from having worked at the agency
... there 'll be no learning curve for him
" after the nomination was announced , senate majority leader @entity146 said he hoped the @entity55 would give both @entity2 and @entity148 " a fair and constructive confirmation process
" debate over the drone program and @entity2 's position on @entity3 interrogations could make for some rough moments during his hearings
concerns about his past work at the @entity3 began to simmer again on monday , with the @entity157 calling on lawmakers to investigate whether @entity2 had been involved in torture , abuse or secret prisons during his past tenure at the @entity3 during the administration of president @entity127
opinion : @entity2 , @entity9 's drone warrior " this nomination is too important to proceed without the @entity55 first knowing what happened during @entity2 's tenures at the @entity3 and the @entity18 , and whether all of his conduct was within the law , " @entity166 , director of the @entity157 's @entity167 , said in a statement
sen. @entity175 , @entity176 , said he planned to examine @entity2 's record closely
" i appreciate @entity2 's long record of service to our nation , " @entity175 said in a statement , " but i have many questions and concerns about his nomination to be director of the @entity3 , especially what role he played in the so - called enhanced interrogation programs while serving at the @entity3 during the last administration , as well as his public defense of those programs
" even as she praised his record , sen. @entity195 , @entity196 , said she planned to raise the @entity3 detention and interrogation issue with @entity2
the fact that @entity2 is coming from the @entity201 and has frequently talked about the president 's views on camera could make him political fodder , said @entity206 , @entity1 's national security contributor
" he 's got to expect that ( @entity209 ) @entity208 is going to treat him as a political person who is fair game now , rightly or wrongly , " she said
on monday , @entity2 said he was prepared to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and field their questions
" while the intelligence profession oftentimes demands secrecy , " he said , " it is critically important that there be a full and open discourse on intelligence matters with the appropriate elected representatives of the @entity222 people
" compared to @entity148 , reaction to @entity2 nomination muted @entity1 's @entity227 reported in @entity228 ; @entity229 in @entity0
@entity1 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 also contributed to this report .
