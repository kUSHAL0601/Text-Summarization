@entity0 -- after the furor caused by a @entity7 magazine 's decision to publish topless photos of the @entity9 , she and prince @entity3 will be more than ready to get away from it all in the @entity11
as they arrive in the @entity0 on the next step of their @entity15 tour , " @entity3 " is the message the royal couple will see on huge billboards scattered across the capital , @entity21
and in a straw poll of residents , it 's clear the city is more than excited about the couple 's arrival on sunday
one man told me he will be heading to the airport early to catch a glimpse of them
he guessed half the population will turn out for the " once - in - a - lifetime " opportunity to see the @entity35 and @entity9
the couple are no doubt set for a big @entity11 welcome , involving not just big crowds but music and dancers
they will surely smile when they see their ground transport -- a pick - up truck dressed up as a canoe
@entity46 will pretend to row the couple into town
opinion : @entity51 privacy should start with @entity51 press later in the trip they will take to a real canoe , with rowers who will take them to a paradise island , accompanied by swimmers dressed as sharks
this leg of the tour will be full of photo opportunities -- but @entity9 and @entity3 may well have mixed views about that
the last leg to @entity67 was overshadowed by the @entity7 magazine closer 's decision to publish pictures of @entity9 sunbathing topless while on a private holiday with @entity3 in @entity7
she was upset , @entity3 is angry and they have both decided to take legal action against the publisher
but this is part of a bigger battle
they are trying to set a precedent ; drawing a line under what they see as creeping media intrusion
@entity3 is fiercely protective of his wife and he is determined to protect her from the fate of his mother , @entity89 , @entity89 , who was hounded by the paparazzi right up to the moment she died in @entity92
after @entity89 : how can intimate royal snaps be published in @entity7 ? what will hearten , and possibly surprise , @entity3 and @entity9 when they get here is that nobody is talking about the topless pictures
i ca n't see a mention of it in the papers and people seem much more interested in catching a glimpse of the couple and celebrating this moment when the @entity0 take a rare step into the global spotlight
it 's really only the media pack accompanying the tour that is discussing the photos -- because that 's what 's making the headlines in @entity116 , the @entity117 and @entity118
there is some apprehension among the accredited photographers that @entity9 and @entity3 will now become even more shy of the cameras , but the palace says the couple are determined to carry on with the tour as planned
they do n't want their trip to be ruined by the magazine scandal and it seems the islanders awaiting their arrival feel the same
the @entity35 and @entity9 look set to have some respite and some fun in the @entity0
but as this week has demonstrated , nothing about royal tours is predictable .
