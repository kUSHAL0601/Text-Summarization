-- @entity3 's newly launched satellite marks a " big deal " for @entity5 , the crossing of a major threshold and a public relations win for the secretive country 's new leader , @entity9 , experts say
the success , after years of failed attempts , triggered worries among world leaders about nuclear weapons , @entity16 and the balance of power in the @entity18
@entity20 defense secretary @entity19 called the launch " clear provocation
" experts do not believe @entity3 has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that @entity5 has now proved it can send long - distance
and the @entity20 believes the @entity3 may not have full control of the satellite they launched into space wednesday , according to one @entity20 official who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information
but the launch allowed the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage
@entity19 told @entity0 he is " very confident " that if @entity3 were to launch a missile at the @entity20 , the @entity20 military could guard against it
@entity3 silences doubters , raises fears with rocket launch " obviously the hope is that we never have to face that kind of threat , " @entity19 said
a central reason the @entity20 is working to " rebalance the @entity18 " is to deal with " the threat from @entity3 , " he added
there is " a path for @entity3 to end its isolation , but that requires abiding by its international obligations , " @entity50 spokesman @entity49 said wednesday
" ... it has chosen not to , and therefore , there will be consequences for that
" @entity60 is leading the global response , threatening to impose sanctions on @entity5 like those that have helped devastate @entity16 's economy
those efforts were under way wednesday in @entity69 meetings at @entity71 headquarters in @entity72 " members of the @entity69 condemned this launch , " the council said in a statement , calling it " a clear violation " of previous resolutions -- including one in april that demanded @entity3 halt any launches using ballistic missile technology
success raises stakes for @entity20 missile defense system the council considers the issue urgent , the statement said
@entity88 , @entity20 ambassador to the @entity71 , called the statement one of the swiftest and strongest she had seen the council make about @entity3
" now we go into the second phase " of discussions , she said : negotiations about what to do
@entity96 and @entity97 , @entity3 allies and two of the council 's permanent members , could exercise their veto power
the @entity20 and other nations may impose unilateral measures , senior administration officials warned
but @entity5 has ignored such threats before
new @entity71 sanctions are unlikely , but the council might step up pressure on @entity3 in other ways , said @entity110 , a professor with the @entity112 's @entity111 , who last year served on a @entity71 panel of experts monitoring sanctions already in place against @entity3
the council 's sanctions committee could add more @entity3 entities to the sanctions list , he said
it could also do more to enforce sanctions already in place , for example by increasing inspections of cargo leaving @entity3 to ensure no weapons technology is being shipped out
@entity3 may not have ' full control ' of satellite , @entity20 official says what the launch means wednesday 's success was a breakthrough for the reclusive , nuclear - equipped state
@entity3 " could sell this technology to others , including @entity16 and @entity142 , who have been regular customers of @entity3 's other missiles , " warns @entity137 , who analyzes the region for the @entity139
" they still have other technological thresholds to cross ( miniaturized warheads , reentry vehicle ) , but this was undeniably a major one
" the rocket blasted off from a space center on the country 's west coast and delivered a satellite into its intended orbit , the @entity3 regime said
the launch followed a botched attempt in april and came just days after @entity5 suggested that a planned launch could be delayed
@entity96 reaction key as neighbors decry @entity3 rocket launch @entity3 's previous claims of successful launches have been dismissed by the @entity20 and other countries
but this time , a @entity20 official confirmed that the object is in orbit
@entity20 officials were looking into whether it is an operating satellite , the official said
the regime 's state - run @entity172 said the satellite , named @entity179 , was " fitted with survey and communications devices essential for the observation of the earth
" the satellite itself is probably not very sophisticated , said @entity182 , a senior scientist with the @entity183
the regime showed it in april , and it was a small box with solar panels and a simple camera with some basic communication devices , he said
opinion : name and shame @entity96 over @entity3 launch he compared it to @entity196 , the first man - made satellite that @entity97 launched into space in 1957
the value lies in the launch rather than in the object that @entity3 now has floating above the @entity203 , @entity182 said
the regime does n't " really care so much what 's in it
" it 's a statement , @entity182 said
in @entity209 and @entity210 , people will hear about @entity3 's achievement -- and will probably be struck by its power , he said
any show of might can help strengthen @entity3 's position in international talks on numerous issues , including nuclear negotiations
the @entity210 government said the launch was confrontational and a " threat to the peace and stability of the @entity223 and the world
" @entity209 called it " intolerable
" the cost of launching a rocket @entity16 praises the launch as much of the world assails it @entity16 , meanwhile , praised @entity3 's move
gen. @entity232 , a senior @entity16 military official , expressed happiness about the launch , the semiofficial @entity231 reported
" experience has shown that independent countries , by self - confidence and perseverance , can quickly reach the height of self - sufficiency in science and technology
hegemonic powers , such as the @entity20 , are unable to stop the progress of such countries , " he said
@entity96 expressed regret that the launch had taken place , noting " concerns among the international community
" " we hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the @entity223 , " said @entity252 , a @entity253 spokesman
several governments criticized @entity5 's decision to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on its rocket program rather than on assisting its poor , malnourished population
@entity264 foreign secretary @entity263 said he deplored the fact that @entity3 " has chosen to prioritize this launch over improving the livelihood of its people
" the @entity271 's failed launch in april ended a deal for the @entity20 to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the country
in his father 's footsteps " i think this is very important to @entity9 to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people , " said @entity279 , a @entity3 specialist with the @entity280
" he is doing this despite the fact that he knows he is going to come into a lot of criticism in the region for it
" the launch has taken place during a period of power consolidation for @entity9 in which he has purged senior military officers in an apparent effort to stamp his authority on the regime 's leadership
" if @entity9 pulls off a successful long - range missile test , it 's a very important signal saying that ' yes , i , @entity9 , have replaced the powerful generals , ' " said @entity299 , a @entity300 junior faculty fellow at the @entity301
" it shows that ' i have found the right balance and i am now in charge
' " opinion : one small step for @entity9 the launch also ties in with important dates for the regime 's ruling dynasty
@entity5 had said this rocket launch would be " true to the behests " of @entity316 , the late @entity3 leader and father of @entity9
@entity316 died on december 17 last year , so the rocket launch took place just days before tearful mourners are expected to gather for the first anniversary of his death
experts had also speculated that @entity3 wanted this launch to happen before the end of 2012 , the year that marks the centenary of the birth of @entity329 , the founder of @entity3 and grandfather of @entity9
another factor may also be at play : the launch took place ahead of national elections in @entity209 on sunday and in @entity210 on december 19
@entity3 is a crucial foreign policy issue in both of those countries
the rocket took off wednesday morning and flew south over @entity209 's @entity340 islands
there were conflicting reports about how many parts fell into the sea

previous attempts by the @entity271 in 1998 , 2006 , 2009 and april of this year failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite into orbit and provoked international condemnation
the rockets launched in 1998 and 2009 flew for hundreds of kilometers but did n't succeed in deploying satellites , other countries and experts said at the time
@entity3 nonetheless insisted that both satellites did reach orbit , with @entity172 reporting that they were transmitting " immortal revolutionary " songs back to @entity203
the 2006 launch failed soon after takeoff and was n't reported by state media
in april , the @entity3 regime invited members of the international news media , including @entity0 , into the country to observe the preparations for its planned launch
but the strategy backfired when the rocket broke apart shortly after blasting off
on that occasion , state media took the unusual step of admitting the launch 's failure
timeline : @entity3 's rocket - fueled obsession @entity0 's @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 , @entity390 , @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 and @entity394 , and journalist @entity395 in @entity396 , contributed to this report .
