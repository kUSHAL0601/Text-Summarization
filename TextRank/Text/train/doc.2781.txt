@entity8 -- who served as @entity7 's vice president and then became acting president in november in an agreement brokered by the @entity12 -- is expected to be sworn in saturday in front of @entity1 's parliament
on monday , a formal inauguration will take place in @entity17 -- one that @entity7 is expected to attend
a spokesman for the country 's embassy in @entity22 said late friday that the president has returned home , after a short @entity26 visit for medical treatment
" as of saturday morning , @entity8 will be @entity1 's president and the inauguration on monday will only be ceremonial and a celebration in support for @entity1 's new leader , " said @entity28 , a member of @entity1 's parliament from @entity7 's @entity29
@entity8 received 99.8 % of the 6.6 million votes cast in tuesday 's election , according to @entity35 , chairman of the @entity36
@entity7 was wounded in a june assassination attempt at his presidential palace during battles between government troops and tribal fighters
a " massive celebration " was being planned for @entity7 , who will not necessarily disappear from @entity1 politics , said @entity44 , a senior @entity7 aide
" @entity7 has the option to continue involvement in politics and the power transfer deal will not force him to step aside , " @entity44 said
" he is the leader of the @entity29 and his voice and support will continue being heard in the @entity29
" @entity26 secretary of state @entity52 called the @entity1 election " another important step forward in their democratic transition process
