-- here 's the short , tragic story of a little car in @entity3 that nobody wanted
some time back in 2012 , a blue van was innocently parked along @entity6 in the village of @entity8 in @entity9
and it just sat there
the owner nowhere to be found
we still do n't know what happened to him
but we 'll just have to assume this person died or is in the middle of a really good " @entity20 " marathon
it 's how i lost most of my 20s
and a bowl of gravy
eventually , over the course of a year , @entity27 did her thing and the van became consumed by vines
amazingly , the foliage almost completely engulfed every part of the vehicle
and when people on the @entity38 started sharing pictures of this crazy car - bush , it sort of became a celebrity
not in the @entity43 kind of way
but in the drunk - and - naked - at - a - @entity47 @entity46 kind of way
" hey , who wants to see my shofar ? " " go home , rabbi
" so , people online started paying attention to this ever - growing mound of foliage with a funny name -- in @entity3 , vehicles that are unloved and abandoned are referred to as " jiangshiche " or " zombie cars
" eventually , police managed to contact the original owner of the " zombie car , " @entity65 , who explained that he had sold his blue van over three years ago but could n't recall the buyer 's name
so , authorities finally decided to just get rid of the damn thing
however , when they came to take it away , police were unable to dig the van out from beneath all the vines
it had simply become too thick and thorny
so , they just towed it off , foliage and all , hauling what appeared to be a giant bush slowly and hilariously down the highway
photos were taken , and , thus , this week , @entity3 's famous " zombie car " emerged once again to bask in the warm glow of the @entity38 's spotlight
so , that 's the short , tragic ( and completely pointless ) story of a car that nobody wanted , and the internet who loved it
to be honest , seeing this thing all alone kind of made me sad
i care about my car like a big , stupid child
and i only recently realized this
you see , the other day i was at the auto shop waiting on a minor repair -- as one does when you have no technical skills beyond heating things in the microwave
so , to pass time at the shop , i started thumbing through some of those hot rod magazines filled with pictures of shiny cars draped by scantily clad women
they had several different ones on the shelf -- lugs and @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity118 -- i do n't remember the exact titles , but you get the point
and as i turned my attention away from those glossy pages of beautiful , perfect steel and skin , and peered through the shop 's window into the garage , my gray @entity124 suddenly seemed incredibly ... unsexy
you know , because it 's a @entity124
really , there 's nothing " suddenly " about it
however , almost immediately , this fact did n't matter because , hey , it was mine
sure , it 's big , and stupid , and gray
but it gets me to @entity140
and , for that , i think it 's worthy of a sexy photo shoot
" there ya go , @entity147 , get nice and close to those side - impact air bags
@entity150 ! " anyway , my @entity124 is awesome , and you should check it out in next month 's issue of @entity116 and @entity117
