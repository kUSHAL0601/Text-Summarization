-- built like a wrestler , when @entity3 says " do n't call me baby , " you 'd be advised to listen
the 21 - year - old has had enough with the tennis world labeling him as " @entity7 " following comparisons with 17 - time grand slam champion @entity9
after winning the @entity13 and @entity14 junior titles in 2008 , his coach @entity10 at the time hailed @entity3 as the next @entity9 -- a man who the former @entity16 player had worked with previously
it was supposed to be a compliment -- a warning to the rest of the world that @entity22 had unearthed a tennis player ready to emulate one of the greatest to have ever picked up a racket
but @entity10 's comment has weighed heavily on @entity3 's shoulders ever since with the watching world awaiting his rise to stardom
it was @entity10 who oversaw @entity9 's first 10 @entity34 @entity34 titles and his first grand slam title win at @entity14 at 2003
and while @entity3 would love to follow in the @entity38 star 's footsteps , he wants to make it clear that he is his own man -- not @entity9 mark two
" you know , all the comparisons , i think that i definitely want people to stop with that , " he told @entity0 's @entity41
" of course we have some similarities here and there
i 'm flattered with that and actually , i thought it was really cool at the beginning
" but with time , i 've realized what i am
it 's something that is definitely not what the other person is , so i 'm trying to build up my own style and when i 'm on court , i do my own shots
" i think that 's eventually what everyone will see
" @entity3 has been plotting his rise to the top since the very first time he stepped onto a court as a child with his father @entity67 , a tennis coach in their native city of @entity70
his single - handed backhand , which is so unusual among players of his age group , was honed under his father 's gaze
" i actually never thought of any other sport , " said @entity3 , recalling his formative years
" my father was a tennis coach and my mum was a former volleyball player , so i was in the sport area in general
" but the only thing i was always telling my parents was : ' i just want to play tennis
' " obviously , my dad showed me a few shots
i was six or seven and i was just playing regularly
" such was @entity3 's talent during his teenage years that he was soon off to @entity86 to train at the prestigious @entity87 just outside of @entity88
it was there that he began to show glimpses of his future potential , winning a whole host of junior tournaments on his way to becoming the third youngest player to break into the world 's top 100 in 2011
but it was his decision to leave @entity86 to join up with the " @entity101 " in @entity16 last november which has helped propel his career to the next level
working alongside ex-world @entity108 @entity104 and the former doubles partnership of @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity3 reached the @entity111 final before losing to @entity113 @entity112 in january
" all the guys from @entity115 are amazing and all of them have incredible experiences from the tour , " @entity3 said
" they all have something to bring to the table so that makes it a lot more interesting
" you take a little from this one , pick a little from that one , and then the next thing you know , you 're getting sort of completed and , that helps you during the weeks
" while @entity3 has yet to propel himself into the top 10 -- he has reached a career - high 28th this year -- he has begun to show signs of improvement , most noticeably during last month 's @entity130
the young pretender gave @entity132 one of the toughest tests on clay that the seven - time @entity137 champion has endured in recent years
a full - blooded display against the undisputed king of the surface was eventually curtailed by defeat in three sets , but the fruits of his labor were bared for all to see
" i had kind of rough matches in the past weeks so it gave me of course a lot of confidence , even though i lost them , " @entity3 said
" i felt quite good about myself and the way i was progressing and of course , these hours in the gym
" they 're just a must
you just kind of do it and it does n't matter if it 's sunday or saturday , you 've just got to do what you 've got to do
" i mean basically , you 've got to make it
" away from the court , and when he 's not working out , @entity3 has plenty of other interests to keep him busy
while he remains coy on his private life , having been linked romantically to women 's tennis stars @entity163 and @entity166 in the past , he is more than happy to divulge his other extracurricular activities
" i enjoy good food , " he said
" that 's one of the things
i love good restaurants and i love cars and all these things
" we 're away for 25 weeks a year so you appreciate the time when you 're off
" if you can get it with friends and family and you know , people around that you thought you had n't seen for a while , it 's always good
" of course if you get the chance to go somewhere to get a few days away here and there , i mean i 'd definitely get that
