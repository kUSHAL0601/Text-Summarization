-- tiny diamonds found in the soil are " strong evidence " a comet exploded on or above @entity5 nearly 13,000 years ago , leading to the extinction of dozens of mammal species , according to a study
diamonds found in @entity5 soil suggest a comet led to the extinction of dozens of mammal species
the scientific report also suggests the cataclysm also reduced the population of the earliest people to inhabit the region and triggered a 1,300 - year - long cold spell that stretched around the world
the heat generated by the extraterrestrial impact likely melted much of a glacier that once covered the @entity17 , sending a massive flood down the @entity25 , the study said
according to the report , the cold waves of glacial runoff into the @entity28 shifted @entity31 currents , changing climate patterns throughout the world in a cooling period known as the @entity35
" a rare swarm " of comets rained over @entity5 about 12,900 years ago , sparking fires that produced choking , leading " to the extinction of a large range of animals , including mammoths , across @entity5 , " the report said
the study was conducted by a group of eight archaeologists and geologists from the universities of @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53
their findings were published friday in the journal @entity57
ireport.com : have you ever seen a comet ? show us the prehistoric humans known to have inhabited the continent at the time of the event -- hunters and gatherers dubbed the @entity69 culture -- suffered a major decline in population in the aftermath , the scientists said
the scientists studied layers of sediment dated to 12,900 years ago at six @entity5 locations , including one directly on top of a @entity69 site in @entity79 , @entity80
each layer was rich in nanodiamonds , which are produced under high - temperature , high - pressure conditions created by cosmic impacts , the report said
" the nanodiamonds that we found at all six locations exist only in sediments associated with the @entity35 boundary layers , not above it or below it , " said @entity88 archaeologist @entity87
" these discoveries provide strong evidence for a cosmic impact event at approximately 12,900 years ago that would have had enormous environmental consequences for plants , animals and humans across @entity5
" the other sites studied were in @entity104 , @entity105 ; @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 , as well as @entity110 , @entity111 ; and @entity112 , in the @entity114 province of @entity115 .
