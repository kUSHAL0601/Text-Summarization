@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 lawmaker is calling for a special investigation into a top intelligence official 's alleged release of information on a @entity1 spy ring in the @entity9
the deputy chairman of the @entity1 parliament 's security committee wants a special commission to analyze how information on the @entity1 agent got out , said @entity16 , a spokeswoman for lawmaker @entity18 's office
@entity16 said the lawmaker had confirmed a newspaper report identifying a colonel in @entity1 's @entity22 as the source who tipped off @entity9 officials
and the lawmaker sees the information as a significant blow to the image of @entity1 's intelligence network , she said
the article , published in the respected @entity1 newspaper @entity31 thursday , said " the betrayer , " known as " @entity33 , " fled @entity1 three days before @entity1 's president arrived in the @entity9 for meetings with president @entity36 -- just days before ring was broken up
neither the @entity38 nor the @entity39 would comment on the report
the paper quotes a source who says the @entity9 , fearing that the @entity1 intelligence agency would pull its agents from the @entity9 , rounded them up and arrested them
in july , 10 @entity1 agents were handed over by the @entity9 in exchange for four @entity1 prisoners
the article in @entity31 says @entity33 , who was identified only by last name , headed up the branch of the @entity22 that oversees agents working abroad undercover but without diplomatic credentials
" we know who he is and where he is
he betrayed either for the money or he was caught for something
and there 's no doubt that there is a @entity63 has been sent for him , " an unidentified source was quoted as telling @entity31
@entity63 was an assassin sent by @entity65 to @entity66 to kill @entity67 in 1940
" he does n't have an enviable fate , " the source tells the paper
" he will drag this with him for the rest of his life and every day he will fear vindication
" the paper says that @entity33 was present in the facility in the @entity9 where one of the spies arrested this summer was held
it claims he also took the files on one of those spies with him to the @entity9
the colonel 's son also fled @entity1 for the @entity9 not long before the spies were arrested , according to the paper
@entity2 's @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 contributed to this report .
