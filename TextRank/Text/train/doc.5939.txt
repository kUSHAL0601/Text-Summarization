-- fourteen members of @entity3 's family were deported to @entity4 from @entity5 friday , less than a week ahead of the first anniversary of his death at the hands of @entity10 commandos
among those aboard the private plane that left at 2 a.m. local time were @entity3 's three widows and two daughters , said @entity16 , a family attorney
earlier this month , the five women were sentenced to 45 days of house arrest for living in @entity5 illegally
their detention ended last week
@entity16 said the time served began march 3 , when the five were formally taken into custody
" the family was kept safe and sound in a guest ( safe ) house , " according to a @entity5 @entity27 statement
" they have been deported to the country of their choice , @entity4 , today
" two of the widows are @entity4 , while one is @entity35
the daughters are ages 17 and 21 , @entity16 said
the widows have been identified by @entity10 and @entity5 officials as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
judge blocks release of @entity3 death photos because all five defendants confessed to impersonation , illegal entry into @entity5 and staying illegally in @entity5 , there was no need for a trial , @entity16 said recently
he represents four of the five relatives
@entity3 was killed by @entity53 at his @entity55 compound may 2 , 2011
the @entity58 leader spent years on the run in @entity5 after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children with @entity64 , at least one of whom was born in a government hospital , she told @entity5 investigators
no credible threat of attack on anniversary of @entity3 's death a deposition taken from @entity64 gives the clearest picture yet of @entity3 's life while international forces hunted him
he and his family moved from city to city with the help of @entity5 who arranged " everything " for them , @entity64 said , according to the deposition
widow tells how @entity3 lived on the run she told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in @entity5
authorities in @entity4 have repeatedly declined to comment on the matter
