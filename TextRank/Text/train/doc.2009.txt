-- you may inadvertently be getting more than you bargained for when you put paprika in your chicken paprikash
a new @entity5 report , " pathogens and @entity16 in spices , " says that 12 % of @entity7 spice imports are contaminated with bug parts , rodent hairs and other ingredients more appropriate to a witches ' brew than your mother 's favorite recipe
the @entity5 study also found that 7 % of spice imports the inspectors examined were contaminated with salmonella
@entity22 are toxic bacteria that can trigger diarrhea , fever , and abdominal cramps
the amount of " filth " the @entity5 found in imported spice was twice that found in other kinds of imported food
the report characterized this as a " systemic challenge
" the agency conducted the research to figure out what kind of risks the contamination poses to the @entity7 public and what the @entity5 can do to lower any kind of health risks
there is good news , however , regardless of the ick factor
the study did find that only a tiny fraction of the @entity7 public has gotten sick from spices
in the 37 years of records examined , it found only 14 outbreaks worldwide associated with spices and seasonings , resulting in fewer than 2,000 human illnesses and 128 hospitalizations
the @entity5 characterized that as a " relatively small number of outbreaks " compared to other foodborne illness
the @entity5 says the issue may be underreported
patients often forget to list spices when they describe what they ate before they became sick
people also eat spices in such tiny quantities that there is less exposure to pathogens than with food which is eaten in larger servings
" we would agree ready - to - eat spices should be clean and meet @entity5 standards and be pathogen - free , " said @entity73 , executive director of the @entity74
" we did find it really interesting that the @entity5 said they were going to use this report to develop a plan to reduce illness , but if you look at the data we do n't think that 's a significant problem
that 's a small number of illnesses
" 22,000 pounds of meat recalled ; possible @entity87 the report points out most of the contamination likely comes from what it describes as " poor storage practices
" @entity73 said it is not a big surprise the @entity5 would find some issues with spices that arrive in the @entity7 in raw form
tests did not distinguish between the ready - to - eat product that has been cleaned overseas or the raw product
spice can come to the @entity7 cleaned and bottled in another country , or in big sacks and containers that then go to a commercial facility , @entity73 said
at the facility the spice is cleaned in what 's called a " microbial reduction process , " in which the spice is cleaned several times to get rid of the sticks and stones and those scary - sounding bug parts
since most spices can not be grown in the @entity7 , much of the supply comes from countries like @entity119 and @entity120 -- the two countries that have the highest rate of contamination
@entity73 said much of the spice that comes into the @entity7 comes through a complex supply chain
that 's where contamination can enter , she said , starting with the small farmers who gather the crop , dry it and then often store it until they need the cash
it then goes to a collector where it is again stored until there is enough of a supply from local farmers
only then is it shipped to a bigger facility for treatment
" it goes through some very small hands before it gets to the first processing stage , " @entity73 said
the @entity142 of @entity119 is currently working directly with farmers to put additional safety practices in place and to lower the risk of contamination , the @entity5 said
the agency has provided some food safety training in @entity119 , as has the @entity74
the @entity5 says it has increased its inspections of spice facilities and will take further action to strengthen the spice safety net
