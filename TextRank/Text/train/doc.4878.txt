@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday accused veteran rep. @entity3 of 13 violations of @entity2 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity8
the charges accused the 20 - term @entity10 from @entity11 of using his influence to solicit donations for a college policy center in his name from corporate heads and others with business before the powerful @entity20 that @entity3 chaired until forced to give up the leadership position earlier this year
other charges involve alleged income tax and financial disclosure violations , as well as improper use of government mail service and letterhead
" @entity28 is what 's at stake here ; the very credibility of the @entity2 itself before the @entity41 people , " said rep. @entity32 , the ranking @entity33 on a subcommittee that will hold a trial - like hearing on the charges against @entity3
@entity32 spoke at the subcommittee 's first meeting , described as an organizational session
@entity3 was not required to attend and did not show up to hear the first public disclosure of the formal charges against him
asked later about his response to the charges , @entity3 sounded contrite in saying he may have been " overzealous " in serving the public but took some comfort that the allegations involved no " corruption " or " self - dealing
" " i ca n't make an excuse for serious violations , but i can have an explanation of my intent , " he said
" and to large degree that 's what my life has been all about -- intent
" @entity3 said it was " a very , very rough period for me and my family , but we all , including my community , will get by this
" in the days leading up to the hearing , @entity3 had said he welcomed the completion of a two - year investigation by the ethics committee so that he could finally respond to specific accusations against him
according to documents released by the committee , @entity3 first learned of the charges being pursued by an investigating subcommittee on june 17
he filed a motion to have the charges dismissed , which the investigating panel denied , the documents showed
in a document dated wednesday , @entity3 's lawyers challenged the scope of the charges against him , saying @entity3 " did not abuse his official position or enrich himself financially
" " he did not target for solicitation foundations , corporations or individuals with business before the @entity91 , nor did he offer or provide preferential treatment or favors to potential contributors , " the document said
" he received no prohibited benefit , direct or indirect , from his work on behalf of this program that violates the ethics rules
" however , the document said @entity3 " recognizes that the public would have been better served if he had consulted the @entity102 staff in advance " of soliciting funding for the college center
@entity3 said this week that his lawyers were in talks with committee lawyers on a possible deal to settle the case without a hearing
when thursday 's hearing was delayed for 55 minutes with no explanation , rumors of an imminent agreement quickly spread
@entity116 : sound off on this story however , the panel gathered and held the hearing , and it remained unclear whether a settlement avoiding the spectacle of a trial hearing was possible
according to the charges , @entity3 allegedly failed to report more than $ 600,000 on financial disclosure reports and improperly used a rent - subsidized apartment as a campaign office for over a decade and failed to pay taxes on a home in the @entity129
@entity3 " argues that errors on his personal taxes do not implicate discharge of his official responsibilities , " committee investigators concluded in response to @entity3 's request to have the charges dismissed
he " appears to be operating under the erroneous belief that the only conduct subject to discipline is conduct directly related to the discharge of his official responsibilities
" an investigative subcommittee report on @entity3 's dealings , available on the committee 's website , detailed a lengthy series of meetings the congressman held with business leaders to raise funds for the @entity154 at the @entity155
his repeated attempts to woo potential donors violated the @entity2 's solicitation and gift ban , the report said
among other things , the report stated that @entity3 met with a lobbyist for insurance giant @entity164 in april 2008 with the objective to " close " a $ 10 million " gift for the @entity167
" at the meeting , " @entity164 raised concerns about a potential donation , including the potential headline risk , " the report stated
but @entity3 pushed ahead , asking " @entity164 , at least twice , what was necessary to get this done
" during the period of time that @entity3 was seeking donations from @entity164 , according to committee investigators , the company was lobbying the @entity2 on several tax and trade issues -- matters over which @entity3 exercised considerable influence
it also noted that , in march 2007 , he used congressional letterhead to send notes to business leaders such as @entity186 , in which he requested meetings to discuss the @entity167
the congressman 's " acceptance of favors and benefits from donors to the @entity167 ... might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties , " the report concluded , adding that the " accumulation of ( @entity3 's ) actions reflected poorly on the institution of the @entity2 and , thereby , brought discredit to the @entity2
" in the july 28 response , @entity3 's lawyers argued that some of the cited infractions were unintended in his effort to help the college
" if he mistakenly used the wrong letterhead or other modest resources in this worthy cause , the error was made in good faith , " the document said
" it is undisputed that every single charitable contribution in this case went to @entity155 , a public educational institution , and not to the congressman , " it said , later adding that " the uncontroverted evidence is that congressman @entity3 never suggested that any donor to the @entity220 would receive favorable consideration in legislative matters and never gave preferential treatment to any contributor
" @entity32 said the allegations against @entity3 , if proven , would violate " the most fundamental code of conduct " for @entity2 members
rep. @entity230 of @entity231 , a @entity10 who led a two - year ethics subcommittee investigation of @entity3 , said it was a difficult job
" the task is even more difficult when the subject has befriended and mentored so many new members , and i 'm one of them , " @entity230 said
another ethics committee member , @entity33 rep. @entity33 of @entity239 , said " this is truly a sad day where no one , regardless of their partisan stripes , should rejoice
" @entity3 temporarily stepped down as @entity20 chairman earlier this year following the announcement of an ethics investigation of several allegations , including failure to pay taxes on the @entity129 residence
the @entity2 previously admonished @entity3 for violating rules on receiving gifts
specifically , the committee found that @entity3 violated @entity2 gift rules by accepting reimbursement payments for travel to conferences in the @entity259 in 2007 and 2008
@entity3 , whose autobiography that discusses his @entity262 experience is titled " and i have n't had a bad day since , " told reporters earlier thursday that " i have to reassess that ( statement ) " in light of the pending hearing
house speaker @entity268 said thursday -- in response to a question about @entity3 -- that there must be " accountability " and " transparency " in cases of ethical transgressions
" holding a high ethical standard is a serious responsibility ... and a top priority " for the @entity2 @entity280 leadership , she said
in terms of political fallout from cases such as @entity3 's , " the chips will fall where they may , " she said
congressional democrats have reportedly expressed concern that an extended public airing of the charges against @entity3 could damage the party 's prospects in the november midterm elections
@entity1 's @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 contributed to this report .
