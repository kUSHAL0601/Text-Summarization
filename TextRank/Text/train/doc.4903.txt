@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 will not be saving @entity4 this time , but the residents of @entity0 are hopeful his fans will
@entity0 , @entity1 wants a companion statue for @entity3 , but the economy may block its efforts
the villain is the economy
despite being about $ 70,000 shy of the funding needed to cast a figure in the image of the fictional " @entity18 " reporter , this town of 6,000 residents says it 's going forward with a ground breaking
@entity0 wants its @entity4 statue
there are no skyscrapers here
if you search the local telephone book you wo n't find any familiar names
there 's no @entity27 or @entity28
the closest @entity29 lives in @entity30 , @entity1
if you call the nearby nuclear plant and ask about kryptonite they wo n't take you seriously
most days of the year you can walk about town without seeing anyone in a cape or leotard
very little about @entity0 , @entity1 , resembles the metroplex made famous in " @entity39 , " except for the constant presence of @entity3
his statue stands 15 - feet tall outside the @entity43 and 50 yards away is the county justice center
in 1972 , @entity45 , the current owner of the character , declared the town the official home for @entity3
since then , it 's residents have fashioned a monument , a museum , and an annual festival around the superhero
" we 've had groups from as far away as @entity58 and @entity59 , " said @entity55 , one of the festival organizers
" there 's a family that comes every year from @entity63
" and each year @entity64 is honored
she 's the original @entity4
@entity64 starred opposite @entity66 in the 1950s " @entity68 " television series and it 's her image the local chamber of commerce wants to immortalize in a statue
the town first came up with the idea of a companion statue for @entity3 in 2005
a lot has changed since then , primarily the economy
" we 've been affected pretty heavily because most of our revenue comes from the casino , " said mayor @entity77
the @entity81 is the closest thing this little burgh has to a tall building
" their revenue has been down as much as 30 percent , " noted @entity77
and the @entity0 budget is not bulletproof either
the town has not been replacing some workers as they retire , because of the lower tax receipts
what about the prospects for @entity4 ? " if there 's any money out there we 're going to find it , " said the mayor
@entity99 has agreed to foot half the statue 's bill , if the @entity102 provides a matching grant
private donations have raised only $ 9,000 in four years , not even enough to pay for the monument 's base
" they were good initially , but slowed down to a trickle , " said @entity107 with the @entity108
" we 're committed to the project , " despite the economy
the city plans to break ground for the statue on june 11 , during the opening night of their annual @entity3 festival , even though the state is months away from a decision on their grant request
@entity4 's fate , like in most issues of the comic , is " to be continued ... "
