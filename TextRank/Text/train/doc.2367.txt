-- record - breaking daredevil @entity1 completed sunday what he called his most challenging feat to date : a tightrope walk between two skyscrapers 600 feet above downtown @entity6 , partly blindfolded
crowds below cheered on the seventh - generation aerialist , who wore a microphone during his untethered walk
the " @entity13 " walk was broadcast on @entity14
" i love @entity6 , and @entity6 definitely loves me
what an amazing roar , " the 35 - year - old said as he crossed above the @entity17
the walk consisted of two parts , starting from @entity22 's @entity21 , about 588 feet high
he crossed above the @entity17 to the @entity24 in just under seven minutes , finishing 671 feet above the street , according to @entity13 's website
after he returned to the @entity21 , he crossed to the @entity27 blindfolded in one minute and 20 seconds
as a member of the famous @entity29 , founded by his grandfather @entity30 in the 1920s , @entity1 is no stranger to death - defying stunts
he walked across a wire 1,500 feet above a river in @entity35 in june 2013 , becoming the first person to traverse the gorge near @entity38 in @entity35
before that , he made a record journey across @entity41 in 2012
@entity42 also runs in the @entity1 family
great - grandfather @entity30 was killed at 73 while attempting to walk between two buildings in @entity45 in 1978
but on sunday , @entity1 made it look easy
" i 'm so blessed for these opportunities , " he said during his walk
" you guys watching think i 'm crazy , but this is what i was made for
