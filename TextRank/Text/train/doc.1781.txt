-- construction crews began working on nearby tent cabins in @entity3 not long after @entity4 and her family arrived at @entity6
@entity4 had reserved seven nights in one of the park 's 91 " signature tent cabins , " now at the epicenter of a hantavirus investigation
eight visitors to the park have contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome , and three of them have died
officials on thursday confirmed that someone who stayed in another part of @entity6 contracted hantavirus
when campers checked out , crews moved in , spraying the tent cabins with bleach , replacing canvas and insulation , and hammering in new boards , @entity4 said
curious about what was going on , she asked a crew member whether it was annual maintenance
the worker said they were dealing with a mice problem
" when we checked in , nothing was said to us , " said @entity4 , who got to the park august 18
" we had no clue that anything was going on
there was no word to us , nothing about a rare and deadly disease
" @entity44 , spokesman for @entity6 , said the @entity45 issued a news release august 16
he said park officials were handing out fliers and fact sheets to park visitors and had the notices at the front desk
" we certainly had an extensive outreach effort , but i ca n't guarantee that every person was contacted during that week , " @entity44 said
@entity4 , 38 , said she and her boyfriend , @entity55 , 40 , did not find out about the hantavirus investigation until august 24 , when they found a note on their cabin that said they needed to be immediately relocated
when she went to the registration desk to find out what was going on , she was told about the hantavirus cases and given a pamphlet about the virus
we 've been taking a lot of vitamins and have been watching each other , " @entity4 said
" the minute anybody exhibits any flu - like symptoms , we 're going straight to the doctor
" @entity44 said that the situation was fluid and that officials inspected , cleaned and disinfected the cabins to make sure they were as rodent - proof as possible
@entity77 , the park 's primary concessioner , hired a private contractor to retrofit the cabins and eliminate any gaps between the canvas and the wood where rodents could get in
" we were very transparent up front , " @entity44 said
officials closed the cabins in late august , and they are closed indefinitely
the situation has proved unsettling for @entity4 's mother , @entity90 , who accompanied her daughter , her grandson and @entity93 to @entity6
she sat reading her book while the crews worked
at one point , she saw workers remove insulation from a tent nearby that an animal had shredded
the bottom of it was discolored by urine and had droppings
although @entity4 is concerned about potential exposure and is unhappy with the way the situation was handled , she and other campers said the hantavirus cases will not deter them from future vacations in @entity6 or from camping elsewhere
" will i camp again ? absolutely , yes , i will go camping again , " @entity4 said , adding that @entity6 is one of her favorite places
" that was not camping
that was staying in a crummy tent that was a public health risk , a public health nightmare
" @entity118 , 38 , of @entity119 , @entity120 , went to @entity6 in early august with relatives
the group rented four tent cabins in @entity3 but did not stay in the signature tent cabins
she already has reservations to stay in the same place next year
" are you going to live your entire life in a bubble because you are afraid you are going to be exposed to something ? you just try to make the best choices you can for your family , " she said
" i do n't feel like enjoying nature like that is putting them at risk
" @entity139 , 31 , of @entity140 , @entity120 , is a frequent camper
many wild animals are carriers of disease , he said , and there are always risks when you stay outdoors
@entity139 stayed in the @entity148 campground in @entity6 in early june and proposed to his girlfriend on the top of @entity151
" i think it could happen anywhere , " he said
" it 's just something to think about whenever you go camping
" health officials have sent warnings about the hantavirus cases to park visitors from 39 other countries
the @entity163 has said that up to 10,000 people could be at risk
@entity6 , which receives about 4 million visitors a year , has been contacting people who stayed in the signature tent cabins between mid-june and the end of august
seven of the eight people who contracted the virus stayed in those cabins
the eighth person stayed in multiple @entity174 in @entity6 in july , the @entity45 said thursday
that visitor had mild symptoms and is recovering
six of the people who contracted the virus are from @entity120
one visitor is from @entity181 and the other is from @entity183
officials are advising anyone with hantavirus symptoms to seek immediate medical attention
rare but serious , hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by a virus that people get through contact with the urine , droppings or saliva of infected rodents , primarily deer mice
in @entity120 , the deer mouse is the only carrier of hantavirus , and about 14 % of mice in the state carry the disease , according to the @entity203
symptoms appear one to six weeks after exposure and may mimic a cold or the flu
symptoms include fever , chills , headaches , gastrointestinal problems , muscle aches and fatigue
it is not contagious from person to person
what you need to know about hantavirus people have contracted hantavirus while camping before , said @entity222 , a medical doctor and a professor at the @entity225 's @entity224 in @entity226
@entity222 , who has worked extensively on hantavirus , said a man camping on the floor of the @entity230 contracted the virus after a mouse ran across his face
" it does happen , but probably the risk to any individual person is pretty low , " he said
in general , the virus requires an active infestation ; many people who have contracted the virus have reported seeing live or dead mice
@entity222 said he would n't be surprised if there were previous cases of hantavirus connected to @entity6 that had n't been tracked back to the park
before this year , @entity6 had one hantavirus case in 2000 and one in 2010
" i think that they probably are going to need to look at their practices more carefully in that particular site , " @entity222 said
even though campers are warned to protect food from bears , there is no doubt a lot of food in the area , which can attract mice
" you ca n't have that many visitors packed in that tight with food , " he said
" it might not be possible to do what they are doing ( at @entity3 ) in the long - term
