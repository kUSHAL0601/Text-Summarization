-- his declaration grabbed the ear : i am the son of a mass murderer whose dark deeds and enigmatic identity spawned silver screen thrillers
i am the son of the @entity10
@entity11 of @entity12 , @entity13 , may be the latest person to claim lineage with the infamous psycho murderer who inspired the movies " @entity10 " and " @entity17
" but he 's not the first to say he is descended from a man who police suspect killed five people in northern @entity21 in the late 1960s , then taunted the public with creepy letters to the media
@entity10 has never been caught
and he has , in all , 37 people 's lives on his conscience , he has said in his cryptic claims of responsibility
he also may have spawned a child
others before @entity11 have purported to be his offspring
there 's the self - proclaimed " @entity36 , " @entity37 , who has appeared on tv news and a crime show touting his deceased stepfather @entity40 as the crazed killer
he said his stepfather 's handwriting was similar to the killer 's
there 's @entity46 , who said she wrote some of the claims of responsibility for her father , @entity50 , when she was 7 years old
her half - sister called her claims lies
there 's @entity54 , who says his father was a columnist for the @entity56 -- the paper to which the @entity10 sent his mocking notes
his claim too was discounted
whether @entity11 's contention will hold true is yet to be seen
@entity13 man claims his biological father was @entity10 @entity11 's biological father @entity11 is accusing his deceased biological father , @entity65 the vice president of a cleaning company has compiled his account into a book published by @entity69
" @entity73 " reveals @entity10 's true identity for the first time , the publisher says -- a claim @entity74 , @entity75 and others will likely dispute
@entity11 sleuthed for a decade through government files and news articles and hunted down relatives to dig up evidence , @entity69 said
the result is a narrative story about a " boy with disturbing fixations , " who ca n't process being jilted by prospective mates and lets out his rage in a spate of murders
@entity75 has described going to similar lengths with his obsession that his father could be the real killer
he even hired a handwriting analyst to compare his father 's handwriting to letters the proclaimed mass murderer mailed to the press
but since @entity11 's account is new , investigators may take a gander at it to see if it helps them solve the case that is still open
the author -- who was abandoned as an infant by his biological parents , then later adopted -- promises to answer questions in the case that have been open for nearly 50 years
police in @entity21 have said they were n't aware of the book or its claims
" it 's an open and active case , so we do n't comment , " @entity113 police spokesman @entity112 told @entity0
" but ( it 's ) certainly something our homicide investigators will take a look at
" gruesome murders the @entity10 stalked his victims with knives and guns in 1968 and 1969 and once even dressed as an executioner
he craved publicity , taunting police in letter after letter to newspapers
the letters were often written in a cipher he seemed to have invented himself
" if you read these letters , he was getting a tremendous thrill out of terrifying the public , " said @entity131 , a forensic scientist who has studied the letters
the @entity10 's last known victim , @entity113 cab driver @entity10 , was shot to death in his cab in 1969
the killer cut out a piece of @entity140 's blood - stained shirt and mailed it to a newspaper , along with a letter
police believe the killings stopped , but the letters kept coming until 1974
in the 1970s , a man named @entity147 was a prime suspect in the case
he was never charged and denied being the @entity10 until his death in 1992
stirring the pot as exciting as @entity11 's account sounds , it may be just a new drop in the bucket
more than 2,500 other people have been considered suspects in the case
investigators said that for decades the phones rang regularly with people wanting to pass on new clues
" we have talked to many people over the years , " @entity162 of the @entity163 said
only two people are believed to have survived @entity10 's attacks
one was @entity167 , who was stabbed eight times in an attack in september 1969
his girlfriend was stabbed between 10 and 20 times
she died , but not before giving a description of her attacker
a sketch of the suspect emerged , and @entity69 says @entity11 's father was a match for it
" if you look at @entity11 's photo next to the sketch of the @entity10 ( killer ) next to his father 's mug shot , you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance , " @entity69 publicist @entity179 told the magazine
" @entity167 told @entity0 on wednesday that he took a look at a head shot of @entity191 that the publisher is circulating
that portrait is part of the new book
" the things that i saw that were not inconsistent were the high forehead , the shock of dark hair , and the fact that he wears glasses , " @entity167 said
@entity167 has his reservations about @entity11 's new account , but says he 's interested in seeing the book
" i somewhat follow the news , but there has been no time in the last 40 - plus years when someone was not ( stirring ) the pot , " @entity167 wrote to @entity0 in an e-mail
who is the @entity10 ? fast facts - serial killers a killer in the family @entity0 's @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .
