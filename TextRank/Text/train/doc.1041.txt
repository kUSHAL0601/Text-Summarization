-- " @entity1 " could have been filmed anywhere , says @entity3 , an independent producer who worked on the film
but there 's a reason producers brought the project to @entity8 : money
" there 's nothing in [ the movie ] that could n't have been shot in any midrange urban setting
the reason , and the sole reason , it was shot in @entity8 was the tax incentives , " he said
@entity8 boasts one of the highest tax credits in the @entity21 : a 20 percent base tax credit , with an additional 10 percent if a @entity8 logo appears somewhere in the project
the @entity33 - nominated " @entity1 " is one of many films that 's taken advantage of the incentives to shoot in the @entity8 , incentives that also include a diverse set of locations , state - of - the - art facilities and large production crews
recently , another production , " @entity34 , " written by @entity35 and @entity36 ( " there 's @entity37 " ) , started filming in the @entity40 area
the film , starring @entity42 and @entity43 , is about a woman who gives her husband permission to have an affair
it called for a @entity50 location -- standard for the brothers , who are from @entity53 -- but tax incentives led the production crew south , producers said
@entity8 is far from the only state offering filmmakers opportunities to leave @entity58
indeed , it 's one of 44 states offering incentives in hopes of attracting projects that will help their economies , according to the @entity66
" no one is trying to compete with @entity68 from a technical standpoint , " @entity3 said
" they 're certainly competing from a financial standpoint , though
the name of the game is all about tax incentives
it 's the sad truth
" films are made in a particular place strictly because of financial rebates , " he continued
" if , tomorrow , @entity68 or ... any state with a crew base , rather , came up with a better incentive program , that 's where the work would be -- overnight
" incentives differ from state to state
in most cases , filmmakers are able to apply for a tax credit or rebate as long as they meet the state 's minimum standards for expenditures and utilize local crews , some of whom do n't belong to unions
however , @entity99 , deputy commissioner at the @entity100 , said bigger production companies usually prefer to work with union workers
@entity68 , one of the first states to develop an incentive program eight years ago , has found exposure in front of the camera with films such as " @entity110 " and " @entity111
" " @entity117 , " set for release in 2011 , is one of many projects whose makers opted to film in @entity68 after the state increased its film production tax credit to 30 percent in 2009 , said @entity119 , director of the @entity120 of @entity100 and tv
but @entity68 does n't just attract projects because of the state 's high tax credit , he said
" no matter how big your incentive is , if someone does n't have a good experience , they 're not going to be back , " he said
@entity130 is what @entity119 calls a repeat customer
@entity133 , vice president of @entity134 at @entity130 , said the company brings a lot of projects to @entity68
it 's the third most popular place the company films , behind @entity141 and @entity142
" so far , we 've had great experiences in the [ @entity145 ] , " @entity133 said
there 's no denying the tremendous impact the film industry has had on each state
hotels , rental cars , restaurants , equipment rentals , local crews , props , wardrobes and local extras are just some of the ways the industry gives back to the area it films in
according to the web site for @entity8 's @entity166 , tv networks , @entity58 studios , production companies and independent producers invested more than $ 521 million in @entity8 in fiscal year 2008 - 09 ; the state estimates the economic impact of this investment at $ 929 million
@entity68 has experienced economic success , as well
its economic development department 's web site says the incentives have generated thousands of jobs and more than $ 2 billion since the program began in 2002
" with some of the bigger movies , [ there are ] hundreds of extras on set , " @entity99 said
" those people all get paid something per day
this is especially a big deal in small towns that have never had a film [ shoot ] there
to spend a few million dollars in a rural area [ makes a big difference ]
" even @entity191 , the home of the business , has gotten into the act
the state recently introduced a 20 percent tax credit , though its incentives are n't as broad as in other states
for example , tv shows to air on basic cable qualify for the credit , whereas shows on broadcast networks do not
@entity133 said the amount of larger movies and tv shows filming in smaller states will continue to rise , which is one reason @entity191 was prompted to create incentives
" they realized their iconic industry was moving elsewhere , " he said
meanwhile , away from @entity58 , the competition is getting stiffer
@entity212 became a major player in the filmmaking business thanks to such productions as the tv show " @entity220 , " which filmed in the coastal city of @entity218 and helped create a thriving film industry there
so when " @entity223 " -- set in @entity218 -- began filming in seaside @entity222 , @entity8 , hard feelings were inevitable
" you ca n't dwell on what you lost ; you have to keep going and move forward , " said @entity224 , director of the @entity225
" it happens all the time , to every state
" legislation to raise the 15 percent tax credit was proposed before " @entity223 " chose not to film in @entity212
the state 's new refund , 25 percent , went into effect january 1
" we 're not trying to [ have ] the highest refund
we 're trying to be the smartest , " @entity224 said
in other words , offer a hefty tax rebate -- and roll camera .
