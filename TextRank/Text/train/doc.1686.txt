-- @entity1 and @entity2 face disciplinary action from @entity6 football 's governing body following wednesday 's fiery @entity8 semifinal between the two @entity10 clubs
@entity11 said on thursday that @entity1 coach @entity12 could be punished for being sent to the stands after @entity14 was sent off , and then making an " inappropriate statement " after his team 's 2 - 0 home first - leg defeat
his club could also be in trouble due to missile - throwing by fans and a pitch invasion at the @entity24 , as well as @entity26 international @entity14 's dismissal for a lunge at @entity2 's @entity28
@entity2 may also be charged at the may 6 hearing -- which comes after tuesday 's second leg in the @entity32 capital -- due to the sending - off of reserve goalkeeper @entity33 during a halftime scuffle between both sets of players
@entity37 : has @entity12 gone too far this time ? @entity2 later said on thursday that the club would report @entity12 to @entity11 for his astonishing tirade , which came despite the @entity6 body delaying the post-match interviews in order to give both teams time to calm down
@entity45 's double saw @entity2 plant one foot in the final , with both goals coming after makeshift midfielder @entity14 was sent off by @entity50 referee @entity49
@entity12 , who was sent to the stands after the red card for his ironic applause at the match officials , suggested that @entity11 shows favoritism towards @entity2
he claimed @entity2 's relationship with world children 's charity @entity57 , and with @entity59 president @entity58 , contributed to their " power " and that the return leg next week was " mission impossible
" @entity2 's official website reported @entity12 as saying : " @entity64 is a fantastic football coach , but he has won one @entity8 which would embarrass me after the scandalous goings on at @entity66 and this year if he wins it again it will be after the scandalous goings on at the @entity68
" i do n't know if it 's the @entity57 publicity or the friendship of @entity58 at @entity11 , where he is vice-president , i do n't know if it 's because they are so nice , but they have got great power
the rest of us have no chance
" @entity45 magic sinks 10 - man @entity1 after an extraordinary meeting of the club 's board of directors , @entity2 spokesman @entity81 said a complaint would be made to @entity11 's disciplinary committee
" we want to defend the history , prestige and reputation of our members , fans , players , coaches and directors , who with their hard work and their effort succeeded in winning the @entity8 in 2009 , " @entity81 said
" it 's unacceptable that someone questions our titles and our links with @entity57
" the build - up to the match had been dominated by a war of words between @entity12 and @entity64
@entity2 's players have been criticized for the pressure they put on the referee during the match but @entity64 refused to be drawn on @entity12 's outburst , telling reporters : " i have nothing to say
" @entity116 - slinging continued between the players , however , with @entity1 striker @entity118 telling @entity10 newspaper as : " whenever you play against @entity2 , whenever you touch them , they are on the floor crying like a baby
" @entity1 also responded on the club 's official website , posting a video that purportedly shows that @entity123 made contact with the ball and not @entity28
@entity1 also claimed that @entity2 players @entity123 and @entity127 overly reacted when challenged by @entity128 and @entity129 during the game
the website published quotes from @entity135 footballers @entity133 and @entity136 condemning @entity28 for diving , along with @entity139 golf star @entity138 and @entity141 player @entity140 -- who also plays soccer .
