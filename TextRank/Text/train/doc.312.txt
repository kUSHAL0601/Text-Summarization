@entity0 -- the largest single aviation purchase in @entity4 's 94 - year history was pulled off today by @entity5
@entity5 who ? if you have never heard of @entity5 , you 're not alone
unless you speak @entity9 and have traveled around the vast array of islands that make up the world 's most populous @entity13 nation , there is no reason why you should have
with @entity17 president @entity16 watching on the sidelines of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) economic summit in @entity21 , @entity5 signed a deal for 230 @entity4 planes totaling $ 21.7 billion , with the first delivery in 2017 -- part of the airline 's plan to buy 408 new planes at $ 37.7 billion , @entity5 ceo @entity29 told @entity1
" from east to west , @entity9 spans 5,000 miles and we have 230 million ( people ) and not enough aircraft to meet the growth of the number of passengers , " @entity29 said
right now , the airline has only a few routes that take it out of @entity9 to @entity40 neighbors @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43
the airline plans to use the new fleet to both expand routes among the 6,000 inhabited islands in @entity9 as well as new routes to @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52
while the developed world has been pummeled with recession , stagnant growth and rising debt burdens in the wake of the @entity59 , developing powerhouses like @entity9 have continued to rise
@entity9 's economic output was $ 706.6 billion in 2010 , up from just $ 95.4 billion in 1998 when the nation was embroiled in the @entity62 , which led to the end of the longtime dictatorship of @entity66 president @entity65
his departure led the way for economic and political reform in the world 's fourth most populous nation
the soaring fortunes of @entity9 echoes the number of @entity66 taking to the skies -- this year , the numbers traveling by air within the country is expected to rise 15 % , the @entity73 said
" as @entity9 's middle class increases in number , more and more people will be traveling throughout the archipelago , " said @entity66 foreign minister @entity80
" and the easiest way to travel is air transport , and so that why i think the projection ahead will be quite promising , and offer many opportunities for many
" for @entity16 , the record deal helped him underline a message he 's echoed during his @entity40 trip : that strong economic ties with @entity93 creates jobs at home
" for the last several days , i 've been talking about how we have to make sure that we 've got a presence in this region , that it can result directly in jobs at home , " @entity16 said in a statement
" and what we see here -- a multibillion - dollar deal between @entity5 -- one of the fastest - growing airlines not just in the region , but in the world -- and @entity4 is going to result in over 100,000 jobs back in the @entity17 , over a long period of time
" when asked why @entity5 chose @entity4 over arch rival , @entity111 - made @entity112 , ceo @entity29 told @entity1 : " there 's not much difference between @entity112 and @entity4
it 's like a person choosing what to eat
you just prefer one dish over another
" executives at @entity4 are no doubt pleased the @entity66 airline prefers to supper in @entity125 rather than dine in @entity111
and as fortunes rise on the archipelago , many more western companies will try to find a place at @entity9 's table
