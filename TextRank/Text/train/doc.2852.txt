@entity0 -- a woman arrested in connection with the splattering of paint in two locations inside the @entity7 in @entity0 was ordered held without bond tuesday
@entity9 , 58 , has been charged with felony destruction of property
when officers arrested her on monday , she had green paint on her clothes and shoes , and paint cans were found in three bags she had with her , according to a police report obtained by @entity1
if found guilty , she could face up to 10 years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine
@entity9 will be kept in custody at least until a second hearing , which is scheduled for friday morning
that hearing will determine whether there is probable cause to continue to hold her
if she is held , she would be entitled to another hearing within 100 days
during her appearance in the @entity27 tuesday , @entity9 wore a white jumpsuit and appeared disheveled with messy hair
early on , while waiting her turn near the front of the courtroom , @entity9 appeared to be smiling
a @entity34 interpreter was brought in to assist her during the proceedings
according to court documents , @entity9 had a visa allowing her to be in the @entity38 that expired on saturday
she traveled on a @entity40 passport
prosecutors argued she was a serious flight risk with no fixed address
" she 's been in the community for only a few days , and the government would argue that there is strong evidence that the defendant 's presence in the district is for no other purpose than to deface national monuments and landmarks , " said prosecutor @entity44
after @entity9 's arrest , @entity55 lodged an immigration detainer against her , meaning that @entity58 wants to be notified before local law enforcement releases her
in other incidents , green paint was used recently to deface the @entity63 , a statue of @entity65 in @entity66 and a statue in front of a @entity70 building , the court documents said
@entity9 was not immediately tied to those events , and her lawyer , @entity72 , argued there is no evidence directly connecting @entity9 to them
her clothes were sent to a forensics team to determine whether the paint on them matches the paint at the other locations
another landmark in @entity0 -- @entity83 -- was also defaced
the court documents allege that a woman matching @entity9 's description was seen at the church sunday
the church is right next to the defaced statue of @entity65
white paint mixed with urine and feces was splattered on the church 's organ
at the cathedral , in @entity0 's northwest quadrant , paint was discovered on an organ console and casework inside the historic @entity100 , in the building 's lower level
a spokesman said the paint was wet when it was discovered
paint was also found in the @entity106 , in the cathedral 's nave
the cathedral is a popular tourist destination
it said that repairs , estimated to cost $ 15,000 , have already begun
five miles south , on the @entity114 , green paint was discovered on a statue outside the @entity116 , known widely as the @entity116
@entity117 , the @entity70 's chief spokeswoman , said the statue is of @entity119 , the first secretary of the federally administered group of museums
@entity1 's @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .
