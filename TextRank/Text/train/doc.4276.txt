@entity0 , @entity1 -- armed men fatally shot a @entity1 police officer and abducted another at a diving resort on the island of @entity8 , according to @entity1 authorities
a group of eight gunmen dressed in army fatigues stormed the @entity13 off the eastern coast of @entity15 on saturday evening and fired on marine police officers guarding the complex , said @entity19 director @entity18
the masked attackers fled by boat with one of the police officers , 26 - year - old constable @entity22 , after a gunfight that killed another , corporal @entity26 , 32
the two policemen were stationed at the resort following a series of kidnappings which began in @entity15 last year
@entity18 said it was unclear who was responsible for the attack , but the vessel was seen traveling toward the southern @entity35 , which is a notorious safe haven for @entity35 separatists
with pristine diving spots that are considered some of the best in the world , @entity15 is a popular destination for tourists but the region remains vulnerable to attacks by insurgents from the southern @entity35
this is the fourth incident involving suspected @entity35 gunmen on the island this year
in april , a @entity49 tourist and a @entity51 worker were kidnapped from a diving resort off @entity53
a month later , a @entity49 fish farm company manager was abducted from @entity55 near @entity56
all three have been released following negotiations with @entity1 and @entity35 security forces
another @entity49 citizen and a @entity1 worker , who were kidnapped from a fish farm near @entity63 on june 23 , remain missing
police believe the gunmen responsible for saturday 's incident avoided detection by rowing a boat to the resort before springing the surprise attack from the rear of the complex , a spokesperson for the @entity1 police , @entity64 , confirmed monday
@entity1 's prime minister @entity76 has expressed his condolences to the family of the officer killed in the ambush , and promised authorities would try their best " to look for and rescue " the missing constable
the @entity13 was operating as usual monday , a spokesperson for the hotel told @entity2
police investigations into the attack are ongoing , @entity18 from the @entity19 said .
