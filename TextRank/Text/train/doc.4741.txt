@entity0 -- president @entity2 hailed steps forward for gay , lesbians and transgendered people on thursday , asserting this community 's fight for rights has reached a " turning point
" " we 've becoming not just more accepting , we 've become more loving as a country and as a people , " he said
" @entity14 and minds change with time ; laws do , too
" his sense of satisfaction and optimism -- voiced at a @entity21 gathering to mark @entity22 -- follows milestone on gay marriage , the inclusion of openly gay @entity27 military service members and boosting health insurance access for same - sex partners
but as the president himself acknowledged , obstacles remain
so , too , do frustrations among some gays and lesbians who have been steadfast @entity2 supporters but had hoped for even more action during his first five years in office
a @entity1 analysis of @entity2 's biggest fundraisers , known as bundlers , during the 2012 election cycle showed that at least 33 -- or about one in every 16 -- was openly gay
together , they raised at least $ 8 million for the campaign between january and the end of march of last year
even with that backing , some have challenged the president over what they see as delays in implementing such promises as an executive order that would ban federal contractors from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
that irritation erupted during a recent @entity57 fundraiser when @entity59 of the gay rights group @entity58 heckled first lady @entity60
" i had planned to speak tonight with @entity57 officials but , as the @entity63 was talking about our children 's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives , i simply could n't stay silent any longer , " @entity59 said in a statement
" i 'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full , honest , and open lives with the stroke of the president 's pen , and i was hoping that the first lady would share my concern for all of our young people , " @entity59 said
disappointment ' @entity2 ' has n't moved quickly enough ' both the president and the nation have evolved on the issue of gay rights
as a presidential candidate in 2008 , @entity2 enjoyed rock star status among the gay and lesbian community
high - profile , openly gay figures such as musician @entity87 and @entity89 mogul @entity88 joined a grassroots army of supporters at campaign rallies
once in the @entity98 , @entity2 's efforts at pressing the case for gay rights were more muted , activists said
some in the community felt betrayed and thought the repeal of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and his evolution on marriage took too long
@entity2 tries to reset with gay community but some saw hope in the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces , @entity2 's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause
administration criticism of a measure in @entity117 last year that banned same - sex marriage and made civil unions illegal and a similar @entity121 proposal also boosted the community 's confidence that @entity2 would help further their cause
" by and large the @entity132 community is quite pleased with what president @entity2 has done , but there is no doubt that some are disappointed that he has n't moved quickly enough on certain issues , " said @entity125 , professor of public policy and political science at @entity128 and @entity129 and author of " from identity to @entity138 : the @entity139 in the @entity27
" @entity2 : ' @entity27 can change ' during his inaugural address this year , the president placed the gay community 's struggle for equality alongside similar civil rights fights by women and african - americans
" our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law , for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal , as well , " @entity2 said in his address after being sworn in
the president and the nation have evolved on same - sex marriage engaging , pushing and chiding the president does n't take away from the appreciation for what the administration has done for the gay rights community , said @entity165 , president of the non-partisan @entity166 to marry organization
the gay rights community will be watching closely to see if @entity2 follows through on a promise to sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity
and , should the @entity27 @entity174 decide gays and lesbian couples have a fundamental constitutional right to wed , the gay rights community will be looking to the @entity2 administration to act quickly to look at federal programs and make sure all couples are treated equally , @entity165 said
" there is enormous support pride and appreciation for the president 's extraordinary leadership and eloquent advocacy in ending discrimination against gay people , " @entity165 said
" the president himself has noted there remains an enormous amount to be done to end legal decimation and gay people and the millions of @entity27 want to see the president do more
" @entity2 said as much , admitting " we 're not done yet " and pointing specifically to a @entity198 bill aimed at sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace
at the same time , he expressed confidence that the movement -- even in a capital oft defined by gridlock -- is in what he feels is a positive direction
" do n't tell me that things ca n't happen when we put our minds to them , " he said
" the genius of @entity27 is that @entity27 can change
" @entity1 's @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .
