-- " @entity1 , we have a bobsled team , " cried the @entity4 film that immortalized an unlikely quartet of @entity6 who became the story of the @entity9
the novelty of four @entity1 swapping their tropical @entity12 homeland for the freezing slopes of @entity14 to become the first team from their country to compete in the bobsleigh was a story that resonated around the world
it also planted a seed in the brain of another @entity1 who , 22 years later , began his quest to ski at the @entity25 in @entity25
now 42 , @entity26 is hoping he 'll be the next pioneer from the @entity28 to blaze a trail in sport -- though perhaps not quite to the same extent as the world 's fastest man @entity32
" i actually watched ' @entity37 ' and the bobsleigh team from 1988 and was inspired , " @entity26 , who refers to himself as " @entity34 , " told @entity0 's @entity36 show
" i just thought it was the coolest thing -- @entity1 in the @entity40 and they did well
" i watched a lot of skiing during those @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 who won two golds in @entity45 ) was the king of the @entity9 and i thought , ' wow , it 's incredible what these guys can do
' " i thought i 'd love to combine the two , represent @entity1 and ski for @entity1 some time in my life
@entity1 is really proud there 's another guy trying to do what the bobsleigh guys did in 1988
" but it was n't until the 2010 installment of the @entity9 in @entity61 that @entity26 , who was born and raised by his @entity63 mother in @entity14 , was spurred on to transform his pipe dream into a reality , as another pair of underdogs took on the establishment
@entity69 , known as the " @entity70 , " was the first person from @entity71 to qualify for the @entity40
he skied in the slalom and made quite an impression with his eccentric outfits
@entity1 @entity75 also made an impact , securing ninth place in the skicross event -- the highest finish ever by a @entity12 athlete at the @entity40
@entity26 was now a man on a mission
" i saw a report on @entity0 with the @entity70 who qualified from @entity71 for the @entity40 in 2010 , " he explained
" i was on my couch and when i saw that , that just put a click in my head and i said , ' if this guy can do it , i can do it
' " i knew we had a @entity92 because i heard about @entity75 , but the @entity70 really inspired me to get off my butt and call them
" there was just one problem : @entity26 had no idea how to ski
he drove straight to an indoor ski slope near his home in @entity100 , @entity101 , and threw himself at the mercy of its resident coach , who quickly realized the scale of his task
" i met one of my instructors , @entity107 , and he took me skiing a couple of times in the indoor hall and said ' you ca n't ski at all , but i like your attitude and i 'll definitely work with you
' " i actually picked up the phone and called @entity75 's mum and said , ' listen , i know your son skis for @entity1 , how did he get in the team ? ' she gave me some tips and the rest is history
" the task facing @entity26 is a tough one
he needs to bring his points average down to 140 by january 2014 to have a shot at qualifying for @entity25 -- it is currently 763
his best finish this season is 43rd out of 45 finishers at an event in @entity133 in @entity134 back in february
in the actual world championships event the following day he was 63rd , but did not qualify for the final race
@entity26 has had many obstacles to overcome , not just in sporting terms , but also with the image of him held by the seasoned professionals on the skiing circuit , who offered him a somewhat frosty reception to begin with
" in the beginning i went to a race , my first race , in a blue ski jacket , black pants , a helmet that was n't regulation , i borrowed the boots from the actual hill where we had the race
i just wanted to try it and i looked like a vacationer going skiing ! " he said
" these guys were just looking at me at the top of the hill going ' what are you doing here ? ' but i did n't care , i just sort of went about my ways , closed my eyes and air planed down the hill and managed to make it
" @entity26 has dedicated his life to fulfilling his dream , training for eight hours a day -- four on the slopes and the rest taken up with work on technique and conditioning
his mum beams with pride whenever he competes on the international stage under the @entity1 flag , so what would it be like if he realized his dream and made it to @entity25 ? " it would be incredible , " he said
" i think the moment you walk into the stadium with all the other athletes and you 're holding up your flag ... to me , it 's incredible
" i 've played a lot of sports in my life -- i 've played professional @entity189 , and i know what it 's like to achieve something in sports , but i think the @entity40 , summer or winter , is the pinnacle of any sporting achievement
" i 'd be really proud , it would be awesome
