@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a remote town in northern @entity1 , a 10 - year - old - boy is struggling with his homework
his name is @entity7 , and the fifth - grader is getting extra help from his father because he 's having trouble adjusting to his new school
the student enrolled at @entity14 in the town of @entity0 is technically a foreigner in his father 's land
@entity18 was born in @entity19 and is a @entity21 citizen
he recites the @entity23 by memory without hesitation
his @entity27 accent is that of a boy raised in the @entity29
@entity18 's family moved back to @entity1 after the state of @entity19 approved some of the toughest immigration laws in the @entity21
now they live in @entity0 , a mining town of 30,000 , about 35 miles south of the @entity21 - @entity1 border
when asked whether it 's been difficult to adjust to life in @entity1 , his answer is " kind of
" pressed to elaborate , he adds that one of his main challenges is having " to speak another language
" opinion : to - do list for @entity45 and @entity1 's new president @entity18 says he misses the abundance of books available to him in @entity21 schools
in @entity1 , textbooks are free , but finding additional reading material is often a challenge , especially in a provincial town that 's a 23 - hour drive from @entity56
@entity18 's 6 - year - old sister , @entity57 , also is an @entity29 citizen
just like her brother , she was born in @entity59 , the second largest city in @entity19 , with a population of just over a half a million people
when asked about the things she misses about the @entity21 , she mentions " the stores , bigger houses and parks
" the children 's parents , @entity18 and @entity69 , lived in @entity19 for 13 years as undocumented immigrants , doing all kinds of odd jobs to survive and provide for their children
they had managed to buy a house and a car when the law , known as @entity77 , was passed in april 2010
the state law originally authorized police to arrest undocumented immigrants without warrant , if there were probable cause to believe that they had committed offenses that could lead to their deportation
it made being in @entity19 without immigration or government identification documents a state crime
and it banned unauthorized immigrants from seeking work
the @entity21 @entity94 struck down those provisions in june but let stand a further clause that allows police to check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws , but by then , the @entity101 had gone
@entity69 , 44 , says they finally made the decision to return to their country to protect their mental sanity
" we would feel persecuted and harassed
it was nerve - wracking , especially when we had to go outside to go to work
" for @entity18 , 41 , the most difficult part was to abandon everything they had worked so long to build
they left their three - bedroom house and sold their @entity117
five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform now they live in a two - bedroom house and drive a @entity123 , an economy @entity125 sedan not sold in the @entity21
" it was difficult , because we had everything there
we had to leave everything behind and return to @entity1
it was difficult , " @entity18 says
@entity7 says they endured years of living in fear in the @entity21 but also hoped they were building a better life for their children
it 's nearly impossible to estimate how many @entity1 immigrants went back home after states like @entity141 and @entity142 also pushed legislation to crack down on illegal immigration , following in @entity19 's footsteps
according to the @entity147 , net migration from @entity1 to the @entity21 fell to zero or less from 2005 to 2010
this means the number of immigrants entering the @entity21 is likely equal or smaller than the number leaving , although , the study adds , some left the @entity21 unwillingly : they were deported
in @entity1 , @entity154 sings her abcs in @entity27 to her family
she has yet to learn them in @entity158
the @entity7 family is among the fortunate ones
@entity18 was able to find a job as a miner just a few months after returning to his hometown in northern @entity1
@entity69 is managing a restaurant , and both kids are enrolled in school
@entity69 has been helping @entity57 with her @entity158 while @entity18 teaches math to his son
both parents say they try not to think about what might have been , while the children frequently seem to miss the life they had across the border
