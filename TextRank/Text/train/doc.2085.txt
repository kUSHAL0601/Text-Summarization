-- in the summer of 1989 , @entity1 debuted its first scripted sitcom , which followed an @entity4 dude ranch owner and the teens he employed for the summer
a lovably goofy concept even then , " @entity7 " ran for 65 episodes and ultimately helped define @entity1 's programming for the next 25 years
it 's since become a cult classic that would find new life on the @entity13 and on dvd , with reruns still getting airtime
cast and crew members of the beloved comedy reunited in honor of the show 's 25th anniversary in @entity23 , @entity24 , for the third annual @entity25
it marked the first time the group had sat down together since the show wrapped filming in 1991
the " @entity7 " gang sat down with both fans and reporters for an afternoon of questions , anecdotes and memories
@entity36 , who portrayed lovable troublemaker @entity37 , said he was taken aback when he saw his cast mates
" it 's so nice to see everybody
it 's just a flood of amazing memories , " he says
" everyone looks great , seems happy
i ca n't believe it 's been so long
" @entity46 , who played bubbly girl - next - door @entity47 , said her kids played in the same gym class as @entity36 's at one point , but it has been difficult to keep in contact with everyone
" some of us did stay in touch , but it was back in the day when we all left , and we did n't have e-mail addresses , " she says
" if you moved and you were n't responsible with your address book , you lost touch
" series writer @entity61 went on to write and produce 1990s @entity1 hits " @entity62 " and " @entity65 , " and opens up about why " @entity7 " remains close to the hearts of everyone involved
" none of us had any experience at all before this , " @entity61 said , " so it 's something we all do remember fondly
" @entity46 said some memories of the show 's aesthetics continue to make her cringe -- especially when it comes to the wardrobe
" i do n't even think that was cool then ! i do n't remember pleated khaki shorts belted with a shirt and a bolero being cool -- even for people who lived on a dude ranch , " she says
but @entity83 , who co-starred as ranch mother figure @entity84 , said she took some of the costumes home after the show wrapped and wears them to this day
the youngest star , @entity7 , got the role of the skateboarding @entity91 after responding to an open call notice in a local @entity94 newspaper
@entity7 lived at home during the show 's filming , but as @entity46 recalls , the rest of the cast were in much closer quarters
" being away from home , we bonded very quickly
we were at the @entity103 , and then we upgraded to the @entity104
" there were two major absences from the reunion : @entity7 , who portrayed strong - minded rich girl @entity108 , and @entity7 , who played the easy - going @entity110
@entity7 had to pull out at the last minute due to a family emergency -- and no one in the group is still in contact with @entity7 or clued in to his whereabouts
" we do n't really know , " @entity61 said
" we just know the same rumors that everybody else knows that reads the @entity13
there was a rumor he died , there was a rumor he was selling cars in @entity126 , but i do n't know if anybody has confirmed any of these things
he 's been hard to find
" @entity46 and @entity7 visited the @entity131 set in @entity94 together a year or two after the show wrapped
although not as run - down as it appears in a recently uploaded fan visit , @entity46 said it was depressing nonetheless
" it was really sad
it was all still standing , but it just all looked decrepit
pieces were taken , everything was stripped down
" the cast members now have children of their own , and have had a variety of experiences introducing " @entity7 " to a new generation
" a few years ago , somebody contacted me and said they 're rerunning all the episodes , so @entity148 'd them for my children , " says @entity36
" my oldest , who was probably like 8 at the time , really loved it
she totally was into it ! " it was n't quite the same positive reaction for @entity158 , who joined the show as series regular @entity161 in @entity162
" i bought the dvds and showed them to my children , but their eyes glazed over , " recalls @entity158
" they did not think it was funny
" the cast and crew are mostly in agreement a reboot of the series does n't sound like a good idea , with or without the original characters
for @entity46 , " @entity7 " worked so well in part because of the time it aired
" nowadays , a reboot would be so different
there 's something very simple about the show , " she says
" it was just these kids on a dude ranch navigating their way through these simple issues
i do n't think it would be cool to see @entity108 and @entity47 texting each other or @entity189 - ing each other ! " show writer @entity191 says " @entity7 " is still the most asked - about credit on her @entity193 Â© , despite later work on critical favorites like " @entity196 " and " sisters
" " i 've actually had people come up to me over the last few years ... and say things like , ' you shaped my childhood
' it 's an amazing thing to hear ! " of all the times people have recognized her from the show , @entity46 said , one instance stands out
" the year i was marrying my husband [ actor / director @entity207 ] , we 're at a party , and this sort of @entity211 , blonde type comes up to me and says , ' oh my god ! @entity47 from " @entity7 "
' and i said , ' @entity212 , you know " hey dude " ? ' and she said , ' yeah
' and that was the first time i met @entity214
" hey , dude , see more comedy biz stories at @entity218 .
