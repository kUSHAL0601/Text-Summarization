-- the milestones keep coming for @entity2 , but the tennis superstar had to dig deep at the @entity4 on sunday before notching his 900th career win and reaching his 36th successive grand slam quarterfinal
@entity2 made a flying start against home hope @entity8 , but then lost the next two sets to raise the prospect of his earliest defeat at a major tournament since he lost in the third round at @entity4 to @entity15 in 2004
an uncharacteristic fall on the red clay by the @entity18 in the seventh game of the second set heralded a change of momentum
however , he regained his composure to triumph 6 - 1 4 - 6 2 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 3 and earn a clash with another @entity25 , sixth seed @entity26
" it was a great atmosphere in which to play like this
it became difficult in the second set as @entity8 turned it around , " said the 17 - time grand slam champion , who has lost only once in 23 times he has had to play five sets
" i am proud of the record
it 's a lot of years , a lot of sacrifices and a lot of matches like this
" @entity8 had won five - set matches in the first and third rounds , but was unable to reach the second grand slam quarterfinal of his career -- the only one being in @entity45 in 2009
@entity2 , whose only @entity4 triumph was in 2009 , became the fourth player to reach 900 wins -- @entity49 was the last to do so in 1990
the 31 - year - old @entity18 has won 81.5 % of those matches , with just 204 defeats
he has a 9 - 3 career record against @entity26 , who beat @entity57 's @entity56 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 3 to reach the quarterfinals of his home event for the second successive year
interactive : the secrets of @entity4 champions @entity25 has not had a male champion since @entity64 in 1983 , and @entity26 is looking to make up for last year 's heartbreak -- when he blew four match - points in a five - set defeat by world no. 1 @entity68
" i 'm playing well , so all the lights are green , " the 28 - year - old said
i have nothing to lose
" fourth seed @entity73 will take on this year 's surprise package @entity76 in an all - @entity78 quarterfinal
@entity76 became the first man in 86 years to come back from two sets down in three successive matches in a grand slam as he defeated 11th - seeded compatriot @entity83 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 4
the 31 - year - old , who this time last year had dropped from a career - high fifth in the rankings to a lowly 470th after 14 months out with injury , trailed 4 - 1 in the third set before launching an another incredible comeback
" maybe he had a little bit of doubt , though , in that moment , " said 34th - ranked @entity76 , who also reached the last eight in @entity92 in 2003 , 2005 and 2009
" then i just pushed hard and i won the third
and then i was just dreaming and dreaming to try to do it again , and i did it
" @entity83 , who has reached two finals on the @entity98 this year , also led 4 - 2 in the fourth set and 2 - 0 in the decider
" i had my ups and downs
these ups and downs cost me the match , " said the 27 - year - old , who also blew a two - set lead against @entity73 in january 's @entity106 quarterfinals
" i think @entity110 produced a remarkable , admirable game
i have every respect for what he did
for my part , i need to move on as best i can
" @entity73 , a semifinalist last year , dropped just five games as he crushed @entity118 23rd seed @entity119 6 - 3 6 - 1 6 - 1
" i 'm very happy with my game today , " said @entity73 , who has not lost a set in four matches
" maybe i played the best match of this week
