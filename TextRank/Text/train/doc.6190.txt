-- the @entity1 and the @entity2 are investigating possible civil rights violations in the case of a sheriff 's deputy who was captured on video beating a handcuffed inmate with a baton
the @entity11 's deputy was fired after an august 5 surveillance video showed him hitting the inmate dozens of times with a baton , authorities said monday
the video shows the deputy leading the handcuffed man from a van toward the jail
the deputy then pulls out his baton and begins swinging it repeatedly at the man 's legs , bashing him until he falls to the ground
once the man is on the ground , the deputy continues to hit him as at least two other deputies look on
the deputy helps the man up at one point only to slam his face against the hood of the van , the video footage shows
the man was hit 27 times , @entity0 - affiliate @entity34 reported
the beating broke the man 's left leg just above the ankle and put a gash in the man 's other leg that required stitches , the affiliate reported
the state police agency released a statement from @entity11 sheriff @entity47
" as soon as we were made aware of this situation , we contacted sled and requested that they investigate
this employee has been terminated , " @entity51 said in the statement
the inmate was identified as @entity55 , and he was arrested on charges of open container , possession of marijuana , a suspended license and giving false information to police , the affiliate reported
the deputy said he was angered because @entity64 had threatened him and his family when he was driving the man to the jail , the affiliate reported
two other police brutality cases under investigation by the state police agency and the @entity1 , but not related are : -- the july arrest of a @entity73 police officer accused of assaulting a suspect during a traffic stop
the @entity76 has fired the officer
-- the july arrest of two @entity80 correctional officers accused of assaulting a juvenile arrestee
both of the employees have been fired
civil rights investigations also include whether law enforcement officers who were present were required to render aid , @entity84 said in a news conference tuesday
" we do n't think it is typical behavior in @entity92 , but it 's disturbing behavior , " @entity84 said
he added that standard police training does not include the method shown in the video
" you probably should n't be hitting anybody with a ... baton while they 're handcuffed
" " my personal reaction was like any other person who viewed it , " he said , adding that the deputy is presumed innocent
" but you ca n't watch the video without having some serious concern for what went wrong there
" @entity84 noted that " these allegations do not reflect the professional work of thousands of @entity92 law enforcement officers each and every day
all subjects of these investigations are presumed innocent of these charges at this time
