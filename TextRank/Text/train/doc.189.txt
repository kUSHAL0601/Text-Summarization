-- @entity1 , a left - leaning @entity2 politician who promises reforms in education and services to the poor , was sworn in as the nation 's president thursday
in his first address as president , @entity1 stressed equality , saying he wants @entity2 to be " a place where everyone enjoys the same rights to abundance and happiness
" " economic growth and social inclusion must march together , " he said of his governing philosophy
he succeeds @entity20 , who oversaw a period of robust economic growth as president , but who nonetheless was unpopular and criticized for promoting business at the expense of indigenous groups and the environment
@entity1 , an ex-army officer who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2006 as a leftist ally of @entity32 's @entity31 , reinvented himself as a more moderate leader
he calmed markets and worries that his moderation was a facade to win the election by naming a @entity38 made up of political moderates
the new president has promised to spread the benefits of @entity2 's economic boom to the poor
he has cited needs to improve the nation 's infrastructure , water , sanitation and education , particularly in rural areas
a number of presidents from other @entity54 countries , including @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , were on hand to witness the swearing - in ceremony
there was a small oddity during the swearing in of @entity1 and his two vice presidents , when they all swore allegiance to @entity2 's 1979 @entity65
that document , however , was replaced in 1993 by a new one drafted during the presidency of strongman @entity69
@entity1 defeated @entity69 's daughter , @entity70 , to win the presidency
the slap at the current @entity65 resulted in boos and shouts from members of @entity69 's party
several times in his speech , @entity1 talked about the importance of unity
" reality requires a new social contract that makes it possible for all @entity2 to live together , " he said
he added that he wants " to be seen as a defender of human rights and of @entity86 and expression
" other leftist leaders in @entity54 , such as @entity55 president @entity89 and @entity32 's @entity31 , have been criticized by press freedom organizations for clamping down on the media
@entity1 promised change , but warned that it would not be as swift as his critics fear , or as some of his supporters desire
to be lasting , he said , " any changes must be gradual and rational
" in another minor controversy , the outgoing president , @entity20 , did not attend the swearing - in ceremony to pass the presidential sash to his successor
@entity20 , who was also president in a disastrous term from 1985 to 1990 , was booed and heckled by @entity104 when he bid farewell
according to local media , he decided not to attend this time to avoid another round of heckling .
