-- the national debt is bad for the military , @entity2 chairman adm. @entity1 is telling business men and women and others on a three - day " conversations with the @entity11 " tour across the @entity10
@entity1 's trip , which ends friday in @entity13 , @entity14 , is aimed at encouraging business owners to hire veterans
" the most significant threat to our national security is our debt , " he told @entity0 wednesday
" and the reason i say that is because the ability for our country to resource our military -- and i have a pretty good feeling and understanding about what our national security requirements are -- is going to be directly proportional -- over time , not next year or the year after , but over time -- to help our economy
" that 's why it 's so important that the economy move in the right direction , because the strength and the support and the resources that our military uses are directly related to the health of our economy over time
" the wars on @entity43 and @entity44 have contributed to a more than doubling of the @entity46 budget , which has jumped from $ 300 billion to $ 664 billion since 2000
defense secretary @entity47 has called on his department to find $ 100 billion in overhead savings over the next five years
speaking thursday to the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity1 agreed that the @entity46 needs to " cut the fat
" " we 're not a business , " he said in @entity51
" part of us does this really well
parts of us have never had to , plus our budget has doubled over the last 10 years
" the admiral said the @entity46 has not been as proactive as it should have been in prioritizing spending and said the department must adopt responsible fiscal practices
" a lot of those skills have to be sharpened , " @entity1 said
both industry and the military need to hone those skills , he said , to avoid " this wave of debt
" " it 's the responsibility of both sides , " he said
" we have to gird ourselves for some pretty significant challenges , given the national security challenges that we have as well as the responsibility to steward every dollar that we have
" @entity1 has been telling his audiences that interest on the debt will nearly equal the defense budget in two years , but @entity83 numbers , in a report released in january , show the interest payment approaching the @entity46 's 2000 budget in 2012 and reaching its 2010 budget in 2019 .
