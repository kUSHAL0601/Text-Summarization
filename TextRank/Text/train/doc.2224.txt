-- the @entity2 has captured seven suspected pirates in the @entity4 , the first arrests by a @entity7 - led task force set up to curb rampant piracy off the @entity9 , a @entity2 spokesman said wednesday
seven men suspected of trying to pirate a tanker raise their hands before their arrest in the @entity4
sailors from the cruiser @entity15 arrested the men wednesday in the western @entity4 -- a waterway between @entity18 and the @entity19 -- after a distress call from the 420 - foot ( 128 - meter ) tanker @entity22
the tanker reported that men aboard a small skiff were attempting to board the ship using ladders , but its crew removed them before the would - be hijackers could get aboard , the @entity2 said
the @entity15 found and boarded the skiff , and the tanker 's crew identified the men aboard the skiff as their would - be hijackers
the skiff 's men were taken aboard the @entity15 , the flagship of the task force now patrolling the western @entity4 , and eventually will be transferred to @entity36 for trial , said lt. @entity38 , a spokesman for the @entity7 @entity39
piracy has become a chronic problem off the @entity9 in recent years , with some pirates operating from largely lawless @entity43
pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of @entity43 in 2008 , according to the @entity48
the task force led by the @entity15 was set up in january in an effort to clamp down on the attacks in the region , the southern approach to the @entity54 and the @entity55 .
