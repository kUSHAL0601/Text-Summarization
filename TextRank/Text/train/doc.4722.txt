@entity1 aircraft have concluded a third round of strikes against an @entity8 cell inside @entity9 , two @entity1 officials with direct knowledge of the just - completed mission told @entity10 on thursday
the officials said it was a small number of strikes and that the targets included at least one top operative of what 's known as the @entity15
the sources would not say who was targeted
they said it is too early to have an assessment of the strikes ' results
@entity22 is a group of hard - core @entity8 operatives , many of whom moved to @entity9 from @entity27 in the last few years
the @entity1 government has expressed concern about the group 's ability to make bombs that can get past security screening in airports and elsewhere
it targeted the @entity15 with a series of strikes in @entity9 in september
those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the @entity1 homeland , as well as other @entity45 targets , a senior @entity1 official told @entity10 at the time
the group has " suffered " setbacks as a result of the strikes , which have killed a number of fighters and forced it to spread out , one law enforcement official who has seen the intelligence assessments said thursday
another @entity1 official said " some have been killed
they 're being hunted down and they have to think about what they do and that 's disruptive
" at the same time , some of the @entity22 leadership is still believed to be alive and the group continues to pose a threat , according to the officials , who say some are still in @entity9 , actively plotting against the @entity1 .
