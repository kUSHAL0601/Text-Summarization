@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been nearly a week since a truce between the @entity1 government and rebel groups took effect in @entity0 , and as opposition fighters have left the @entity11 area of the city , thousands of displaced residents have come back
the streets of the district are packed with people carrying belongings out of the district or moving possessions in to return to their homes
the people are usually busy and rarely joke or smile , but in the middle of this scene there was a tiny , thin and frail - looking woman who stood out
her name is @entity27 and a group of people had gathered around her , hugging and kissing her , almost crying with joy
@entity27 is one of fewer than 30 civilians known to have lived through the entire siege of @entity0 -- more than two years of constant shelling , sniper fire and starvation
" i am 49 years old and i weigh only 34 kilos ( about 75 pounds ) , " @entity27 told me when i met her at a damaged church in @entity38
" the shelling was terrible , it was going on almost all the time
i got wounded on my arm and my shoulder once
" @entity27 survived the siege with her brother @entity45
they remained in a little apartment , hoping it would n't be flattened by an artillery shell , or that @entity51 rebels would not kill the two @entity52 , as @entity52 are often perceived by the opposition to support the regime of president @entity55
" they often accused me of supporting the government , " @entity56 said , sitting in the apartment with his sister @entity27
" i told them -- who am i supposed to support when i am stuck in here ? i am not supporting anyone
" @entity45 and @entity27 devoted all of their energy to staying alive
@entity45 ventured out into the dangerous streets almost every day , looking for material to burn in the little stove they have in the apartment
" i only got the wood that the rebels left behind after they cut down the trees
i also never burned any furniture , all i used were broken window frames and doors after they were blown out by the shelling
" the windows in the little apartment the brother and sister occupied were quickly blown out as well , leaving them cold on top of being hungry and scared of the war that was being fought around them
rebels captured the old town of @entity0 in 2011
the @entity1 military later started a massive push to win the territory back using heavy weapons including artillery in the urban area
then government forces encircled the rebels and laid siege to the district , preventing food and medical supplies from getting in
the @entity102 accuses the @entity55 regime of using starvation as a weapon in the civil war
the @entity107 says both sides are guilty of keeping supplies from reaching besieged places , but that the government 's use of starvation is more widespread
@entity27 and @entity45 soon found their supplies running out as the siege raged on
" in the beginning we had some canned foods , but those quickly ran out , " @entity45 said
" then the rebels came and raided our apartment
they took a lot of the dry foods we had left like flour , bulgur and rice
they came more than 30 times and broke in and held guns to our face
it is an awful feeling to be sleeping at night and then to wake up with a gun to your head
" when the last of the food was gone , @entity45 was forced to go out and search for grass and leaves to eat
he found the leaves that saved their lives on a tree in a graveyard , of all places
" they taste the best
the other ones were very bitter , " he said
" we ate them for breakfast , dinner and for lunch every day
" @entity27 showed me a tiny bowl , which was the serving size they allowed themselves for each meal
" we cut them up and made a stew with them for lunch , " she said
" in the mornings we would eat them fresh with some oil we had left , and in the evenings we tried to fry them on the stove if we had wood
these leaves saved our lives
" the brother and sister say it was also their faith that helped them through the two years of confinement , violence and hunger
" there were some nights that we were just sad , " @entity45 said
" when you just think that you have not seen your family in such a long time , that you might never see them again and that you have no idea when you will be able to get out of here
in those times , sometimes we just cried
" but in the end they made it through more than 700 days of the siege of @entity38
@entity27 is still weak and can not stand for an extended period of time
she spends most of the time on the couch in the apartment reading books or resting
@entity45 is stronger , but his clothes look baggy on him after he lost so much weight due to the starvation
but both @entity45 and @entity27 are survivors
they say the hardship they have endured might have made them thin and frail , but it has made their spirits stronger than ever , and they are looking to the future with optimism .
