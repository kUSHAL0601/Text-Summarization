@entity0 -- a @entity3 spokesman expressed hope wednesday that only a temporary " technical issue " led the @entity6 government to deny permission for @entity9 's energy minister to fly to the autonomous @entity11 region in northern @entity10
energy minister @entity14 's plane was forced to turn around in mid-flight tuesday
he was in a private plane flying to @entity17 , the @entity10 's capital , to attend a three - day conference on oil and gas
" we had applied for flight permits
we were issued one , and the plane was on the move , " said a @entity9 foreign ministry official , speaking on condition of anonymity due to government protocol
" but in the meantime we were notified by the @entity6 that they have banned all vip flights to @entity10
" but @entity3 spokesman @entity32 told @entity1 on wednesday that officials there hope the denial was only temporary
" there are new regulations by the central government for private planes to enter @entity6 airspace , and apparently energy minister 's plane had not complied with the new regulations " @entity32 said
" @entity6 airspaces are completely controlled by the central government
the cabin crew of the @entity9 minister 's plane was directly in touch with @entity51 to get permission and @entity3 has no control on it " he added
" we hope it is only a technical issue and it will be resolved soon , " he said
opinion : why @entity57 should rethink policy over @entity59 's @entity11 @entity6 government officials have not commented on the aborted flight
the incident came at a time of heightened tension between @entity65 and @entity51
@entity9 prime minister @entity66 and his @entity6 counterpart , @entity67 , have engaged in a public war of words , accusing each other of pushing their respective countries towards civil war
for months , @entity9 has also offered sanctuary to @entity10 's fugitive vice president , @entity74 , who was sentenced to death in absentia by an @entity6 court for murder
and last august , the @entity6 central government loudly objected after @entity9 's foreign minister made a short visit from @entity10 to the contested oil - rich city of @entity84 , apparently without @entity51 's permission
@entity6 @entity11 have witnessed a remarkable reversal over the past decade , as @entity9 has gone from being a major adversary to being one of the @entity3 's largest trading partners
" to ensure access to @entity11 oil and gas , @entity9 has eased its trade , economic , diplomatic relations with the @entity3
even in some cases , it has acted as the protector of the @entity11 in @entity10 , " wrote @entity95 , an @entity6 @entity11 energy security analyst at @entity97
" this has made both @entity51 and @entity107 angry , and they have been trying to limit @entity9 influence , " @entity95 added , referring to @entity100 , another regional player that is seen by many observers as one of the chief patrons of the @entity51 government
the intrigues in @entity10 have been complicated by the fact that relations are also deteriorating between @entity67 's government and the @entity10
the @entity6 central government and the @entity3 have been at odds for years over who has final authority over @entity10 's vast oil wealth
in recent weeks , that tension has flared around @entity84
last month , @entity6 @entity10 deployed troops and tanks to cement the @entity11 ' claim over the strategic city
the @entity11 forces have been engaged in a tense standoff with units of the @entity127 , which were recently deployed to areas near @entity84
@entity129 : ' do n't even think about attacking @entity9 '
