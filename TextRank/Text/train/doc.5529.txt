-- in anger over the recent death of an internet activist who faced federal charges , hackers claiming to be from the group @entity6 threatened early saturday to release sensitive information about the @entity9 @entity8
they claimed to have one such file on multiple servers ready for immediate release
the hackers hijacked the website of the @entity9 government agency responsible for federal sentencing guidelines , where they posted a message demanding the @entity9 reform its justice system or face incriminating leaks to select news outlets
the lengthy , eloquently written letter was signed " @entity6
" @entity24 , executive assistant director of the @entity26 's @entity25 , and @entity27 , said the bureau was immediately aware of the threat and is " handling it as a criminal investigation
" " we are always concerned when someone illegally accesses another person ( 's ) or government agency 's network , " he said
the @entity36 said its website was brought down " temporarily " before it was restored later saturday
" the commission 's publications , training materials and federal sentencing statistics are again readily accessible to visitors to the site , " it said in a statement
the suicide of internet activist @entity47 on january 11 triggered the posting of the hackers ' message to the web address of the sentencing commission , they said
his death , which they blamed on the justice system , " crossed a line , " the letter said
how @entity47 helped build the internet a @entity61 video accompanied the message , and made use of images from @entity66 nuclear scenarios and games of strategy
the letter contained nuclear metaphors to refer to chunks of embarrassing information
the hackers said they have obtained " enough fissile material for multiple warheads , " which it would launch against the @entity8 and " its associated executive branches
" it gave the " warheads " the names of @entity9 @entity81 justices
' @entity6 ' threatens @entity82 @entity6 accused the @entity26 of infiltrating its ranks and claimed the federal government is applying " highly disproportionate sentencing " to ruin the lives of some of its members
@entity47 , 26 , was facing federal computer fraud charges and could have served 35 years in prison
@entity6 said he " was killed , " because he " faced an impossible choice
" his family has issued a statement saying that federal charges filed over allegations that he stole millions of online documents contributed to @entity47 's decision to take his own life
the files were mostly scholarly papers from the @entity103
opinion : why the @entity105 grieves @entity47 @entity47 's suicide has inspired a flurry of online tributes and mobilized @entity6 , the loosely defined collective of so - called " hacktivists " who oppose attempts to limit @entity114 freedoms
both @entity47 and @entity6 have been stark proponents of open access to information and open - source programming
a review of a cached version of the @entity122 website showed the @entity6 message on its homepage early saturday
@entity6 also posted an editable version of the website , inviting users to deface it as they pleased
multiple pages -- not only the home page -- appeared to allow users to alter them
the " warhead " names appeared as links , most leading to 404 error messages of pages not found , but some leading to pages of raw programming code
the hackers said they chose the commission 's website because of its influence on the doling out of sentences they consider to be unfair
@entity0 's @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 contributed to this report
