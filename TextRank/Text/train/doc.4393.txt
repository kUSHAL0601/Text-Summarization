-- the uncle of a @entity3 motorcyclist pulled from underneath a burning car by a group of bystanders told his nephew 's rescuers they are " heroes to our family
" @entity11 spoke to @entity0 's @entity12 one day after a group of construction workers , students and other bystanders turned into a ragtag team of first responders to save @entity19 , 21
the accident happened monday on a street near @entity22 in @entity23 and was captured on video
" i thank you on behalf of my family , and i know that my nephew @entity28 will hope to thank you at some point , too
i know that you might be shy and want to dislodge the title , but you are heroes to our family , " @entity11 said , adding that his nephew is in good spirits
" he was talking to us earlier and going through physical therapy and felt good after that
things could have been much worse
" sgt. @entity36 of the @entity23 police was the first officer on the scene
he was about to motion to a fellow responding officer to grab a jack when , " i realized that these citizens had already organized and were just going to manually lift ( the car ) up
" the crash occurred when a @entity46 pulled out of a parking lot and in front of the motorcyclist
@entity50 , assistant chief of @entity23 police , said the motorcyclist tried to avoid the car , which resulted in him laying the motorcycle down
after crashing , gas spilled out of the motorcycle and ignited , engulfing both the motorcycle and the front end of the car in flames , @entity50 said
the motorcyclist became lodged underneath the burning vehicle
the video , shot by @entity63 , shows several startled bystanders looking under the @entity46 as flames leap into the air
the crowd quickly grows to include a man in a suit , construction workers wearing hard hats , a woman in sandals and a young man carrying a backpack , the video shows
after one person in the group tries to pick up the blazing car , the crowd joins in and lifts the 4,000 - pound vehicle
" i do remember one gentleman saying , ' we need everybody to come and help lift , ' and that 's when everybody ran over , " @entity82 recalled
one of the bystanders drags the fallen motorcyclist from under the vehicle , the video shows
@entity19 was rushed to a hospital and was in stable condition after surgery monday evening , @entity50 said
the driver of the car was not seriously injured
the man @entity50 believes to be the driver appears in the video dressed in a dark suit
he stood a little off to the side from the group and did not help lift the car , the video shows
after @entity19 is pulled from underneath the vehicle , the man in the suit walks over to look at the motorcyclist
" he was in a shock , " @entity50 said about the driver , adding that any possible charges related to the traffic accident are pending
" it was frightening , " said @entity63 , who shot the scene from the ninth floor of a nearby building
" you do n't really see something like that and then when you do , it 's inspiring
it gives us hope , " he told @entity127 's " @entity126
" police are looking for the good samaritans to recognize them at a city council meeting for their actions
most have already been identified , @entity50 said
three of them , all @entity22 students , spoke to @entity0 tuesday
@entity134 said he tried not to think of the danger as he jumped in to help
" at first , when i saw it was a fire , i did n't think about myself , " said @entity134 " i thought about this poor guy underneath the car , and i thought the car was going to explode
" another student , @entity148 said , " all that came to my mind was if it was my son or my kid brother or anybody that is known to me , the first thing i would have done was to help that person
so all i did was quickly rush and give a helping hand
" @entity151 said he did not think he or the others who helped were heroes
" we are just human beings trying to help another human being
it is like our human instinct , " he said
but police believe the bystanders are heroes
" @entity160 of those people put their lives in danger as they do what they can to rescue @entity28 , " @entity50 told " @entity126
" the area where @entity19 crashed is highly trafficked , @entity82 said
" i think had this accident happened in a suburban area we would n't have gotten that kind of response -- we would have never had that kind of manpower , " he said
@entity82 added : " it speaks volumes to what people will do in a tragic situation to help another person out
