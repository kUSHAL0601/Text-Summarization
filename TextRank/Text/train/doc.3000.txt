-- @entity1 , whose straight - arrow demeanor helped restore many @entity4 ' trust in government during his two terms as governor in the 1970s , died thursday
he had been admitted saturday with pneumonia to @entity11 , where he then suffered a stroke , former aide and family spokesman @entity8 told @entity0
" he was mr. integrity , " said @entity13 , a journalist at @entity14 who has been covering @entity16 since 1974
" governor @entity1 pushed us into the 20th century
" as governor from 1971 to 1979 , @entity1 secured legislative approval to levy corporate income tax , repealed consumer taxes on household utilities and apartment rentals and doubled homestead exemption amounts
he also pushed through a law requiring public officials to disclose their income sources
" everyone called him the guy with the white hat , " @entity13 said
@entity1 was unafraid to roll up his sleeves and pitch in
@entity13 recalled stopping in at the building where , in the 1970s , the " @entity35 " initiative campaign on income disclosure was being spearheaded
" he was sitting there counting and organizing petitions by county , so they could be turned in , " @entity13 said
@entity1 's terms coincided with a time of upheaval in government at a national level and in @entity47 , where three state @entity49 justices and three cabinet officers had resigned amid scandal
" he governed at the height of @entity54 , when there was huge mistrust , " @entity13 said
" he was the man who gave people confidence that @entity47 government would run honestly and fairly for everyone
" that passion for equality explained his fervent opposition to segregation , which he expressed through support for busing
" he felt that busing was a necessity so that people could have equal education , " @entity13 said
in 1972 , he confronted then - @entity72 presidential candidate @entity71 , who was campaigning in @entity47 on the busing issue
" @entity1 took him on directly , and went to the people , " said historian @entity74 , who met @entity1 in 1978 , wrote about his political career and considered him a friend
@entity1 had been advised not to jeopardize his political future by getting involved in that battle , but he did not heed the advice
@entity1 believed that the fight to end segregation in the state " was about the soul and the future of @entity47 , " according to @entity74 , who wrote " from yellow dog democrats to @entity87 " ( 2013 , @entity88 ) and serves as director of the @entity90 at the @entity91
though @entity1 lost on the busing issue , he proposed a second referendum on providing quality schools for all @entity47 children , which won
years later , @entity1 recalled his handling of busing in a conversation with @entity99
" i think probably the thing that he said that struck me the most was , ' i felt my job was to help people overcome their fears , ' " @entity74 recalled
the question of how @entity47 would balance aggressive growth and stewardship of the environment was another challenge facing the governor , who assumed office after a decade in which the state 's population grew by 2.2 million people , according to @entity74
so @entity1 brought together 150 state leaders and asked them to consider the direction the state should take , the historian said
the outcome : passage of the @entity123 , the @entity124 , the @entity125 and the establishment of the division of state planning
he also muscled through a $ 200 million bond to buy environmentally sensitive land for conservation and parks
as he sought to persuade conservative leaders to sign on to an effort that placed some restrictions on growth , @entity1 's political prowess rose to the fore
" he understood how the process worked , and he tried to work through the leadership , " buttonholing his adversaries and inviting them into the governor 's limo , where he would hold them hostage in the back seat and regale them " until they said they 'd listen or agree , or he 'd agree to make some changes so he could get their support
" " when you look at his integrity , belief and support for open government , his commitment to the opportunities for people of all ethnicities and races and backgrounds , his leadership on the environment -- it 's an incredible record
" @entity1 's rectitude extended to his personal life , too
he neither smoked nor drank and did not allow alcohol into the governor 's mansion , @entity13 said
that restriction is widely believed to be the reason that then - vice president @entity175 changed his plans at the last minute to overnight at the mansion during a visit to @entity16 in the early 1970s
security concerns were cited as the official reason
@entity1 was born on september 11 , 1928 , in @entity181 , @entity182
he enlisted in the @entity184 paratroopers in 1946 and was discharged as a sergeant in 1948
he graduated from @entity186 in @entity16 , where he was student body president ; then from the @entity187 , where he was class president
he served as second lieutenant in the @entity190 from 1951 to 1953 and began his public career in 1956 as assistant county solicitor for @entity193
in 1958 , he served in the @entity194 , moving four years later to the @entity195 , where he served as president pro tempore from 1969 to 1970
elected governor in 1970 , he became the first governor in the state 's history to be elected to a second , successive four - year term
in 1956 , he married @entity202 ; they had two children
after he left office , @entity1 went on to teach at all 10 of the state 's major public universities , most recently at @entity186 's @entity208
though @entity1 was a @entity209 , " he was not a @entity209 , " said @entity13 , who went on to become friends with the former governor
" the @entity72 were really moderate @entity212 in today 's world
" he was a tough taskmaster , according to @entity13 , who took a master 's - level class from the retired politician
" he would lecture on a different federal and state case every week for an hour and a half , and then the final was just brutal -- it was a 2Â½ - hour , handwritten , pencil - and - paper , no - notes final in which he expected you to tell him everything he 'd told you
" people we 've lost in 2014 @entity0 's @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report
