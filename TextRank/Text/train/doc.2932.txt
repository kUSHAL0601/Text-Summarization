-- it was @entity3 's first league defeat this season -- and the @entity8 club 's first in 54 @entity6 games
it even came against one of the team 's @entity12 rivals
but coach @entity14 is already looking ahead to a bigger prize
with the domestic title wrapped up in record time , the @entity16 rang the changes for saturday 's match against @entity20 as he introduced three teenage debutants
it backfired spectacularly , as an error by young defender @entity24 handed striker @entity25 a first - half goal that ultimately settled the match for the eighth - placed home side -- beaten 2 - 0 by @entity3 in the @entity29 in december
but for @entity14 , the main thing was his squad escaped unscathed ahead of wednesday 's @entity33 quarterfinal second leg against @entity35 , which he described as " a matter of life or death
" the defending champions will be without suspended midfielders @entity42 and @entity43 following the midweek 1 - 1 draw at @entity45
" we fought hard and tried different approaches
you ca n't always win
a defeat was on the cards sooner or later , " @entity14 said
" we accept that and we need to prepare as soon as possible for the game against @entity35
we did n't lose because of the younger players
@entity54 and @entity24 were the best players on the pitch
" they 've trained with us a lot , they know how we play and also know what i want
hats off to the three of them
we 're in a final on wednesday
it 's a matter of life and death
" goalkeeper @entity69 emphasized the importance of the upcoming @entity72 match
his team 's only defeat this campaign came in the group stage against @entity77 , with qualification already assured
" the main thing for us was that nobody got injured today
that 's the crucial point , " he said
" it 's all about wednesday and the match against @entity35
" @entity3 's defeat meant second - placed @entity88 closed the gap to 20 points with a 2 - 1 win at home to @entity93
@entity95 striker @entity94 , who missed @entity88 's 3 - 0 @entity33 defeat at @entity97 in midweek due to suspension , celebrated his return with the equalizing goal after @entity102 's opener
@entity103 netted a 77th - minute winner
third - placed @entity105 could only draw 1 - 1 at @entity106 , while @entity107 moved above @entity108 into fourth on goal difference with a 2 - 0 win at second - bottom @entity111 .
