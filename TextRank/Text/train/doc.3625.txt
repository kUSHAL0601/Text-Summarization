-- the arrest and strip - search of @entity4 diplomat @entity3 , accused of visa fraud , has sparked questions about the complex , murky system of diplomatic immunity
" there 's a lot of subjectivity on this stuff , " says @entity0 legal analyst @entity10
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity16 , says his client is entitled to diplomatic immunity and ca n't be prosecuted under @entity19 law , @entity0 's @entity4 sister network @entity15 reported
but the @entity20 says @entity3 's consular immunity does not cover this kind of crime
now , @entity3 has been moved to @entity4 's @entity24 to the @entity25 -- where , @entity4 officials say , she may get full diplomatic immunity
the rules involved are laid out by the @entity20 in a guidance document for law enforcement and judicial authorities
" most of these privileges and immunities are not absolute , and law enforcement officers retain their fundamental responsibility to protect and police the orderly conduct of persons in the @entity19 , " the document states
members of consular posts , such as @entity3 at the time of her arrest , do not have the same level of immunity as those who work at diplomatic missions
consular officers have some immunity involving official acts , but their " personal inviolability " is " quite limited , " the document says
they may be arrested and detained for alleged felonies , and may be prosecuted for misdemeanors
their families have no immunity of any kind
determining what distinguishes an official act from a personal one is often not cut - and - dry
" no law enforcement officer , @entity20 officer , diplomatic mission , or consulate is authorized to determine whether a given set of circumstances constitutes an official act. , " the document states
" this is an issue which may only be resolved by the court with subject matter jurisdiction over the alleged crime
" a consular officer who is charged may argue that the allegations involve official acts
if the court agrees , the case must be dismissed
@entity3 is accused of submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her female housekeeper , paying her less than the amount stated
it 's unclear whether she 'll argue that the alleged act would be in the performance of her official duties , rather than personal
some personnel within diplomatic missions would n't have to face such questions
diplomatic agents , who have the highest level of immunity , " enjoy complete personal inviolability , which means that they may not be handcuffed ( except in extraordinary circumstances ) , arrested , or detained , " the @entity20 document says
" diplomatic agents also enjoy complete immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the host country 's courts and thus can not be prosecuted no matter how serious the offense unless their immunity is waived by the sending state
" in most cases , these kinds of issues are resolved through negotiations , @entity10 says
" the courts rarely get involved
because the countries have a lot of connections to each other , there 's a lot of interest in both sides in resolving it without recourse at the courts
