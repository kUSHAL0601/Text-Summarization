-- a new diet drug approved by the @entity2 in july is now available for obese and at - risk overweight patients
the oral medication @entity5 can only be obtained with a doctor 's prescription
@entity5 ( pronounced kyoo - @entity9 - uh ) is the second diet drug approved this year
the @entity2 approved a weight - loss pill called @entity12 on june 27
patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with @entity5 than with @entity12
on @entity5 , patients went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds ; on @entity12 , the average weight dropped from 220 to 207
@entity5 had been known as @entity5 until its approval
the @entity2 asked the company to change the name to avoid confusion with another drug on the market , according to the company
health care costs to bulge along with @entity27 waistlines some consumer advocates worry that the medication 's weight loss comes with a price
some patients in the clinical trial suffered an increased heart rate and a condition called metabolic acidosis , which can lead to hyperventilation , fatigue and anorexia
concerns have also been raised about birth defects
one of the ingredients in @entity5 is topiramate , an anti-convulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures
@entity5 's other ingredient is phentermine , an appetite suppressant
" our belief is that women will be invited ( through ) compelling advertising and marketing messages to experiment on themselves with a drug that has some effectiveness with healthy weight loss but possible serious risks , " said @entity56 , executive director of the @entity57
@entity5 's manufacturer , @entity66 , says that the drug helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in obese people and that people taking it were less likely to get type ii diabetes
not enough good data to back obesity drug , panel says " obesity is not being adequately addressed by diet and lifestyle changes or currently available therapies , " the company said
" the need for new options is urgent , particularly nonsurgical options
" the @entity2 approved @entity5 only for obese people or for overweight people with a body mass index greater than 27 who also suffer from weight - related conditions like hypertension and diabetes
doctors are free to prescribe the drug to anyone , however , and there are concerns that physicians will open " pill mills " and prescribe @entity5 to people who just want to lose a few pounds
that 's what happened in the 1990s with fen - phen , another diet drug combination that includes phentermine
an @entity2 advisory committee voted against @entity5 's approval in 2010
the panel recommended the drug 's approval with a 20 - 2 vote in february , after @entity66 proposed a risk management program to limit @entity5 's distribution and published additional results from one of its three clinical trials
@entity66 is offering the pill only through mail order , so doctors ca n't sell it directly , said dr. @entity117 , @entity66 ' vice president of scientific communications and risk management
" there will not be dispensing from doctors ' offices , " she said
" seeing that issue and what has happened in fad and diet drugs in the past , that is not a path that we 're going to be taking
" the 4,430 overweight and obese patients in the @entity5 studies experienced various levels of weight loss
about half of patients on the recommended dose lost 10 % of their weight , while four - fifths lost 5 %
that amounts to about 12 pounds for a 227 - pound person
@entity140 , one of the patients , started out at 230 pounds and lost 48 pounds her first year on the drug and another two pounds the second year
" i loved it , " she said
" i was n't hungry
i almost had to remind myself to eat
" at 5 feet 9 inches tall , @entity144 , now 63 , describes herself as having been " @entity147 - like " in college , weighing 120 pounds
then she gained weight after having four children
an avid cook and eater , she said the drug made it easier to resist tempting foods
@entity2 advisers recommend diet drug " if i saw a chocolate - chip cookie , it was easy enough for me to say , ' i 'm not really hungry
i can pass on it , ' " @entity144 said
she said the weight came off gradually , about four pounds a month , and her blood pressure went down almost immediately
in february , dr. @entity162 was one of two @entity2 advisory committee members who voted against @entity5 's approval
" i believe that if the public were to ' buy ' ( @entity5 ) after @entity2 approval , it would run the risk of severe , even fatal , consequences from another diet lemon , " @entity162 wrote in @entity165 , also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates
the @entity2 and @entity66 both acknowledge that the three clinical trials meant to measure @entity5 's safety and effectiveness were not designed to properly assess cardiovascular risk
the @entity2 has required @entity66 to do a study on the drug 's cardiovascular effects
@entity66 earlier said it would be done after the drug 's approval
despite the label 's warning that women of childbearing age should use birth control while on @entity5 , there are concerns that women will still get pregnant while on the drug
the @entity2 recommends a pregnancy test every month while on @entity5
in the drug - maker 's two - year clinical trial , 34 women on @entity5 became pregnant , even though they were told repeatedly to use contraception
no birth defects happened in those pregnancies , according to the company
previous clinical trials of topiramate , one of the ingredients in @entity5 , have shown a risk of about five birth defects for every 1,000 pregnancies
comparing the anti-obesity drug to treatments for other chronic diseases , @entity117 said patients will probably need to continue taking @entity5 long - term , though the new drug is not expected to be widely covered by health insurance plans
@entity2 rejects another obesity drug @entity144 , the patient who lost 50 pounds on the drug , said she has gained back about 20 pounds since the clinical trial ended two years ago and looks forward to going on @entity5 once it 's approved , even though it can have side effects
" there are side effects to everything , " she said
she added that the drug was n't the only reason she lost weight
weekly counseling on nutrition and exercise were a big factor , too
the counselor helped her change her diet -- choosing a salad for lunch instead of a burger , forgoing pasta and potatoes at dinner -- and encouraged her to walk a few times a week in addition to her regular exercise as goalie in a women 's soccer league
" before the medicine , i had been telling the girls they 'd have to find a new goalie , because i could n't dive for the ball like i did before , " she said
" then i lost the weight , and i was diving and bouncing back up and having a great old time again
