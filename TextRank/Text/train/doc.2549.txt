@entity0 -- early editions of @entity4 's leading newspaper thursday displayed a large front - page photo claiming to be an " unprecedented " and " exclusive " look at @entity9 president @entity8 's medical treatment in @entity10
but the intubated man lying in a hospital bed shown in the photo was n't @entity8 , the newspaper soon discovered , and it began backtracking
@entity15 took down the photo , which was on the newspaper 's website for about 30 minutes , and also recalled the early editions of its newspaper from newsstands
" after learning that the image offered did not correspond to @entity8 , @entity15 also stopped distributing the print edition and started to send a new edition to retail outlets , " the newspaper said in a statement on its website , explaining the retraction and apologizing to readers
@entity9 vp accuses ' infiltrators ' of murder plot against him @entity15 declined to comment on the matter to @entity1
the newspaper 's online statement said the photo had been provided by an agency that claimed it was an authentic image of @entity8
" the daily has opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of what happened and the errors that could have been committed in the verification of the photo , " the statement said
several purported photos of the @entity9 leader have circulated on social media in recent weeks , but @entity9 's government has n't released any new photos of @entity8 since he underwent cancer surgery in @entity10 more than six weeks ago
the 58 - year - old president has n't made any public appearances since then , either
the quick retraction by @entity15 did not quell sharp criticism from the @entity9 government and many on social media , who slammed the newspaper and said the photo was clearly taken from a 2008 @entity63 video that had nothing to do with @entity8
@entity8 ally : ailing president undergoing physical therapy " as grotesque as it is false , the photo of ' @entity8 intubated ' that today the venerable @entity4 newspaper @entity15 published on its front page , " @entity9 information minister @entity68 said in a @entity70 post
later thursday , @entity75 said the @entity9 government plans to pursue legal action against the newspaper " so that these type of acts do not go unpunished
" " we will use all the legal tools within our reach to proceed to repair the damage caused not only to @entity85 , the president , but also to all of @entity9 society , " he said
the photo 's publication , @entity75 said , was evidence of a right - wing media campaign that aims to spread fear and destabilize @entity9
he also objected to the nature of the image , arguing that the newspaper 's editors never would have permitted the publication of a similar photo of a @entity99 president or a member of their own families
@entity102 , head of @entity9 's @entity103 , said publishing the photo was no accident
" nobody believes that the photo that appears in @entity15 of @entity4 is something accidental , " he wrote in a @entity70 post , arguing that the motive behind the photo 's publication was clear : " hatred
" @entity114 president @entity113 also took to @entity70 to criticize the @entity4 newspaper , calling the photo a " dirty trick
" @entity118 was getting ready to open a bundle of newspapers as she set up her newsstand in @entity0 early thursday when she got word of the problem
" do n't open it
i have to take the newspapers , " @entity118 said a distributor told her
" there was a problem , and they have to change the front page
" nothing like that has ever happened before , particularly with the prominent @entity15 , @entity118 said
" it 's unbelievable , because with the number of filters it goes through , it is a little strange , truly , " @entity118 said
the newspaper provided additional details into its decision - making in an article posted online thursday night , titled , " the photo that @entity15 never should have published
" " the newspaper will revise its verification procedures in view of the errors committed , " the article said
but the @entity15 article also said that after being assured by a news agency that the photo was authentic and taken by a @entity10 nurse who had been part of @entity8 's medical team , @entity15 had no way to confirm details about when the picture was taken " due to the information restrictions under the @entity10 regime
" there was a lengthy debate among the paper 's editors about whether to publish the hospital photo , the newspaper said
" the conclusion reached was that the image was relevant at a time when the health of @entity9 president is a source of great controversy and heated political debate in his country , because of his absence during his inauguration and ... in light of the lack of transparency of the authorities , " @entity15 said
