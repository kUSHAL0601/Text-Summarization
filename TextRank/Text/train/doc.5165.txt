-- it 's that time of year again
this weekend , you 'll sacrifice an hour of sleep in exchange for a few months of extra daylight
@entity6 officially started at 2 a.m. on sunday
if you have n't set your clocks forward yet , do it before you return to work on monday
@entity6 ends the first sunday in november
@entity9 first thought up the idea of daylight saving in 1784
it was n't instituted until @entity13 , when it went into effect to save energy used for lights
the @entity18 established time zones and daylight saving in 1918 , but it was short - lived
daylight saving was repealed the following year
@entity6 may bring health problems the @entity24 established @entity6 throughout the @entity25 and gave states the option to exempt themselves
@entity29 and most of @entity30 do not follow @entity6
@entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 and @entity34 also skip out on the clock - changing fun
in 1974 and 1975 , @entity37 extended daylight saving to save energy during the energy crisis
in 2007 , @entity6 got a few weeks longer , running from the second sunday in march to the first sunday in november
about 70 countries around the world observe daylight saving , but many countries near the equator do not
it 's not universally popular , though
farmers note that their livestock do n't live by a clock , and complain that they have to adjust their working hours to deal with the animals
also , any parent will tell you -- babies do n't quite get it either
which do you prefer -- more daylight or more sleep ? weigh in below .
