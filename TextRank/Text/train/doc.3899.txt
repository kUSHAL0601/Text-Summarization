@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 was sworn in thursday as the new @entity5 senator from @entity6 to fill the seat formerly held by the late sen. @entity8 , and immediately signaled opposition to president @entity11 's spending plans
@entity2 's new @entity13 colleagues applauded after the ceremony on the floor of the @entity13 chamber conducted by vice president @entity17 , in his capacity as president of the @entity13
@entity21 sen. @entity20 , also of @entity6 , and @entity2 's wife , @entity22 , accompanied @entity2 into the chamber
at a news conference after the ceremony , @entity2 thanked @entity6 voters who gave him a surprise victory in the january 19 special election in a state that had not elected a @entity3 senator since 1972
" i ca n't promise i 'll be right in every vote i make
i 'm sure i 'll make mistakes from time to time , " @entity2 said
" but i will try to learn and grow and do the very best job i can on a day - to - day basis
" @entity2 's election victory stripped @entity35 of their 60 - seat @entity13 supermajority , imperiling the ability of @entity11 and @entity35 to push major legislative priorities such as health care reform through @entity40
the @entity3 upset in @entity6 also raised fears among many congressional @entity35 of a potential @entity3 landslide in november 's midterm elections
a fiscal conservative who holds some moderate views , @entity2 was noncommittal on whether he would support a @entity3 filibuster in coming @entity13 consideration of some @entity11 nominees for government posts
he also said he needed to talk to generals in the field before deciding to support @entity11 's call , supported by top military leaders , to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy regarding a ban on gays in the military
@entity2 made clear he opposes the spending policies of the @entity11 administration , stating that the $ 862 billion stimulus bill passed last year " did n't create one new job " in @entity6 or across the country
he also said @entity40 should start over on health care with bipartisan talks , instead of continuing work on separate comprehensive bills passed by the @entity69 and @entity13
that prompted a response later from @entity72 , spokesman for @entity17 , who said , " anyone can go to @entity74 ( on the @entity75 ) and see that @entity6 state and local government , businesses and community organizations have already reported directly funding over 9,000 jobs in the state last year -- and that 's based on a only a portion of the total $ 8.4 billion in ( stimulus ) funds that have already gone to @entity6
" he also said @entity40 should start over on health care with bipartisan talks , instead of continuing work on separate comprehensive bills passed by the @entity69 and @entity13
at the same time , @entity2 said he would consider each piece of legislation on merit , rather than whether it was proposed by one party or another
" if i see a bill that 's good for my state first , i do n't care where it comes from , " @entity2 said
" if it 's good for @entity6 , i 'll consider it
" thursday 's ceremony occurred a week earlier than originally planned
@entity6 officials had said it would take a few weeks after the election to certify the result of @entity2 's victory
in a letter to @entity6 gov. @entity104 and secretary of state @entity105 on wednesday , @entity2 's attorney said the senator - elect had planned on being sworn in on february 11 , but had been told that several @entity13 votes would be held before then
" for this reason , he wants certification to occur immediately , " attorney @entity108 wrote
the certification occurred thursday , allowing @entity2 to officially fill his seat later in the day
" there 's no hidden agenda , " @entity2 said of his push to get certified this week instead of next
" it 's because i want to get to work
" asked why his daughters did n't attend the swearing - in , @entity2 explained one of them , @entity120 , had a college basketball game to play thursday and the other , @entity122 , had a college exam
" the bibles i used for today 's swearing - in belong to my daughters , and i stacked them one on top of the other and took my oath on them , " @entity2 said
@entity2 will be taking over @entity8 's coveted office space in the @entity133 building
sen. @entity134 , who was appointed to fill the seat after @entity8 's death , currently occupies the office and will move out
several @entity13 sources tell @entity1 that the @entity139 , which assigns office space , decided to give @entity2 the office space as a matter of convenience
because of his seniority , @entity8 had one of the most coveted office suites in the @entity13 complex
it is located in the @entity133 building , down the hall from the @entity151 , and has balconies that overlook the @entity153
@entity1 senior congressional correspondent @entity154 contributed to this report .
