if you select this option , you will not be eligible for a cash payment
but some experts say the value of this benefit is limited
" the score you 're being shown is n't your fico score , " says credit expert @entity75
and the @entity80 score , established by @entity80 , is the score that most lenders look at when extending credit
the difference between your @entity3 credit score , called @entity85 , and your @entity80 score wo n't be drastic
but , there could be a difference of 40 - 50 points , says @entity75
another problem is that there are n't many lenders who use this credit score , says @entity75
in fact , he speculates that less than 5 percent of lenders will use it

consumer advocates are concerned this could cause confusion
" i expect there are lots of people under the impression that they have excellent credit [ who ] get shocked when they get a car loan for much more than those with truly excellent credit would receive , " says @entity117 of @entity118 , a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization
however , consumers will benefit from having their credit monitored for free
" @entity3 has a reputable monitoring service , " says @entity75
sometimes consumers will like the experience of being updated on their credit report
other consumers will just shrug
in the end , it 's nice to have free three months of anything
the deal ends a class - action lawsuit that was filed after @entity3 sold customer information in the form of marketing lists to other businesses
the company says it discontinued that practice in 2001
under the terms of the agreement , the company will set up a $ 75 million fund to spread the word about the settlement and to pay attorneys and other claims
