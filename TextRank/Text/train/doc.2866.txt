-- as the new school year approaches , president @entity1 has been traveling around talking about the high cost of education
in a speech given on august 22 in @entity6 , @entity7 , he laid out a plan to rein in the costs , describing affordable and accessible education as " @entity12 's highest priority
" but the education system is n't broken -- it 's " fixed
" if we 're serious about tackling the issue of affordable education and student debt , we need to strike at the root of the problem -- the influence of money in politics
private corporations like @entity24 -- which own 15 % or $ 162.5 billion dollars of total student debt -- rake in private - island - purchasing profits while students suffer
it 's impossible to be on a college campus -- especially a state university -- and not notice the impact of the student debt crisis
the debt weighs on our students
it is as if you could see it in their slumping postures and staggering gaits as they haul boulders and lug chains from class to class
approximately 37 million students currently hold debt , averaging $ 27,500 per person and totaling over $ 1.1 trillion
saddled with debt , students are giving up on the idea of the @entity53
you know , like the idea that you and your buddy can open up a small ice cream shop in an old gas station and grow it into a multimillion dollar business that cares for the community and delights the world
the truth is , if @entity65 and i had had $ 27,000 of debt in 1978 , we would never have taken the risk of opening our first scoop shop
more likely than not , we would have been underemployed and buried in back payments
in @entity6 , he said : " the idea used to be that here in @entity74 anybody could make it
... and , unfortunately , what 's happened is it 's gotten tougher for a lot of folks
so we 've got to reverse these trends
" but while @entity1 talks about creating policies that will benefit the middle class , corporations like @entity24 are dedicated to preserving the status quo by showering @entity86 with cash
according to the @entity88 , @entity24 has donated over $ 1.26 million to federal candidates and parties in the last four election cycles and bankrolled $ 1.93 million dollars lobbying @entity92 in the first half 2013
during that time , @entity92 crafted a student loan bill that tied interest rates to financial markets , which president @entity1 signed it into law in august
while in the short term , the bill prevented interest rates from doubling , students are more vulnerable in face of an adjustable interest rate that could top 8.5 %
corporations like @entity24 borrow at dirt cheap interest rates ( subsidized between .23 % and .34 % ) from the @entity106 banks
in contrast , undergraduate students borrow at an adjustable 3.85 % and graduate students borrow at an adjustable 5.4 %
that 's a sweetheart deal for @entity24 which raked in $ 2.5 billion in interest payments from student loans last year , but a terrible deal for students
in a letter to @entity24 's ceo , sen. @entity115 wrote : " while @entity24 is finding unique ways to profit from government programs , its borrowers are paying interest rates that are far in excess of the low cost of funds supported by the @entity74 taxpayers
" it 's time to dam the deluge of cash and corporate influence in @entity12 once and for all
whether you 're a college student , a debt holder , a parent or simply someone concerned about the future of our country , you can help
there is a stampede rumbling across the country to amend the @entity142 to declare : 1 ) money is not free speech ; and 2 ) corporation are not people
at @entity148 , we 're helping to build that movement by legally stamping messages like " not to be used for @entity151 " on our nation 's currency to spread the word and get money out of politics
every bill is seen by 875 people , so the more stamped bills that enter circulation , the more movement will grow
thanks to the leadership by groups like @entity166 , move to amend , @entity167 , @entity168 for people and @entity170 , 16 states have passed referendums calling on @entity92 to take action and over 150 members of @entity92 support the amendment strategy
as the new school semester begins , pick up a stamp and help take back our campus and take back @entity92
this is our future and our fight to win
