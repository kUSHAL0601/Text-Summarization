yet 10 years after his death , he 's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that 's long defined relations among and between @entity5 and @entity6
so , too , has the violence that 's marred the region for decades
recent incidents have stirred fears in @entity5 of a return to 2002 , then in the midst of a second intifada , or armed uprising , when the @entity5 government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks
on one day alone last week , an @entity5 soldier was stabbed to death on a @entity22 street while three @entity5 were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same @entity24 hitchhiking post where three @entity5 teens were kidnapped earlier this year
this followed several incidents in which drivers ran their vehicles into crowds on busy streets
then came tuesday , when two knife - and ax - wielding @entity6 cousins killed four @entity5 worshiping inside a @entity34 synagogue
' @entity36 attack ' at @entity34 synagogue so does this all mean a third intifada is coming , if it 's not already here ? no -- or , at least , not yet , according to experts
much has changed , they point out , since @entity0 's death
it 's harder than ever to get from the @entity24 into @entity5 , especially with explosives and such
there has been no call to arms by the @entity6 leadership in the @entity24 ; instead , analysts say , there has been significant cooperation with @entity5 authorities to ferret out potential attackers
and there have n't been anything close yet to the coordinated , large - scale attacks in @entity5 like those of the early 2000s
as retired former @entity5 national security adviser maj. gen. @entity56 pointed out last week , what 's happening now " falls far from " the first two intifadas , as far as the overall threat to @entity5
but one thing that has n't changed is the deep frustration among @entity6
now , as was the case over a decade ago , many still harbor steep distrust of @entity5 authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough
" the nature of these movements is that a spark could ignite the tinder , " said @entity67 , the head of the @entity70 ' @entity69 program
" ... and once it starts moving , you have no idea where it 's going to go
" @entity5 troop kill @entity6 man in @entity24 clashes voids in @entity6 hope , leadership @entity0 is still considered a hero among many @entity6 , as the scenes around the @entity24 commemorating his death november 11 showed
this was a man , according to his supporters , who stood up to @entity5
this was a man who rallied @entity6 to fight
this was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent @entity6 state
@entity99 cancels @entity0 memorials after bombings , blames @entity102 not only is there no more @entity0 , but the idea of a unified @entity6 front is a thing of the past as well
@entity0 's former group , @entity99 , now controls the @entity24 under @entity109 president @entity108 , while rival @entity102 is in charge of @entity112
" you have an unprecedented division , " said the @entity114 's @entity113 , contrasting that to what he views as @entity5 leadership that 's become more conservative and less willing to compromise
" it 's a much weaker leadership than we 've ever seen
" the lack of a unifying figure , like @entity0 , has led to a " complete alienation of the people from leadership , " said @entity127 of the @entity128 in @entity34
not only do n't they have a person to rally around , there 's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many @entity6
" people really have no expectation , no hope , no perspective in terms of there being any chance that comes through a political initiative , " @entity127 told @entity136 from her home in @entity138
" so what we have is an outburst of frustration
" what there is not , however , is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against @entity5 -- which was unlike , many say , what happened during the second intifada
in some ways , that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel , only the attacker may know what will happen next
" this is a huge problem because there is no intelligence , " @entity56 told reporters on a call coordinated by the @entity167
" someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying , ' today , i 'll kill some @entity5
' " there is no organization behind it , " the former @entity5 national security adviser said , noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack
" ... i do n't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual ( like that )
" 2 killed , 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on @entity5 @entity5 policies have an impact what 's happening and what 's not happening , if you 're talking about major attacks , is a testament to @entity5 's policies as well
a lot has changed since what @entity5 called the " @entity196 massacre , " when a man walked into a seaside hotel in 2002 and blew himself up , killing 30 civilians
for one , a wall -- or a fence , depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the @entity24 and @entity5 , making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons
also , @entity5 has a renowned intelligence apparatus that 's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers
this is on top of other policies , like stringent measures restricting citizens ' ownership of firearms
and even as it pushes for independence , the @entity109 has quietly become a working security partner with @entity5 authorities
behind the scenes , the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks , not to mention common foes from @entity102
" the two have worked together , and it has prevented many terror attacks inside @entity5 , " said the @entity167 's @entity227 , predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds
" and it has also brought much more calm
" yet as clashes in the @entity24 last week showed , it sometimes does n't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand
and @entity6 do n't live only there and in @entity112
many live in @entity5 , including some 300,000 in @entity34 , where there has been recent unrest centered around what @entity242 know as the @entity244 and @entity245 call the @entity244
" the fear for @entity5 is that the new terrorists ( will be ) on this side of the fence , " said @entity227
violence , bad feelings never went away even then , discontent among so - called @entity252 is not a new thing either
in fact , experts say -- from a security situation -- @entity5 appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago
the measures it 's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence
but according to @entity127 , @entity6 ' frustrations " have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons
" she says that many feel that @entity5 -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for " normal lives
" " people want to take care of their families , get their kids to school , have enough income to live off of , " she said
" and then the pressure just builds up
that 's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration
" @entity113 , from @entity114 , said more forceful responses by @entity5 to attacks can backfire , reasoning , " when you respond to violence with more repression , you 're going to get more violence
" the " primitive assault tactics " now being used against @entity5 -- knives and cars , rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the @entity6 ' storyline , especially if @entity5 security forces respond " with a heavy hand " as prime minister @entity306 's office promised after tuesday 's synagogue attack , expert @entity297 said
" ( such tactics ) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation ; they can claim ' we do n't have better means of disposal , ' " said @entity297 , from the @entity5 - based @entity316
" it 's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party
" it 's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace , security and happiness to both @entity5 and @entity6 -- that has some especially worried
if there 's no political end in sight , what 's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build ? " it 's probably not going to get a lot worse , and it 's almost certainly not going to get a lot better , " said @entity331 , the director of the @entity333 's @entity332
" the best you can say , on both sides , is , ' well , at least we 're not like @entity340 and @entity341
