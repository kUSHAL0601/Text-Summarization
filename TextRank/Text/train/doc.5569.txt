-- the wife of @entity3 @entity2 said tuesday that she reached out to @entity4 , whose accusations of sexual harassment almost derailed @entity2 ' high court nomination 19 years ago
in a statement to @entity0 , @entity8 said : " i did place a call to @entity11 at her office extending an olive branch to her after all these years , in hopes that we could ultimately get past what happened so long ago
that offer still stands , i would be very happy to meet and talk with her if she would be willing to do the same
certainly no offense was ever intended
" @entity4 , a law professor at @entity23 , turned the message over to campus security , a university spokesman said
according to a source at @entity23 who spoke on condition of not being identified , the message left over the weekend said : " good morning , @entity4 , it 's @entity8
i just wanted to reach across the airwaves and the years and ask you to consider something
i would love you to consider an apology some time and some full explanation of why you did what you did with my husband
so give it some thought and certainly pray about this and come to understand why you did what you did
ok , have a good day
" @entity4 , who formerly worked for @entity2 , testified at his 1991 @entity43 confirmation hearing that he used inappropriate sexual language around her
the testimony dominated the hearing by the @entity47 , which deadlocked on the nomination to send it to the full @entity43 without a recommendation
the @entity43 approved @entity2 ' nomination on a 52 - 48 vote
@entity53 , the @entity23 director of news and communications , said @entity4 received the voicemail message and turned it over to the campus @entity57 , which then turned it over to the @entity59
" i certainly thought the call was inappropriate , " @entity4 said in a statement to @entity0 issued by @entity23
" i have no intention of apologizing because i testified truthfully about my experience and i stand by that testimony
" @entity8 is a conservative activist who founded the organization @entity66 .
