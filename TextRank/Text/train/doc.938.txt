@entity1 , @entity0 -- leading @entity5 cabinet minister @entity4 's political future is in doubt after her husband admitted to paying for adult movies with taxpayers ' money
@entity4 surrounded by media outside her sister 's home , whom she lives with in @entity1
the home secretary 's husband , @entity16 , has apologized for the " embarrassment " he caused his wife , while she has promised to repay the money spent , including the £ 10 ( $ 14 ) charge for the two films , the @entity15 reported
according to @entity5 media reports , @entity4 had not seen the videos and was " mortified " that they had " mistakenly " been paid for using her mp 's expense account
@entity16 , who @entity4 pays £ 40,000 ( $ 56,000 ) a year to be her office manager , submitted an expense claim last june for a £ 67 ( $ 95 ) @entity32 bill for television services in the couple 's family home in @entity37 , @entity4 's constituency , @entity40 newspaper reported
it reported the bill included two adult films , at a cost of £ 5 ( $ 7 ) each , as well as two viewings of the heist movie " @entity46 " and one of " @entity48 , " a children 's film about a penguin
the revelations could not come at a worse time for @entity4 , who is already being investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over her decision to claim at least £ 116,000 ( $ 164,000 ) in second - home allowances for her family home since becoming an mp
she has claimed the second - home allowance for her family home while living with her sister in @entity1
@entity4 designated her sister 's house as her " main " residence , allowing her to claim the money for her family home
conservative and opposition leader @entity66 described the latest news as " deeply embarrassing " for @entity4
he said @entity4 had " questions to answer , " @entity69 reported
" i do not think this individual thing is the issue
i think she has got some questions to answer about the second home issue
it does seem to me pretty incredible to claim that the home where her family is , that is not her main home
" i think this goes to a deeper problem , which is the second home allowance for mps
the prime minister has ordered a review but he has sort of kicked it into the long grass
" the review does n't start until september , it is not going to report until after the next election
we have got to get on with it
" prime minister @entity93 defended @entity4
" the home secretary is doing a great job and i do not think this issue should be allowed to detract from everything she is doing to ensure we protect the public and keep our neighborhoods safe , " he said
" she has done the right thing by taking steps to rectify the mistake that was made as soon as she became aware of it
" this is very much a personal matter for @entity4
she has made her apology , her husband has made clear that he has apologized
" last week @entity93 ordered a review of the complex and opaque system of @entity84 ' pay and allowances
do you think @entity4 should resign ?
