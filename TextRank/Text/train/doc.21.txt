-- the only thing @entity2 treasures more than winning is a decent nap
@entity2 knocks @entity4 out of the @entity5 on february 17 , 2009
just before a match , when other top tennis players might be psyching themselves up for a three - set onslaught , the elder of the @entity2 sisters can be found somewhere private , snoozing
" i 'm always sleepy , " she told @entity0 in an interview for this month 's edition of " revealed
" " i 'm literally taking a nap during the first set and the match before me , so i 'm probably the only person that can go to sleep , come out 15 minutes later and start playing
" wary of sending the wrong signals to her rivals , the sixth seed confessed to @entity0 that she prefers to take her naps in private
" i 'm wondering if my competitor is going to see me here , so i try to act like i 'm not asleep , but i am asleep , or i try to find a place where i can sleep in and no one will see me , " she laughs
the lightning - fast speed of @entity2 ' serve is at complete odds with her personality
she is strong , ambitious and determined , but also surprisingly laid - back for someone whose professional career is about playing harder , longer and faster
" i just always go with the flow , " she told @entity0
" on the court , that 's when i get most intense
in practice , i scream and yell and threaten to throw my racquet but in the match i 'm not like that at all
" her younger sister , world number one @entity37 , sounds almost envious of @entity2 ' ability to keep her emotions in check
" @entity2 is really , really unusually composed and that 's just her style , " @entity37 told @entity0
" on the court she 's always really focused
she always has this quiet tenacity and she never really shows her emotions which i think is good
" the youngest of five sisters , @entity37 says she continues to draw inspiration from her closest sibling
@entity2 is just 15 months older than @entity37
she set the marker for success in 2002 when she became the first of the sisters to become world number one
@entity37 first took the title in july of the same year and reclaimed it earlier this month
" she 's my bigger sister , she 's my older sister , she 's a role model for me , " @entity37 said
" i 'm always trying to do what she does
if she 's going on the right path then i 'm going on the right path too
if she 's working hard then i want to work hard also
i 'm the little sister who wants to be just like the big sister , " she added
if they once struggled to find the required ruthlessness to eliminate each other from a competition , it is clearly no longer a problem
of 18 matches they have contested , each sister has won nine
at the time of writing , there is every chance they will meet again this week in the semi-final of the @entity5
they last clashed at the @entity78 in @entity79 in november 2008 when @entity2 dispatched @entity37 in three hard - fought sets before going on to win her first end of season title
asked after the match about accusations they do n't play as hard against each other as they would normal rivals , @entity2 replied , " you have to play hard against a @entity2 or you are going home quickly
we try our hardest and i think that everyone knows that by the effort level
" their mother , @entity93 , told @entity0 she keeps her advice on the subject simple
" i just tell them to remember they are sisters and how love and how to care for one another is more important than anything , " she said
" so , this is just a game and eventually it would be over and you will have to live with each other
so , just go out there and do your best and whoever wins , wins
and whoever loses , better luck next time
" having said that , @entity93 admits she keeps her distance from whoever comes out second best , in any match
" they do n't want to be talked to , they do n't want you telling them anything , they just want to be left alone and that 's what i do , " she told @entity0
there is no need for tip - toeing today
@entity2 made fast work of @entity122 @entity4 , beating the 17 - year - old 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 in less than one hour in the second round of the @entity5
@entity2 told @entity0 her ambition this year is to topple @entity37 to become the world number one
" i think i am in a great position to do that , " she said
