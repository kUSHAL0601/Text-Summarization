@entity1 , @entity0 -- the wisdom of business professors , once only available to mbas and business students , can now be accessed by anybody with an internet connection
at @entity11 , @entity10 students are given an @entity12 so they can download podcasts of lectures
hundreds of universities , and a growing number of business schools , are making recordings of lectures , seminars and conferences available to the general public via web sites such as @entity24 and @entity25
leading business schools including @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 make course content available for download through @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , part of the of the @entity24 online store
that means those whose budget wo n't stretch to a two - year mba can simulate the experience at home -- or at work , in the gym or anywhere else they choose
and even better for money - conscious learners , the @entity33 content can all be downloaded free of charge
@entity49 business school @entity11 is due to launch its @entity33 content in the next few months , but it has been running an ambitious podcast program since 2006
begun as an experiment in partnership with @entity55 , all new mbas at @entity11 are provided with an @entity12
around half of the @entity10 lectures are filmed using an automatic camera system and the footage is made available for students to download and view on their iphones
@entity63 , @entity11 's project manager for @entity33 , told @entity2 that the @entity12 - enabled curriculum has proved a hit with students
as well watching lectures , she said the students ' own presentations are recorded and made available for download so they can review their performance
she says one teacher noticed that each year his @entity10 students would ask the same questions after his end - of - course summary , so he made a podcast of recurring questions and answers
after encouraging students to come up with new questions , he is now recording responses to those in an effort to compile a video archive of questions and answers
read more business features @entity87 says that by making lectures available via @entity33 , @entity11 wants to be at the forefront of providing content for the rest of the world , but she acknowledges that the technology is also a great way to promote the business school
" it 's a good marketing tool , not as publicity but to really show people what we are providing , " she told @entity2
" you can watch a lecture , learn a lot and think ' i wish i could be there
' the idea is to show what you could learn if you were at this place
" @entity25 was launched in march this year and hosts the @entity25 channels of hundreds of universities
earlier this month it added content from 45 universities in @entity114 and @entity115 and now holds videos of lectures and discussions provided by business schools including @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122
launched at the same time as @entity25 , @entity123 hosts videos from @entity126 universities including @entity127 , @entity29 and @entity128 , although the business content is provided almost exclusively by @entity130
offering less audio / visual content , but still full of business school information , @entity133 's @entity132 site gives free access to almost all @entity133 course content , including extensive lecture notes , assignments and exams from @entity133 's @entity141
interested in the " @entity142 in @entity143 ? " you can download the complete lecture notes from @entity147 's 2007 course on the subject at @entity133 's @entity132 site
other universities have their own @entity132 sites and the @entity151 has been set up as an agglomerator site , providing content from more over 200 higher education institutions
but it 's @entity33 that 's generating the most interest
the @entity157 says there have been more than one million downloads from its @entity33 site , while @entity130 says its course on creating @entity163 applications was downloaded more than one million times in just seven weeks
this week 's most popular business download on @entity33 is a @entity157 lecture called " @entity167 and the @entity168
" it may not get as many downloads as @entity172 's posthumous single , but it should prove more useful when it comes to getting a business off the ground .
