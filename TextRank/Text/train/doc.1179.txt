-- with tears streaming down his face , @entity1 said farewell in his final home game as a professional footballer saturday
made captain for the night by @entity9 coach @entity8 , he played his full part in a 3 - 1 win for the new @entity13 champions over @entity14
but on 82 minutes , with the realization that his glittering 847 - game career was winding down , the raw emotion of the moment got the better of the most iconic player of his generation
given a standing ovation by the near 45,000 strong capacity crowd in the @entity24 , @entity1 hugged teammates and opponents before being substituted by @entity27
@entity28 and friends , including his pop star wife @entity30 , were in the stands to watch him as was former @entity13 president @entity32
he had even donned a special pair of commemorative boots for the occasion -- bearing the date may 18 and the names of his children , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
@entity1 was going out on a high and although @entity9 have an away match at @entity46 to complete a triumphant season his appearance in that match is considered highly unlikely
. it was his 10th league championship title -- won with four clubs -- @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and now @entity9 , the players lifting the trophy after their final home match
the former @entity57 captain joined them for the run - in to the season and quickly won over the fans as she showed that despite his 38 years he had lost none of his trademark skills
it was on display again in his farewell home appearance , with raking cross-field balls regularly finding the target and he made the assist on @entity9 's second goal
@entity9 made a flying start with star striker @entity73 putting them ahead in the fifth minute
@entity1 's corner proved perfect for @entity76 to score the second with @entity73 blasting the third before halftime with a thunderous free kick
@entity80 pulled a late goal back for already relegated @entity14 , but it could not spoil the celebrations -- which went on long after the final whistle as the entire @entity9 squad , @entity1 included , were paraded ahead of the trophy celebration
@entity8 , who has led @entity9 to their first title in 19 years , said he wanted to make @entity1 's farewell special
" it was the right thing to do to choose @entity1 as captain for his last match
" all the players backed the decision
@entity1 will have a lovely memory of this night , " he told @entity93
@entity1 addressed fans after the match as the celebrations in the stadium continued long after the final whistle
" thanks to everyone in @entity102 , to all of my teammates , the staff and fans , " said the former @entity57 captain
" it 's been very special to finish my career here , " he added .
