-- five months into the country 's uprising , a defiant @entity2 regime continues its relentless assault on pro-reform protesters in the face of international rebuke and calls for restraint
the government has maintained the same narrative : it is going after armed terrorists
but opposition activists say it is a systematic , sustained slaughter
here is an explainer of what is happening inside and outside @entity2 as efforts to resolve the crisis continue
what are the protesters demanding ? initially , protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law
some of these reforms have , on paper , been implemented by president @entity31 , but it was far too little and , by the time it came about , too late
the protests started in march in reaction to the arrest of schoolchildren in the town of @entity39 for painting anti-government graffiti and snowballed
protestors now want a @entity2 free of the @entity31 regime and true democratic elections
@entity31 has been in power since 2000 ; his father , @entity46 , ruled @entity2 for three decades
how widespread are the protests ? demonstrations have erupted in several of @entity2 's largest cities -- @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- as well as the southern city of @entity39 , where protests began months ago
but @entity56 -- considered the largest city -- has been relatively quiet
it is the economic center of @entity2 and the city 's merchant class has been unaffected by the protests , for the most part
how many people have died in the unrest ? the @entity65 , a @entity66 - based activist group , said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-march
@entity69 , head of the observatory , said the dead include more than 1,600 civilians and more than 370 @entity2 security forces
@entity0 is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in @entity2 , which has restricted access to many parts of the country by international journalists
how has the @entity31 regime reacted to other uprisings ? there are fears from some in @entity2 of a repeat of the 1982 massacre by @entity2 's military -- acting under orders from @entity31 's father , @entity89 -- in which thousands of civilians are believed to have perished
the bloody crackdown by the @entity93 - dominated government against a @entity95 uprising took place in the western city of @entity51
estimates of the number of casualties vary from 3,000 to 40,000
a 1983 @entity102 report put the death toll on both sides as between 10,000 and 25,000
many activists are already comparing what is now in @entity51 under @entity89 's son -- but in slow motion rather than a single , devastating strike
the city has been at the epicenter of the anti-government movement roiling the country , prompting security forces to roll in with tanks in early august
what attempts has @entity31 made to meet protesters ' demands ? he lifted the state of emergency that had been in place for nearly half a century
he also abolished a court set up to try people posing a threat to the regime
but , at the same time , arbitrary detentions have continued , as has the use of force against demonstrators
in july , the @entity2 regime held a five - day " national dialogue " conference in @entity50 , saying it was designed to solicit viewpoints not only of @entity31 's loyalists , but also those wanting real change
but many opposition activists boycotted the meeting and called its stated mission a farce , given claims that the government has violently targeted hundreds who have openly called for change
who are @entity31 's allies ? @entity147 and @entity148 are key players , particularly when it comes to exerting influence in the @entity152
@entity153 is an important trading partner , but its relationship with @entity2 appears to have cooled
in early august , @entity157 's @entity156 condemned the crackdown on anti-government protesters , saying there was " no justification for the bloodshed
" while it is noteworthy that @entity157 has openly criticized @entity2 , it is not surprising
@entity157 is wary of @entity166 's influence in the region -- and @entity2 is @entity166 's closest ally there
can the @entity152 take military action ? the @entity170 tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion
due to history , location , politics and power , @entity2 has more allies than @entity181 and is unlikely to face similar @entity152 - mandated action
a @entity170 resolution authorized the use of force to protect civilians in @entity181
but the ensuing @entity188 's military campaign over @entity181 has drawn some criticism , which might play a role in holding off on similar action in @entity2
@entity147 and @entity148 usually feel it is not the @entity170 's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of @entity152 member countries
@entity2 's key role in the @entity201 peace process has also made military attacks extremely unlikely
what role is social media playing in the uprising ? if @entity206 was the " @entity208 revolution , " @entity2 is the @entity210 revolution
if not for activists posting videos to @entity210 , the outside world would not have a window into what is happening in @entity2
why is there no likelihood of @entity152 sanctions or military action against @entity2 ? the @entity170 tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion
due to history , location , politics and power , @entity2 has more allies than @entity181 is unlikely to face similar @entity152 - mandated action
a @entity170 resolution authorized the use of force to protect civilians in @entity181
but the ensuing @entity188 's military campaign over @entity181 has drawn some criticism , which might play a role in holding off on similar action in @entity2
@entity147 and @entity148 usually feel that it is not the @entity170 's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of @entity152 member countries
that said , they may eventually budge to at least join other members of the @entity170 in expressing concern or condemnation of what is happening in @entity2
but it will take more displays of @entity2 brutality for @entity147 and @entity148 to go along with sanctions
@entity2 's key role in the @entity201 peace process has also made military attacks extremely unlikely
is social media still playing a part in the uprising ? is it likely to have a decisive role in the final outcome ? it 's huge
it 's not the same as we saw in @entity206 , which has been labeled a @entity208 revolution because of the role of social networking sites
@entity2 is the @entity210 revolution
if activists were n't posting videos to @entity210 , we would have almost no window into what appears to be happening in @entity2
will it be decisive ? yes , absolutely
the reason why people have been able to have such a strong debate about crimes against humanity , about abuses , about the atrocities allegedly committed is because we 've had these images on hand
