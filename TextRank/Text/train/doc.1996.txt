-- @entity2 's life reads like a boy 's own adventure tale with a modern eco-twist
@entity2 was the first man to walk to both the @entity6
inspired by the daring age of @entity9 exploration , @entity2 followed in the footsteps of his heroes ; the men who risked , and lost , their lives to reach the @entity14
at the age of 29 he embarked on an expedition to the @entity14 that was unsupported -- a trek that required him to pull his own sleigh and that lacked medical support crews
by the time he was 33 he had become the first man to walk to both the @entity23 poles unsupported
but for @entity2 , the epic journeys to the @entity25 , and the sailing and overland adventures that have followed , unearthed more than just a spirit for adventure
he experienced firsthand the impact of humanity on the environment when under the hole in the ozone layer at the @entity14 , the harsh ultraviolet rays from the sun burned his skin and permanently changed the color of his eyes
it firmed a desire to preserve the fragile natural world and to educate and inspire others , particularly the next generation of decision - makers to do the same
" as the last unspoiled wilderness on @entity47 , @entity9 is currently protected by the treaty prohibiting drilling and mining until 2041
decisions made by today 's youth will impact our entire planet 's ecosystem and the future of life on earth , " he says on 2041.com
his polar icewalks gained international attention and in 1992 he was asked to speak at the @entity63 @entity62 in @entity64 , later gaining an obe and being appointed @entity66 to the director general of @entity68 in recognition of his work
at the @entity62 in @entity64 he committed to a " global mission " to remove 1,500 tons of waste from @entity9
@entity2 and a team of young people from across the world were successful in cleaning up the @entity77 @entity9 base of @entity78 by 2000 , making it inhabitable for wildlife again
foresight , planning and determination then are not alien to a man who spent five years sourcing the funding for his first @entity9 expedition , and @entity2 's latest project is taking an even longer - term view
@entity2 founded his organization " 2041 " in 2003 in order to further his mission of action and education
named after the year in which @entity9 's protection against mineral exploitation ends , @entity2 regularly takes business people , teachers and students on expeditions to @entity9 to impress on those with the capacity to enact change that preservation of the environment is essential and achievable
continuing the green mission on the continent by minimizing the human footprint in the region , his international teams have helped design and build the world 's first education station in @entity9 that is run solely on renewable energy
add to the expeditions , ocean voyages on a boat with sails made from recycled plastic bottles , and it 's clear that the veteran polar explorer is a man who is doing all he can to protect and preserve the @entity9 .
