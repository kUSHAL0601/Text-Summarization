-- @entity4 president @entity3 said tuesday that his country has " been able to control " the @entity6 drone that @entity4 claims it recently brought down , @entity2 state tv reported
" there are people here who have been able to control this spy plane , " @entity3 told @entity8
" those who have been in control of this spy plane surely will analyze the plane 's system
furthermore , the systems of @entity4 are so advanced also , like the system of this plane
" @entity3 did not elaborate or specify what precisely he meant when he referred to people " who have been able to control " the drone
he spoke in @entity22 , which @entity8 translated into @entity23
the @entity22 portion of the interview was not audible
president @entity26 said monday that the @entity6 has asked @entity4 to return the drone aircraft that @entity4 claims it recently brought down in @entity4 territory
" we 've asked for it back
we 'll see how the @entity4 respond , " @entity26 said
@entity3 's comments to @entity8 seemed to suggest that @entity4 did not plan to return the aircraft
" the @entity33 at best have decided to give us this spy plane , " @entity3 said
" in the unpiloted planes , we have had many advances , much progress and now we have this spy plane
" defense minister brigadier general @entity38 said the drone no longer belongs to @entity40
" the @entity6 spy plane is among the assets of the @entity45 of @entity4 , " @entity38 told reporters tuesday , according to the semi-official @entity42
" our country will decide what to do with it
" the @entity6 owes @entity4 an apology and needs to admit its crime , @entity4 @entity50 spokesman @entity49 said tuesday , the @entity54 report
" the @entity6 should know that what it did regarding violation of our air space can put international peace and security in danger , " he said
" the @entity6 should take responsibility for the consequences of the measure
" @entity6 officials have not confirmed that the drone shown in a video released last thursday by @entity4 media is a @entity6 aircraft
but @entity70 spokesman @entity69 has said that an @entity6 drone is missing and had not been recovered
two @entity6 officials have confirmed to @entity0 that the missing drone was part of a @entity76 reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in @entity79
@entity4 's official @entity80 said the country 's armed forces had downed the drone near @entity84 , some 225 kilometers ( 140 miles ) from the border with @entity79 on december 4
the @entity3 interview was aired in @entity2 monday night
officials say the fall of this drone is not related to an incident tuesday in which a @entity6 drone crashed upon landing at an airport in @entity93
for one thing , they seem to be two different kinds of drones -- the one over @entity4 was apparently a sophisticated stealth - type vehicle while the @entity93 one is of more conventional design .
