@entity0 , @entity1 -- the aunt of former @entity5 soldier @entity4 told jurors tearfully monday that " we did not send a rapist and murderer to @entity10 " as defense lawyers worked to save her nephew from a death sentence
former @entity5 soldier @entity4 has been convicted of raping and killing a 14 - year - old @entity10 girl
@entity16 , a @entity17 elementary school principal , told a civilian jury about @entity4 's childhood as a reader who loved to be hugged by relatives
" i do not know how we got to this spot , " @entity16 said in emotional testimony
" i do not know how this happened
" @entity4 was convicted last week in @entity26 in @entity1 of murder , rape , conspiracy and obstruction of justice in connection with a 2006 rape - and - murder south of @entity34
a jury found him guilty of raping a 14 - year - old girl , then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence
@entity4 also was found guilty of killing the girl 's parents and 6 - year - old sister
he could become the first former @entity5 soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court , where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light
four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover - up that followed
@entity4 faces either death or life in prison without the possibility of parole
his fate will be in the hands of the jury by week 's end
the defense has presented relatives and medical professionals who have pieced together a picture of @entity4 's childhood as troubled and stressful
it included the breakup of his parents ' marriage , routine beatings to the point of injury by an older brother and being moved about through @entity17 by his mother
@entity16 , the final witness scheduled by the defense , said that when the idea of the military came up for her nephew , she was unsure the @entity82 would accept him
even after he received a high school diploma through a correspondence course , she said , " i could not picture or imagine how he could make it through basic training
" @entity16 said when she saw a picture of her nephew before his september 2005 deployment , she knew he was n't " @entity95 " anymore , standing as tall as his father in the photo at @entity93 , @entity94
when he returned from @entity10 11 months later , he was " remarkably thin , " @entity16 said , and she noticed circles under his eyes
@entity4 and his father spent a night at the @entity16 home , his aunt said , and she remembered him pacing the yard while smoking
he fell asleep wearing his fatigues , she said
when asked by the defense about the rape - murder plot that left an @entity10 family dead near @entity106 , about 20 miles south of @entity34 , @entity16 responded , " he 's my @entity107
you ca n't stop loving someone
" there were other family members in the court on monday
@entity4 's father , @entity113 , an oil field worker from @entity115 , @entity17 , looked on quietly
@entity16 , who is @entity116 's sister , noted for the jury that @entity4 's mother is not at the trial this week
the mother is moving and had to attend a going - away party , @entity16 said
final arguments are expected wednesday .
