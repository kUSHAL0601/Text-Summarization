-- one of the few mysteries to have light shed on it in the search for a missing @entity6 airliner has been the case of two passengers who boarded the flight with stolen passports
the news that two @entity13 passengers were not who they claimed to be -- and had used stolen documents -- immediately raised speculation about foul play
authorities have not ruled out terrorism , but at least where it concerns these two passengers , early evidence indicates they were , foremost , @entity21 migrants
@entity23 secretary general @entity22 identified the two as @entity25 , 18 , and @entity26 , 29
he said they entered @entity28 using valid @entity21 passports , but they used stolen @entity32 and @entity33 passports to board flight 370
it is not uncommon for @entity21 to go to @entity36 , particularly @entity28 , @entity37 , deputy director of the @entity39 of @entity40 , told @entity0
after the violent 2009 - 2010 election protests in @entity21 , many @entity21 fled for @entity28 , where @entity43 , in most cases , can travel without a visa , @entity37 said
" a significant number of asylum - seekers from @entity21 did end up in @entity28 , " he said
acquiring stolen or altered passports , " unfortunately , is much easier than most people would think , " and quite common , @entity37 said
a @entity50 passport would be a great advantage for a migrant wanting to leave @entity36
authorities say the passports -- one @entity32 , the other @entity33 -- were stolen in @entity55 , which is a known hub of the stolen passport industry
" @entity55 remains a robust venue for the sale of high - quality false passports ( including altered stolen passports ) and other supporting documentation , " said @entity58 , who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years
according to @entity55 police , an @entity21 man by the name of @entity69 bought one - way tickets for the two men , describing them as friends who wanted to return home to @entity50
while @entity69 made the initial booking by telephone , either @entity69 or someone acting on his behalf paid for the tickets in cash , according to police
@entity23 's @entity22 said the evidence in the case of the stolen passports points to a concern quite different from terrorism : " if you read what the head of @entity28 police said recently , about [ @entity25 ] ... wanting to travel to @entity91 , @entity92 , to be with his mother , " he said , " [ this ] is part of a human smuggling issue and not a terrorist issue , " @entity22 said
human smuggling , which usually is linked to abuses such as forced labor or sex slavery , is a problem in @entity28 and other @entity36 countries
the suggestion is not that @entity26 and @entity25 were being exploited , but that there exists in @entity28 a criminal infrastructure for smuggling people .
