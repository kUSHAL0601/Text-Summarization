-- cat poop could be a " vast and underappreciated " public health problem , according to drs. @entity3 and @entity4
the pair on tuesday published a paper on the dangers of @entity9 oocysts , which are found in cat poop , in the journal trends in @entity12
in the journal article , @entity3 and @entity4 call for better control of the feral cat population and more research on the parasites
in the meantime , @entity0 asked the doctors how we can keep our families safe
@entity3 and @entity4 responded to the questions via e-mail
@entity0 : we 've heard that cat poop can be dangerous for pregnant women
should other people be wary , too ? drs. @entity3 and @entity4 : it is true that some cat poop contains @entity9 , a parasite for which cats and other felines are the definitive host
this parasite can affect the fetus if a woman becomes infected while pregnant
that is why pregnant women are warned against changing cat litter
it 's also well - known that @entity9 can cause major brain infections in individuals with @entity39 and other conditions associated with immune deficiency
chain of cat feces can harm humans , sea otters so what 's new ? recent studies suggest that individuals with disorders such as schizophrenia , obsessive - compulsive disorder , rheumatoid arthritis or brain tumors are more likely to have @entity9 antibodies than other people
there are also suggestions that @entity9 can affect memory and other cognitive function in people who are not otherwise ill. in no way have we established @entity9 as a cause of these disorders , but it has led us to rethink the possible risks of cat poop
@entity0 : how big of a risk are we talking about ? @entity3 and @entity67 : there are an estimated 82 million owned cats and another 25 million to 60 million feral cats in the @entity71 , and their numbers have increased markedly in recent years
based on studies done in @entity75 , it is estimated that these cats deposit 1.2 million tons of cat poop into the environment each year
at any given time , approximately 1 % of cats are infected with @entity9
the infective form of @entity9 deposited in cat poop are called oocysts ; a single infected cat can deposit millions of oocysts , each of which may survive in moist soil for 18 months or longer
it 's thought that it only takes one oocyst to infect a human , which is concerning
@entity0 : so what can people do to protect themselves ? @entity3 and @entity67 : it is important to note that cats that are always kept indoors are usually not a problem
almost all cats that become infected , and thus deposit infective oocysts , are outdoor cats
keep in mind cats are no respecters of property lines so a neighbor 's cat could deposit toxoplasma gondii oocysts in your garden or children 's play areas
weird science : kitty litter increases risk of suicide ? to stay safe , follow these suggestions : cat litter should be properly disposed of in the garbage , not flushed down the toilet where it can enter rivers and lakes
children 's sandboxes and play areas should be covered when not in use
cats selectively relieve themselves in areas with loose soil or sand
in the studies we reviewed , we found very high concentrations of @entity9 oocysts in these areas
if a sandbox has not been covered , the sand should be replaced and then kept covered
gardeners should wear gloves since gardens are another favorite place for cats to relieve themselves
one study reported that gardeners may have as many as 100 oocysts in dirt under their fingernails
vegetables from gardens should be thoroughly washed
