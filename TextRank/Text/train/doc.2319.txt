-- the current round of fighting between @entity3 and @entity4 will eventually stop
when it does , grieving and exhausted @entity4 and @entity6 will still be neighbors
the aftershocks of this war will reverberate not just in @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity4 , but also in the streets of @entity14 and @entity15 , in the cafes and living rooms of @entity18 , in the foreign ministries of @entity21 countries and in the meetings rooms of the @entity23
this war has exposed damaged nerves , deep prejudices and flawed policies
here are five places where we will see the impact after the fighting stops
@entity4 as @entity4 were taking cover from @entity3 rockets and the @entity11 - based @entity37 group announced it was also targeting planes flying in and out of @entity4 's main airport , a television anchor in @entity33 offered a most unhelpful suggestion
@entity42 , she said , should give nuclear weapons to @entity3 to fight @entity4
meanwhile , @entity42 's @entity44 reiterated his wish to see @entity4 wiped away
these messages remind @entity4 of the seriousness of their situation
@entity3 has no interest in a two - state solution
it is committed to obliterating @entity4
@entity4 do have disagreements regarding settlements and withdrawal from the @entity12
but when it comes to @entity3 , there is no question
the @entity3 charter reads : " our struggle against the @entity60 is very great and very serious
" as the writer @entity61 put it , leftist @entity4 now see that " the right wing 's fears are not mere paranoia , " and the right will see that there are limits to the use of force
this fight will erode the position of the extreme left and the extreme right in @entity4 , giving a boost to pragmatic advocates of security
the debate will revive calls to find other options and strengthen more moderate forces among @entity6 who have lost ground to @entity3
the imperative to find a new way forward with moderate @entity6 will re-emerge after frayed nerves cool
but an old obstacle has grown : @entity4 ' greatest fear is a @entity6 state falling to extremists , as @entity11 did to @entity3 , receiving weapons from @entity42 and others
there is no way @entity4 will now accept an armed @entity6 state within tunneling distance of its major cities , especially if @entity3 remains a dangerous player
@entity99 @entity3 ' bravado and its killing of @entity4 may give a popularity boost to the group
but @entity6 are pondering @entity3 's tactics
they will blame primarily @entity4 , no question , but they will take a look at the @entity3 strategy that resulted in so much death and destruction
@entity111 president @entity110 was one of the first to say it publicly
when @entity4 was warning @entity3 to stop the rocket fire that triggered a ground assault , @entity110 sounded exasperated
" what are you trying to achieve launching rockets ? " he asked @entity3 , adding , " we prefer to fight with wisdom
" with @entity3 fighters hidden in tunnels , drawing @entity4 fire to civilian areas , no matter how much you hate your enemy , is a tactic that warrants examination if not outright condemnation
in a stark shift from previous conflicts , criticism of @entity3 was widespread in @entity21 media
@entity133 journalists , in particular , fulminated against @entity3
@entity134 the suffering of the @entity6 population of @entity11 has been a heartbreaking aspect of this conflict , and it 's hardly surprising that it spurred protests , particularly in cities with large @entity143 populations
but what happened in a number of @entity134 cities in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , the @entity150 and elsewhere was something that goes far beyond a show of sympathy for the victims of war or a rejection of @entity4 's tactics
@entity134 saw some of the ugliest eruptions of blatant anti-semitism since the 1940s
critics of @entity4 often claim that @entity4 unfairly hides from critics by charging anti-semitism , but cries of " death to the @entity60 , " " slit the @entity60 throats , " or " jews to the gas chambers " along with the smashing and torching of @entity60 - owned shops and attacks on synagogues , have pulled back the cover , revealing anti-jewish sentiment that still runs deep , and in most cases remains unspoken in polite circles
we will find out how seriously @entity134 leaders address the matter now that we have found what lay hidden behind the curtain of civil discourse
@entity184 the @entity4 - @entity3 war has highlighted the emerging ideological and political alliances of a new @entity184
@entity187 and @entity188 have emerged as the champions of @entity3
their support for the @entity192 during the @entity193 became increasingly bold
now the two countries have become the defenders of @entity37 groups across the region , drawing the ire of other @entity21 governments
advocating for @entity200 in @entity11 is particularly beneficial to their political objectives , because the @entity6 cause draws popular support
that 's why @entity133 's decision to stand back is so remarkable
@entity133 under its new government has taken a firm stance against @entity3 and increasingly clashes with its supporters , particularly with @entity187
these political alliances complicate matters for the @entity212
@entity213 the fighting in @entity11 , with the dramatic pictures of @entity6 civilian deaths and thousands of rockets fired by @entity3 towards @entity4 civilians , has caused a diplomatic conundrum for @entity212
@entity4 is @entity213 's foremost ally in the region
but president @entity222 and prime minister @entity223 have disagreements
instead of taking a firm stance on @entity4 's side , the @entity213 has engaged in diplomacy with @entity188 , which supports @entity4 's deadliest enemies , and @entity187 , whose leaders have slandered and smeared @entity4
details of the diplomatic process , which amazingly excluded @entity6 moderates , have caused consternation in @entity4 , fury in @entity6 circles and disdain in @entity133
when the cease - fire comes , the @entity213 should review how it balances allies and their antagonists in times of crisis , because even after the shooting stops , this conflict is far from over .
