@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 and @entity1 military units exchanged gunfire near their border friday , @entity1 authorities said
the exchange happened after @entity4 forces fired two rounds from a 14.5 millimeter machine gun at a @entity1 military guard post near the border town of @entity15 , @entity1 , about 73 miles ( 118 km ) northeast of @entity0 , according to an official at the @entity17
the @entity1 unit responded with three " warning shots " from a .50 - caliber machine gun and warned the @entity4 guard post by loudspeaker to desist , the official said
the demilitarized zone at the location of the shooting is 1.3 kilometers ( 0.8 miles ) wide
@entity15 was the scene of heavy fighting during the 1950 - 53 @entity28
@entity4 on friday threatened to retaliate against its neighbor for shunning bilateral military talks
the gunfire exchange apparently wo n't cancel reunions of families separated by the @entity28 , which ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty
the weeklong reunions begin saturday at @entity37 , the two countries ' joint mountain resort in the @entity4
@entity4 has requested record shipments of rice and fertilizer in exchange for concessions on the reunions , the @entity1 @entity40 news agency reported earlier this week
while there are occasional shooting incidents across the demilitarized zones , the tensest flash point on the peninsula in recent years has been the disputed maritime border in the @entity53
there were fatal naval clashes there in 1999 and 2002
in march this year , the sinking of a @entity1 vessel killed 26 in what a @entity1 and international investigation team concluded was a @entity4 torpedo attack
@entity4 continues to deny involvement
the prickly relationship between the countries since the @entity28 has had periodic conciliatory moves and flare - ups
friday 's incident occurred two weeks before the @entity69 summit in @entity0
the @entity69 includes industrialized nations and developing economies , which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination
authorities said a total of 50,000 police and riot police will be deployed during the summit on november 11 and 12 , according to @entity40
