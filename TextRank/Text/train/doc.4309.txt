as @entity0 swept through @entity1 and emergency crews scrambled to rescue victims , @entity4 was responding to cries for help and offering words of comfort -- all in 140 characters or less
@entity4 runs the @entity12 's @entity11 account , which proved to be a lifeline of sorts for many stranded @entity1
she responded to hundreds of tweets pleading for help , most of them in the first hour or two after @entity0 made landfall
" you could see the panic and fear in the words they were typing , " said @entity4 , who stayed at her desk through the night
" people were so scared they were reaching out to anyone they thought might listen
it really struck a chord with me
i tried to help them as best as i could
" while hundreds of thousands of callers jammed emergency lines , @entity4 says , " a lot of people could n't get through to a 911 dispatcher
so i took their information and called our dispatchers myself to make sure they sent an emergency crew
" as the social media manager for the fire department , @entity4 says she always tweets out alerts to her 53,000 followers during emergencies
but this one was unique
@entity4 says she was prepared for the worst monday night , but did n't anticipate the hundreds of messages she received from terrified people unable to reach 911
at times , she said , the sheer volume of tweets was overwhelming , but under the circumstances she considered it part of the job
@entity4 used @entity11 to post updates on rising water levels from the storm surge , the broken crane dangling high above @entity59 and a fire that raged through the @entity62 section of @entity63 , destroying dozens of homes
what happened during those first few hours is still mostly a blur , she said , but she will never forget some of the frantic pleas
" one couple and their baby had moved to the second floor of their home because of floodwaters , " she said
" they were terrified the water would reach them
" as the night passed , the @entity12 @entity11 feed filled up with conversations between @entity4 and the city 's distressed victims
" my sis family at 78th @entity85 - 22 @entity84 , water rising 12 ft need help
1st floor drowned , kids scared , " @ rsindh tweeted
" @entity91 was notified , " @entity4 responded within minutes
" i know it 's difficult , but please be patient
" @entity4 , a 35 - year - old transplanted @entity93 who joined the @entity12 seven years ago to write for its website , stayed at her post from monday morning until 6 p.m. tuesday
she says one of her goals that night was to help keep people calm
" i reassured everyone asking for our help that rescuers would eventually reach them , " she said
her efforts have earned her a flurry of praise and media attention , with one headline calling her a " one - woman response team
" but @entity4 said the rescuers risking their lives were the real heroes of the storm
" i think the firefighters who were in 6 feet of water in @entity62 trying to put out those fires are the heroes
and the @entity118 members , who are going house to house in boats trying to save people in severe conditions , not knowing what they 're walking into -- they 're the heroes
" i was just sitting at my desk trying my best to keep up
and i did a very small part of what went on that night , " added @entity4 , who credits adrenaline and the energy of her co-workers with keeping her going through the night
" i was getting loopy toward the end of it and probably was n't making any sense whatsoever
" days later , @entity4 is still dealing with storm victims , some of whom apparently do n't realize she 's an army of one
" amazing to see the @ @entity12 using @ @entity11 to respond to emergencies , " wrote one @entity11 user
" i 'd love to see the behind the scenes of how that 's working
" for @entity4 , the most gratifying feedback has been follow - up responses from people who had sent her panicked tweets in @entity0 's terrifying early hours
they " let me know that they were rescued , " she said
" it was nice because you kind of sit there and wonder , ' did these people get help ? ' ''
