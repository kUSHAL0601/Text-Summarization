-- @entity2 's @entity1 has rejected an appeal by @entity5 laureate @entity4 to keep his position as managing director of the bank he founded
@entity4 founded the @entity9 three decades ago in what he said was an effort to alleviate poverty
@entity9 's work cast a global spotlight on microcredit , a then - novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans
for their efforts , @entity4 and @entity9 won the @entity22 in 2006
he also was awarded the @entity24 @entity23 and a @entity25
last month , the central bank of @entity2 -- the regulatory authority in the @entity29 nation -- cited the 70 - year - old 's age in explaining his removal as managing director
the government , which has a 25 % stake in @entity9 , said that the bank 's rules required @entity4 to end his service when he turned 60
the case wound its way to the @entity1 , which issued its ruling tuesday
lawmakers in the @entity24 , and in other countries , have asked the @entity2 government to find a compromise to bring an end to the @entity9 crisis
" the international community will watch this situation closely , and i hope that both sides can reach a compromise that maintains @entity9 's autonomy and effectiveness , " said sen. @entity48 , the chairman of the @entity24 @entity49 , last month
" institutions like the @entity9 make a significant contribution to @entity2 's development and democracy , and professor @entity4 ' life - long work to reduce poverty and empower women through microloans has deservedly received world - wide attention and respect
" @entity4 ' supporters have said the government 's effort to remove him has little to do with age and much to do with opposition to microcredit and @entity9 's execution of it
critics of microcredit have charged that lenders were making big money off of small loans
others have suggested that the actions against @entity4 are politically motivated , a claim denied by the government
@entity4 ' supporters say he has been under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim , unelected , military - backed government
that party was later abandoned
@entity87 , general secretary of the ruling @entity89 party , told reporters last month that the government wanted to resolve the issue " sympathetically , " but @entity4 had obstructed the process by going to the court
@entity95 , a former prime minister and now opposition leader in parliament , lashed out at the government for going after the nation 's only @entity5 laureate
" the move was designed to belittle @entity4 , who had earned prestige for the country , " she said
in a statement issued last month , @entity4 said he strongly believes @entity9 will continue to work to empower the poor , especially women in rural areas
" opportunity has to be created to hand over the charge of @entity9 in a happy environment so that it could achieve its objectives , " @entity4 said
" i am continuing the effort and it will go on until getting friendly cooperation from all
