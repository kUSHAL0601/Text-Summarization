-- this latest film from master filmmaker @entity2 will be both familiar to his fans and viewed as a departure
while it boasts a couple of his regular cast of performers ( including @entity11 for the first time in 21 years ) it is not an original story ( as most of his work is ) and is instead adapted by the director and his frequent collaborator , brother @entity18 , and based on a novel " @entity20 " ( " @entity20 " in the @entity21 ) by @entity22
it 's also significantly darker in tone , more subtle , wholly unsentimental and rather more brutal than we 're used to getting from @entity2
world famous plastic surgeon @entity26 ( @entity11 ) lives in an isolated compound called @entity28 , a magnificent mansion shut off from the world by trees , a wall and gates
in the compound 's laboratory @entity26 is experimenting on a new kind of skin , one developed through the gene therapy called transgenesis , an ethically - challenged procedure that has been banned by @entity26 's superiors
using pig cells , @entity26 has developed a new kind of human skin that can resist disease , fire and puncture but still transmits other sensations , like human touch
he 's achieved this by experimenting on humans , in strict violation of every ethical standard and contrary to the instructions of his medical superiors
one of these human subjects , a young and beautiful woman named @entity60 ( @entity61 , " @entity62 " ) , is his captive in the mansion and is @entity26 's latest guinea pig
@entity60 lives in a sealed room
her meals and other materials are delivered via dumbwaiter and her only contact with another person is when @entity26 is transplanting skin on to her or when he enters her room at night to give her some opium to smoke
@entity26 lives with a caretaker , @entity77 ( @entity78 , " @entity79 , " " @entity62 " ) , who is his willing accomplice in this macabre medical experiment and acts as a mother figure to him
she makes meals for @entity60 and is the only other person with whom she has any contact
@entity77 also dotes on @entity26 , whose tireless albeit creepy work was triggered by the death of his wife some years before , the victim of a horrible car crash and subsequent burning , hence the flam - resistant pigskin
she did n't die from her burns , however
in the process of being nursed back to health , she caught sight of her horribly disfigured form in a window reflection and immediately leapt from a window
as a result , @entity26 is intent on perfecting a method for healing burn victims
it all seems altruistic , but there 's something definitely ...
off about @entity26 and not just the beautiful young woman he keeps captive in his house
@entity2 is one of the most skillful and consistently magnificent directors of the last 30 + years and while " @entity115 " may be a bit of a departure from what his fans are used to , it is no less of a skillful and intriguing film
it is rife with the maestro 's deft touches of the bizarre rubbing up against the commonplace and the erotic is present where perhaps it is not expected
at the @entity124 , i took to referring to " skin " as more " @entity126 " or " @entity127 , " referring to @entity128 , whose own offering at this year 's @entity124 fest is also somewhat atypical of the most famous of his works
it is significantly darker than much of @entity2 's recent work and contains more than a couple of eye opening " wait
he did what ? " moments
alas , many of these moments come so deep into the film , that to allude to them could constitute spoilers
while it 's possible that some of you may see what 's coming , i did not and i will not deprive you of the singular joy that is a movie - provided " holy crap ! " @entity11 is nothing short of spectacular in what should prove to be a career resurgence for him
his @entity26 is all simmering emotion , everything below the surface
his is the quiet and determined countenance of the researcher , plying his trade tirelessly for the betterment of humanity ...
part of the irony given the subject matter of the film may be that he does n't look any older than he did 20 years ago
at the @entity124 where i screened the film , the common reaction of my fellow film goers when asked their thoughts on the film was something along the line of " i 'm not sure , yet
" it takes some time to digest , and i think it may perhaps be a film that with time does reveal its secrets and becomes that masterpiece
" @entity115 " is rated r and contains graphic violence , sexual situations , rape and some rather unsettling ideas surrounding revenge and psychopathy
it is distributed by @entity187 and opens on october 14th .
