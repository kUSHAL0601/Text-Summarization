-- there is little argument that @entity4 's respect in the @entity6 world has lessened as we enter our 10th year of war against a deadly shadow enemy of religious extremists who wear no uniform , wave no flag and who use their holy book as sword and shield against fellow @entity6 as well as all things @entity4
so what does @entity18 , pastor of the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , hope to accomplish by calling for a " @entity23 " this saturday , september 11 , the ninth anniversary of the worst sneak attack on @entity4 soil in our 234 - year history ? the answers are as obvious as they are ominous : he will bring total contempt from the world 's fastest - growing religion against the world 's oldest democracy
he will destroy the goodwill generations of @entity4 have worked to create in almost every nation
he will -- in just a few seconds of self - proclaimed glory and protest -- paint a target on the backs of @entity4 troops , diplomats , foreign service employees , humanitarian relief workers and @entity4 tourists
worse , still , @entity18 and his followers will provide our enemies with a propaganda tool that will outlast our lives and those of our children and their children
burning a quran will instantly undo everything good that @entity4 has done in the world
@entity4 's top general in @entity58 , @entity59 , recognizes the consequences of such an act
" images of the burning of a @entity54 would undoubtedly be used by extremists in @entity58 -- and around the world -- to inflame public opinion and incite violence , " he said in a statement released from his headquarters in @entity64
no one will remember when a half - dozen @entity6 nations joined a multinational coalition that included the @entity4 to free @entity73 back in 1991
no one will remember @entity4 's huge humanitarian response in @entity76 after the devastating 2004 tsunami or in @entity78 after this year 's disastrous flooding
no one will remember countless other projects to build schools and roadways and efforts to bring clean drinking water to people
no one outside the @entity4 will recognize or even care that burning a quran was the act of a single or small group of individuals
the only thing the @entity6 world will remember and our enemies will exploit is that the @entity4 government allowed @entity4 to burn the @entity97 holy book in protest without consequence
the @entity100 may protect the pastor 's right to protest , but nothing is to be gained and everything is to lose from this self - serving act
our nation was founded on religious freedom and tolerance , yet a man of the cloth wants to invoke memories of a not - so - proud history when a developing @entity4 did n't want @entity113 or @entity114 but did want slaves
if the good pastor wants to protest something on the side of the righteous , i would suggest he divert his energies against the rev. @entity121 and the @entity122 of @entity123 , @entity124
for the better part of this decade , @entity125 and his followers have been protesting around the country at the funerals of fallen military members , carrying signs that say " thank @entity132 for @entity133
" he is now the subject of a @entity100 case scheduled before the @entity4 @entity136 next month
[ @entity137 ] religion has been the rallying cry of almost every war in recorded history , and there are those in our country as well as in @entity6 countries who truly believe that this is the start of a war between @entity97 and nonbelievers
" @entity4 is not at war with @entity97 " is a statement that has been repeated publicly and repeated often by presidents and members of @entity153 from all political persuasions , not because it is politically correct but because it is true
@entity4 is at war , however , against a small number of religious extremists who hide behind women and children and kill indiscriminately without remorse
we must not allow an equally small number of religious extremists in @entity4 to widen the war by burning the @entity54 ... or @entity166 or @entity167
@entity4 is far better than that
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .
