-- @entity1 lived up to his star billing at the @entity3 with a tournament best 63 friday to put himself firmly in contention at the halfway stage of the $ 7 million event
the @entity8 has been followed by sizable and sometimes over enthusiastic galleries in @entity10 and was left frustrated by rain delays on the first day
woods returned early friday morning to play the final eight holes of this opening round , picking up three birdies before a late bogey left him on two - under 70
but after a short break the 14 - time major winner began to justify his appearance fee with stunning iron and approach play
he charged up the leader board to move to 11 - under , just one adrift of race to @entity29 leader @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32
" i 'm right there ; that 's the whole idea , " he told the @entity34 website
" got two more days of hopefully making a lot of birdies
" we know it 's going to take something really low
you 're going to have to go 20 plus probably to win this tournament , " he added
@entity28 , who formed a star studded trio with @entity1 and @entity48 champion @entity47 , backed up his first round 64 with a 68 , despite playing with an injured wrist
" it 's not in a great state
i have inflammation there , and i strained something else yesterday , as well before i teed off
" so it 's not in great shape and i 'm just hanging in there day by day and hope it keeps together for another couple of days , " said the @entity57
@entity30 , who is chasing @entity28 hard in the race to @entity29 , has had a pair of 66s with @entity66 and @entity32 of @entity67 firmly on the hunt on 132
@entity69 is also in the hunt in a big group at eight under , including fellow @entity72 @entity71
but most eyes will be on @entity12 , who is hunting his first win in a @entity34 event for four years to add to his five victories on the @entity78 this season to take him back to the top of the rankings .
