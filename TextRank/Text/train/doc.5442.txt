-- @entity1 was cruising across the @entity3 - @entity2 when a piece of steel and a giant cable crashed down
he was just 50 yards away
the @entity7 was just far enough away that he did n't see the debris as it fell
but he did see cars quickly move to the right lanes to avoid the mess
the falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity16 , as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities
it 's also forcing structural engineers to look at key questions around the nation 's infrastructure : has the nation done enough to address crucial bridges two years after the tragic collapse of a bridge in @entity29 that killed 13 people ? the answer , experts say , is no. the pieces that fell this week raise even more troubling issues because repairs had just been made in september to the same section of the 73 - year - old bridge , which spans the @entity38 and carries an average of 280,000 vehicles daily
over @entity42 , crews worked to repair a damaged steel beam
" the bridge has been inspected , and it is now safer than when we closed it , " @entity44 , the director of the @entity45 , said at the time
@entity50 , a structural engineering professor at the @entity52 , says he 's concerned that authorities took a " @entity55 " approach in september
" it failed , " he said
he 's worried about what he calls " fracture - critical " bridges : roughly 460 bridges across the country that are in dire need of repairs
" following the @entity29 bridge collapse , there was a lot of discussion because of emotions , " he said
" i did n't really see a sustained effort that says , ' we are going to replace these fracture - critical bridges
' " federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the august 1 , 2007 , bridge collapse in @entity29 that killed 13 people and injured 145
the gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the @entity81 over the @entity82 in @entity83 , according to the @entity84
a new bridge has since opened in @entity29 , what the @entity86 hailed as one of the nation 's @entity90 transportation feats this year
" it is critical that our transportation systems receive the funding necessary to keep @entity96 moving
but even more important is that our state and local governments use that money to deliver projects that quickly meet the needs of our communities , " @entity97 , the group 's executive director , said in a recent report
but engineers say that 's the problem : repairs are n't happening quick enough
if a tragedy like the @entity29 collapse does n't get people 's attention , they wonder , what will ? " i have seen some lip service , but i have not seen a lot of momentum and action , " said @entity114 , a professor of civil engineering at @entity52
" part of that is due to the economic recession
when @entity16 has a budget deficit of $ 25 billion , they do n't worry about bridges
they worry about closing the budget gap
" @entity128 , a civil engineering consultant based out of @entity2 , says the @entity29 collapse put critical bridge problems front and center before the @entity96 public
" in the engineering community , we knew these things many years ago , and there were requests for money , which was n't coming , " @entity128 said
but he says funding has n't kept up @entity139
according to a 2009 @entity143 report , more than 26 percent of the nation 's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete
the @entity86 estimated in 2008 that it would cost roughly $ 140 billion to repair every deficient bridge in the country
bridges are typically inspected every two years
" if we do n't start making substantial progress in five years , we will have more collapses , " @entity114 said
the @entity2 opened in 1936 and spans 8.4 miles
it was the largest and most expensive bridge -- $ 77 million -- of its time
the bridge is best known to most @entity96 from the 1989 @entity154 earthquake
a 50 - foot section of the bridge collapsed during the quake , killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake - tolerant
part of the bridge , the @entity163 , is a suspension bridge
the other portion of the bridge , known as the @entity167 , is a truss - cantilever design
this week 's falling debris happened on the @entity167 , which is in the process of being replaced .
