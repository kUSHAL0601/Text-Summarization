@entity0 -- every issue in the @entity4 wrongful death trial is so disputed that even giving candy to jurors caused an argument
@entity9 lawyers gave a bag of peppermint candy to the bailiff to hand out to the jury this week
even @entity14 -- the pop icon 's mother -- enjoyed the treat
but @entity4 's lawyer raised an objection tuesday afternoon , suggesting jurors might be influenced if they realized the source of the sweets
each side can provide snacks for jurors , but they 'll be placed at the bailiff 's desk before jurors enter court so they have no clue who brought it
while the candy controversy might seem trivial , the stakes are high for @entity9
the promoter and producer of @entity4 's comeback concerts could be found liable for billions of dollars in damages if the jury decides the company is responsible for the star 's death
@entity9 execs face questions about @entity4 's death @entity4 's mother and three children are suing @entity9 for the negligent hiring , retention or supervision of dr. @entity51 , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity4 's death
the candy argument may be the most interesting thing about tuesday 's proceedings , unless you are a student of employment law and budgeting
@entity9 senior vice president / general counsel @entity59 was on the stand for a second day hoping to give testimony that would convince the jury that @entity51 was chosen , hired and supervised by @entity4 -- not his company
@entity51 never had an executed contract with @entity9 , although one had been negotiated
the doctor signed it and returned it to the company on june 24 , 2009 , but the @entity9 executive decided not to sign it after @entity4 died the next day
@entity4 lawyers contend @entity51 was already on the job , working under an oral agreement confirmed by a series of e-mails that promised him $ 150,000 a month to be @entity4 's full - time physician
with @entity59 on the stand , @entity4 lawyer @entity79 played part of an interview that @entity9 president @entity9 gave to @entity84 television soon after @entity4 's death
" this guy was willing to leave his practice for a very large sum of money , so we hired him , " @entity9 said
@entity79 also showed jurors an e-mail between @entity9 lawyers suggesting that @entity9 told other interviewers @entity9 " hired " @entity51
@entity4 's manager 's e-mails found , could be key in @entity9 trial trouble at the front the @entity4 lawyers argue that @entity9 executives ignored a series of " red flags " that should have alerted them that @entity4 needed help as he prepared for his comeback concerts
earlier testimony from @entity4 's makeup artist , choreographer and an associate director described his failing health and mental condition in the last two weeks of his life
@entity79 asked @entity59 about e-mails titled " trouble at the front " between @entity9 executives and people working on the production starting on june 19 , 2009 -- a night that show director @entity119 sent @entity4 home because of his strange behavior
" he was a basket case and @entity119 was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage , or worse yet -- get hurt , " production director @entity122 wrote to @entity9 top execs @entity9 and @entity124
" the company is rehearsing right now , but the doubt is pervasive
" @entity9 forwarded the e-mail to his boss -- @entity132 -- at @entity9 's parent company , with the comment : " we have a real problem here
" @entity4 had missed a number of rehearsals and the " @entity138 " tour debut was just three weeks away in @entity140
@entity141 calls @entity4 ' a pedophile ' @entity119 , in an e-mail previously reported , told @entity9 that same morning -- five days before @entity4 died -- that he did not think he would be ready for the shows
" i honestly do n't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state , " he wrote
@entity119 described seeing " strong signs of paranoia , anxiety and obsessive - like behavior " with @entity4
" i think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist to evaluate him asap
" even @entity155 , a former @entity4 advisor and lawyer who had just been rehired , weighed in with advice in an e-mail : " i have the right therapist / spiritual advisor / substance abuse counselor who could help ( recently helped mike tyson get sober and paroled ) ... do we know whether there this is a substance issued involved ( perhaps better discussed on the phone
) " does @entity59 consider that exchange a " red flag " that @entity9 should have noticed , @entity79 asked
" i would take it seriously , as i believe mr. @entity9 did , " @entity59 answered
" i do n't know i would use the word ' red flag
' " @entity171 called a meeting the next afternoon with @entity51 at @entity4 's home
afterward , he sent this e-mail to @entity119 : " @entity119 , it is critical that neither you , me , or anyone around this show become amateur psychologists or physicians
i had a lengthy conversation with dr. @entity51 , who i am gaining immense respect for as i get to deal with him more
he said that @entity4 is not only physically equipped to perform and that discouraging him to , will hasten his decline instead of stopping it
dr. @entity51 also reiterated that he is mentally able to and was speaking to me from the house where he had spent the morning with @entity4
this doctor is extremely successful ( we check everyone out ) and does not need this gig so he totally unbiased and ethical
" the @entity193 ' lawyer called this e-mail " a flat out lie , " since @entity9 had not done a background check on @entity51 before hiring him -- and if they had it would have disclosed that he was in deep debt and not a successful doctor
" we did not do a background or credit check on dr. @entity51 , " @entity59 conceded
witness : ' everybody was lying ' after @entity4 died no due diligence the @entity4 lawyers contend that @entity9 is liable for his death because they did not do their " due diligence " by checking @entity51 's background and credentials
if they had done so , they would have realized that @entity51 had a major conflict of interest that made him vulnerable to break rules in his treatment if @entity4 , they argue
@entity51 needed the high - paying job because he was more than $ 1 million in debt , his home was being foreclosed on , he was being sued for unpaid child support and delinquent taxes , and his cardiology clinic in @entity220 faced eviction
his $ 150,000 a month job would end if @entity4 's shows were canceled or delayed , according to the terms of his contract
@entity9 failed to conduct the background check , which the company 's own expert witness said would between cost between $ 40 and $ 125
" i am not familiar with the process of doing background checks , " @entity59 said
" @entity59 is back on the witness stand wednesday for questioning by @entity9 lawyer @entity234
the trial , which is in its fourth week in a @entity0 courtroom , is expected to last through july
choreographer : @entity9 considered ' pulling the plug ' on @entity4 's comeback
