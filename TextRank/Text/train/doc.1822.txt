-- @entity1 has long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts , but newly released @entity7 documents officially acknowledge the site and suggest that the area served a far less remarkable purpose than many had supposed
according to these reports , which include a map of the base 's location in @entity16 , @entity1 was merely a testing site for the government 's @entity18 and @entity21 aerial surveillance programs
the @entity18 program conducted surveillance around the world , including over the @entity25 during the @entity26
@entity1 , about 125 miles northwest of @entity27 , is synonymous in popular culture with government secrecy , and many have theorized that it holds the answer to one of the greatest questions plaguing mankind : are we really alone in the universe ? but the newly released documents make no mention of alien autopsy rooms or spaceship parking lots
this information will be disappointing to some , who have come to view the area as a mecca of sorts for alien encounters
for these true believers , the existence of alien spacecraft at @entity1 , and the government 's attempts to cover up their trace , is irrefutable and has been since reports of @entity54 -- or @entity54 -- began to emerge from the @entity16 desert in the middle part of the 20th century
the map and other documents were released in response to a @entity61 request submitted by @entity62 , a senior fellow at the @entity63 , in 2005
@entity62 submitted the request as part of his continuing study of aerial surveillance programs and told @entity0 that he was not given an explanation of why the new documents were less redacted than previous versions declassified by the agency
he points out , however , that the location of @entity1 was not a particularly well - kept secret
its location appears in books on aerial surveillance and is widely referenced in popular culture
in fact , the map that was released in the @entity7 documents mirrors the one that appears after a simple @entity83 search for " @entity1
" @entity1 has also been referenced in government documents in the past , though this newest release is the first that acknowledges its existence and location in a purposeful way
@entity62 told @entity0 he believes this could signal a dramatic change in the government 's willingness to declassify information about the famed base , meaning even more information could come out about @entity1 in the future
the release of these reports seem to put the theories about aliens and flying saucers to rest for the time being , although they may not be enough to silence the true believers
at least they still have @entity104 , right ?
