-- the former director of a @entity3 - area cemetery where hundreds of graves were dug up and resold has pleaded guilty to several charges involving the desecration of human remains
@entity9 , 51 , who ran the @entity10 when the allegations surfaced in 2009 , was sentenced to 12 years in prison friday after she pleaded guilty to all charges against her , including dismembering a human body and theft from a place of worship , according to state prosecutors in @entity19 , @entity20
three grave diggers face charges
as part of the scheme , prosecutors said , the grave diggers would exhume bodies , crushing vaults and caskets before dumping human remains at the cemetery 's trash site
the workers would " double stack " graves , meaning they would bury existing remains deeper into the ground before placing new remains in the same location , authorities said
towns " is very remorseful , not only for the pain she caused her family , but the families of people who have loved ones at @entity10 , " defense attorney @entity46 said , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity47
" she accepted responsibility for the allegations in this case , and she would just like to put this behind her and move on with her life
" weeks after the investigation began , the @entity57 issued a statement clarifying that first lady @entity61 's late father , @entity60 , was not buried in @entity10 , but in a graveyard a few miles away
the first lady 's communications director had mistakenly reported he was buried in @entity10
the @entity65 received more than 5,000 telephone inquiries and 1,700 e-mails regarding missing relatives , throughout their investigation
at the time , sheriff @entity70 said the scene at the cemetery was disturbing
" i found bones out there , " he said
" i found individuals wandering aimlessly looking for their loved ones who ca n't find them
" the investigation also extended into " @entity78 , " a section of the cemetery intended for children
@entity82 said he talked to countless women who could not find their children
authorities also discovered the original glass - faced casket belonging to 14 - year - old @entity88 , piled in a garage filled with lawn care equipment
thousands rallied behind @entity88 's family after he was violently murdered in august 1955 for reportedly whistling at a white woman
his body was exhumed in 2005 following a renewed investigation into his death
he was reburied in a new casket
groundskeepers told investigators @entity88 's body was not disturbed , but the rev. @entity101 told reporters the desecration of his original casket was very painful .
