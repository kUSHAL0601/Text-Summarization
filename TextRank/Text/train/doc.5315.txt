winter is the season to come down with colds
awful , sniffling , sneezing , muscle - achy colds
we know cold weather has something to do with this
or do we ? we spoke with two experts -- dr. @entity8 , chief of the dr. @entity10 at @entity11 , and dr. @entity12 , vice president and senior medical director of the @entity14 in @entity11 -- to find out the truth once and for all
the rumor : cold weather causes colds why is winter the common - cold season ? it 's a common perception that when the weather gets colder , we tend to get sick more
this is why we bundle up in warm clothes before facing the elements : we want to protect ourselves against frigid weather because we do n't want to catch colds
the verdict : cold weather does not cause colds according to @entity8 , it is n't actually the cold weather that causes the common cold , it 's what we do when it gets cold out
" when the weather turns cold , " she says , " we all run indoors , where air is recycled and we 're often in close quarters with other people and viruses
we all sneeze on top of each other
" this is why the cold season is the same -- though maybe not as severe -- in warmer climates like @entity46 as it is in colder ones like @entity11 or @entity49
" @entity50 and cold conditions are probably more high - risk situations for viruses because of dry mucosa , " adds @entity8
the mucosa , she says , is what lines your trachea , the back of your throat and your sinuses
viruses invade the mucosa and start growing , causing your cold
and that 's viruses -- as in , plural
the common cold is n't just one type of virus : when you say " i 've got a cold , " that could mean you have one of many bugs
" there are a variety of different cold viruses , " says @entity12 , " ... so it makes sense that there is no one therapy to treat a cold
" the strength of our own immune system also plays a big part in how susceptible we are to colds , and how severe they might be
" the extremes are the young babies , the older adults , those with underlying medical conditions , " explains @entity8
" but even those who take low - dose steroids -- those people do n't make as many antibodies , and the cells that are supposed to fight infection are not as well equipped to do that
so when they do get a cold , it 's more severe
we 're all susceptible , but what may be a 24 - hour cold for me may be a week ( of illness ] for somebody else
