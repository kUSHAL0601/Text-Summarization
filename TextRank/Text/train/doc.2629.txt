the @entity6 was located 300 miles ( 483 km ) from @entity7 , an island nation a few hundred miles from the coast of western @entity9 , said @entity1 defense minister @entity10
the crew " is alive and well , " he said

" the questioning aims to clarify all circumstances of how the ship disappeared and why did it not send any [ emergency ] signals
" the @entity6 , which sails under a @entity23 flag , had not been heard from since july 31
it was carrying a 6,500 - ton cargo of timber from @entity27 to @entity28 when it reported trouble on july 24 off the coast of @entity31

at the time , @entity1 's ambassador to @entity7 , however , denied that the @entity6 had been spotted near the island nation
on july 24 , the ship 's 15 - member crew had told authorities that eight to 12 people armed with guns and pistols boarded the vessel about 3 a.m. that day , masked and wearing uniforms with the word " police " written on them , the @entity51 said
" during [ the attackers ' ] stay onboard , the members of the crew were allegedly assaulted , tied , gagged and blindfolded and some of them were seriously injured , " the maritime authority said in a written statement
@entity31 police reached the ship by phone on july 31 and spoke with someone they believe to be the captain , police spokeswoman @entity70 said

on saturday @entity27 police told @entity2 that a ransom demand had been issued to the ship 's owners , @entity86 , for the return of the vessel .
