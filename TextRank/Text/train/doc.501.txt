@entity0 -- an angry crowd lingering near the @entity4 embassy in @entity0 after an attack on the building a day earlier turned on journalists reporting the incident saturday , accusing at least one of being an @entity4 spy
as a @entity1 crew filmed the embassy from across the street , another crew from @entity13 public television -- led by @entity15 television producer @entity14 -- approached the building
the crew 's @entity22 cameraman was preparing to film the embassy when a woman in the crowd began hurling insults at the tv team , @entity20 said
" there was this older lady who decided to follow me and rally people against me , " @entity20 recalled
" she said ' you 're a spy working with the @entity13
' then they swarmed me and i was a target
" a growing crowd surrounded @entity20 and her colleagues , as they tried to leave the scene
@entity38 , a producer working for @entity1 , rushed to help @entity39 through the angry crowd
but suddenly the two reporters were pinned against the railing of an overpass by young men who were accusing @entity20 of being an @entity4 spy
@entity46 " i 'm @entity15 , " @entity38 managed to pull @entity20 another 10 meters down the road , until the pressure from the mob overwhelmed the pair
@entity20 screamed as she and @entity38 were knocked to the ground and the crowd started to trample them
other @entity1 journalists tried to reach in to help , but were pushed back by a wall of angry men
@entity38 lay on top of @entity20 , shielding her with his body
" i was thinking , how powerless i was because there was no police to save us , " @entity38 said
" i was worried that they were going to rape her
" at that moment , a student bystander named @entity67 called out to the journalists and pointed out a nearby car
somehow , @entity38 managed to carry @entity20 to the open door of the public television crew 's car , where two of her female colleagues were waiting just a few feet away
the mob pounded on the windows and tried to reach into the vehicle as the panicked reporters fumbled and struggled to get behind the steering wheel
when @entity81 , a correspondent with the @entity83 program " @entity84 " managed to get the vehicle moving away from the crowd , men threw stones at the departing vehicle
@entity20 had few words to describe the terrifying ordeal
" they were animals , " she said
other @entity15 journalists told @entity1 they were also attacked saturday while trying to report near the @entity4 embassy
@entity94 , a correspondent with @entity15 state television , said he was pursued by civilians and soldiers
" i had to run because obviously they were targeting journalists , " @entity94 said in a phone call with @entity1
" they attacked two other tv crews
" " i was in the car getting ready to film
a soldier knocked on the window with his stick and said ' if you do n't leave by midnight your car will be destroyed , " " said @entity104 , a video journalist with the @entity106 newspaper @entity105
journalists have been targeted before in @entity0
on february 2 , dozens of journalists of different nationalities were beaten and pursued around the city while trying to report on @entity118 demonstrations
the day descended into one of brutal street violence , as pro-regime supporters backed by men on horses and camels attacked opposition demonstrators on what became known as the " @entity127
" and @entity129 correspondent @entity128 suffered a brutal sexual assault in @entity131 while covering the celebrations that followed former president @entity134 's resignation on february 11
on saturday , as some journalists ran for their lives from the @entity4 embassy , the interim government was holding crisis talks with @entity15 's ruling military council and top intelligence chief
the emergency session concluded with a pledge to honor @entity15 's international treaties and defend foreign embassies
the government also announced plans to re-activate the country 's 30 - year - old emergency law
application of the law had lapsed since the overthrow of @entity134 , according to a senior official in the @entity154 , who spoke to @entity1 on condition of anonymity
one of the five measures announced after saturday 's crisis talks calls on authorities to make " media and political powers accountable for inciting security lapses
" " it 's obvious that there is some sort of plan leading to military rule in this country , " warned @entity15 state tv 's @entity164
" the next step will be martial law
