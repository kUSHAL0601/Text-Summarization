-- veteran golfer @entity1 took advantage of a remarkable collapse by long - time leader @entity4 to win the @entity5 for the second time at @entity7 and @entity8 sunday
the 42 - year - old @entity9 posted a two - under 68 in testing conditions on the links course in @entity12 to go into the clubhouse on seven - under 273 , but @entity14 's @entity4 still looked set to claim his first major title
however , a disastrous run of four straight bogeys from the 15th saw the 32 - year - old finish one shot adrift of former world @entity21 , who won his fourth major title and his first since claiming the @entity5 in a playoff in 2002
son 's autism gives veteran star @entity1 added spur @entity4 , who had led by four shots going into the final round , pulled his tee shot on the 18th into a bunker , but a fine third left him with an eight - foot putt to force a playoff
it went agonizingly wide of the hole to leave him with a final - round 75 and his hopes of glory cruelly dashed
by contrast , @entity1 finished with a birdie on his final hole and had been on the practice putting green preparing for a possible playoff
he had immediate words of sympathy for the beaten @entity48
" first of all i feel for @entity4
he is a great friend of mine , " he said
" we both wanted to win very badly but it 's the nature of the beast
" a stunned @entity4 , who had started the day four shots ahead of @entity56 @entity55 and @entity57 of @entity58 , admitted he had blown it
" i 'm pretty disappointed
i had it in my hands and managed to hit a poor shot on each of the closing four holes , " he said
" but i played so beautifully for most of the week i certainly should not let this get me down
" the expected challenge from @entity67 petered out after he made a triple bogey on the par - four sixth
he eventually carded a three - over 73 to end three under alongside playing partner @entity55 in a tie for third
@entity57 , the 2010 @entity70 champion , also disappointed and fell away with a 75 to tie for fifth at two under with @entity72 's world number one @entity73 , who raced up the leaderboard with a 69
@entity1 is the 16th different winner of a golf major in a row , but it looked an unlikely scenario when he was six behind @entity4 after dropping two shots to the turn
but he picked up birdies at the 10th , 12th and 14th before his last - hole flourish to put the pressure on the @entity14 , which eventually paid dividends
@entity1 has slipped down the world rankings in recent years and did not qualify to play in this year 's @entity87 at @entity88
he had gone without a win in 36 major starts since his 2002 @entity5 triumph at @entity92 , but had never lost faith
" it was my time for some reason , " @entity1 said
" a lot of people never thought i would win another one
i started believing this year
" he is the same age as last year 's surprise @entity101 @entity5 winner @entity100 , who missed the cut in his title defense .
