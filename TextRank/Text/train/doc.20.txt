@entity0 -- a day after the @entity3 published a blacklist of alleged @entity6 human rights abusers , whom @entity0 slapped with personal sanctions , the @entity2 answered with a list of its own
it slaps alleged @entity3 rights violators with similar sanctions , official @entity6 news agency @entity10 reported saturday
the @entity3 list is part of a december 2012 law , the @entity15 , which imposes visa bans and freezes assets of @entity6 officials believed to be connected to the death of whistleblower @entity6 lawyer @entity20 , who uncovered the country 's largest known tax fraud
@entity3 releases blacklist tied to alleged @entity6 rights abuses @entity20 was allegedly beaten to death in detention , a claim which @entity6 authorities dispute
the new law has been a thorn in the side of @entity32 , which banned @entity3 adoption of @entity6 children shortly after it passed
@entity0 's blacklist , published friday , contains 18 names
the @entity6 list also contains 18 and is a conscious , incensed reply to the @entity3 list
@entity6 news agency @entity39 published the names of @entity3 on @entity32 's list
it includes an @entity43 agent , a @entity45 agent and officials at a @entity48 district court
" this war of lists was not our decision , but we do not have the right to ignore such open blackmail , " @entity6 's foreign ministry said in a statement according to @entity10
it accused the @entity3 of basing its relationship with @entity6 on " mentorship
" @entity0 's blacklist includes people said to be linked to the @entity20 case , including senior officials in the @entity6 interior ministry , prosecutors , judges , prison officials and tax officers
the people on @entity6 's mirror list have a connection to the @entity3 detention camp in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity10 reported
it also includes @entity3 who were allegedly " involved in the abduction and removal to other countries of @entity6 citizens and in threats to their lives and health
" more on the @entity15 an additional , classified list , which was submitted to the @entity82 , includes people who are subject only to the travel ban
other blacklisted names were tied to other high profile cases
one was accused in the 2006 shooting death of a @entity89 man who filed claims against @entity32 with the @entity91 in @entity92 for human rights violations in @entity89
the other is believed to have played a part in the 2004 murder of @entity3 @entity97 , the editor of @entity100 ' magazine 's @entity6 edition , in what was viewed as an attempt to quash investigative journalism in the country
a senior @entity106 official told reporters the list was the product of an investigation based on information from non-governmental organizations and other information made available to the @entity3
the official said the rigorous standards used to develop this list were similar to those used to designate individuals and companies on other @entity3 blacklists
additional names would be added to the blacklist , should more information become available , the official said
absent from the list were certain @entity6 officials close to president @entity126
but the senior @entity106 official said " political considerations " in the @entity3 relationship with @entity6 were " not a factor " and that additional names could be added to the blacklist , should additional information become available
@entity6 reactions president @entity126 's spokesman , @entity133 , said friday that the @entity3 blacklist would have a " very negative effect on bilateral @entity6 - @entity3 relations
" but he appeared to play down the long - term impact , saying ties between @entity32 and @entity0 were multifaceted and still had potential for growth
@entity6 's foreign minister , @entity140 , warned friday that the publication of the list risked overshadowing the visit of national security adviser @entity144 , who is scheduled to visit @entity32 on monday
" the choice of timing was not entirely favorable , " @entity140 said , considering @entity144 's visit is meant to address the broad aspects of the @entity3 - @entity6 relationship
if the list is published , we will react and our @entity3 partners know that
