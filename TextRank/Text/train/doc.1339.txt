in @entity2 on wednesday , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 vowed that the @entity1 and a " broad coalition " of nations would help @entity5 fight @entity7 militants
his visit comes hours before president @entity9 will address @entity1 about his strategy for combating the terror group
@entity2 is @entity0 's first stop on a regional tour to enlist @entity15 support for a global coalition to defeat @entity7
after meeting privately , @entity5 's new prime minister , @entity18 , and @entity0 spoke before reporters
" we are fighting these people ( @entity7 ) , " @entity18 said
" of course , our role is to defend our country , but the international community is responsible to protect @entity5 and protect @entity5 in the whole region
" what 's happening in @entity28 is coming across to @entity5 , " he said
" we can not cross that border
it is an international border , but there is a role for the international community for the @entity34 to do that ... and of course for the @entity1 to act immediately to stop the spread of this cancer
" he said @entity5 have worked hard recently to come together and form an inclusive government where " everybody 's on board " to fight the militants
@entity7 has said they 're bent on creating an @entity44 caliphate in @entity5 and @entity28 where harsh @entity46 law governs every aspect of life
@entity0 first congratulated @entity18 on working in record time to form a solid government
" your comments today and your description to me in our private meeting of the steps you 're prepared to take , not only with respect to ( @entity7 ) and your own military commitment to reconstitute itself and to take the fight to ( @entity7 ) ... this is really important from the international community " perspective , @entity0 said
he said @entity9 will lay out a detailed description of what the @entity1 is prepared to do , in a " broad coalition " with " many other countries to take on this terrorist structure which is unacceptable by any standard anywhere in the world
" @entity9 is open to conducting airstrikes in @entity28 to combat the @entity7 terror group , @entity1 officials told @entity74 on wednesday
but it 's unclear whether he will announce any such plan in his televised speech wednesday night
read the latest news about @entity9 and @entity28 in a separate news conference wednesday in @entity5 , @entity0 said the @entity1 is already coordinating with some 40 other nations to provide humanitarian , military and other assistance to @entity5 to fight @entity7 militants
the @entity1 has so far launched more than 150 airstrikes to weaken @entity7 militants in @entity5 , @entity0 said
on wednesday , a @entity1 military attack aircraft conducted a strike in support of @entity89 ' defense of @entity90
the strike destroyed one @entity7 armed vehicle in the vicinity of @entity90 , the military said , and the aircraft left the strike area safely
' the hard work is far from over ' @entity0 said that while he finds it " encouraging " that @entity5 are coming together so quickly to form a government , " it does n't mean much if it is n't able to govern inclusively
" critics of former prime minister @entity102 accused him of consolidating power and persecuting political rivals , blaming him for fueling @entity5 's problems with sectarian policies that alienated @entity107
" the hard work is far from over , " @entity0 noted
" in many ways , it 's just beginning
" @entity5 must strengthen its security forces , he said
in the face of @entity7 attacks , some @entity5 soldiers simply ran from their posts
on the security front , @entity0 said that @entity5 leaders have decided to establish locally rooted security structures that will be integrated into @entity5 's national force
doing so would be " key " to " guaranteeing @entity5 's territorial integrity , " he said
@entity122 plans to accelerate the formation of those local units at his first @entity126 meeting this week , @entity0 said
@entity0 said that @entity9 asked him to visit @entity5 not just to build a coalition and talk with @entity5 , but also to " underscore to the people of @entity5 that the @entity1 will stand by them in this effort
" he called @entity7 a " vicious " organization that is " the single biggest threat " to the country
stressing that the fight against @entity7 will be long , @entity0 said monday that the @entity1 would assemble a coalition " built to endure for the months , and perhaps years , to come
" taking fight against @entity7 ' to the next level ' senior @entity138 officials traveling with @entity0 said the appointment of the new government would kick - start a strategy the @entity9 administration began this summer to combat @entity7 , including increasing intelligence gathering in @entity5 , assessing the @entity5 military capability and launching strategic airstrikes at @entity7 targets , which the officials say have blunted the group 's momentum
" that was really critical to set a baseline foundation in the event additional decisions were made , " one senior official said
" we 've come a long way since then , based upon this plan that we really put in place in june , and we are now at the stage of beginning to take it to the next level
" @entity0 's visit comes " under circumstances in which there are real opportunities , " the official said
" certainly the road ahead is daunting , " the official said
" but to get to this point is significant ... there is a chance now
" @entity9 called @entity18 on monday to congratulate him on the formation of the new government
@entity2 was the first stop on a regional tour to enlist @entity15 support for a global coalition to defeat @entity7
in a statement , the @entity175 said that in his call with @entity9 , @entity18 " expressed his commitment to work with all communities in @entity5 as well as regional and international partners to strengthen @entity5 's capabilities " to fight @entity7 militants , made up largely of @entity107 jihadists
broadening the @entity186 coalition as @entity0 leaves @entity5 , @entity9 will address @entity1 about his diplomatic , military and economic campaign to defeat the group , which has captured large swaths of @entity28 and @entity5 and has beheaded two @entity1 journalists
videotaped beheadings , including two murders of @entity1 journalists , have led to the push for a broader counterterrorism mission , including possible airstrikes in @entity28 , where @entity7 has a haven
the @entity1 has ruled out sending @entity1 troops for a ground offensive
@entity9 has been reluctant to take military action against the group in @entity28 , which could indirectly help president @entity204 's regime
but @entity175 spokesman @entity205 said the president was willing to go " wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening @entity1
" after leaving @entity2 , @entity0 's diplomatic drive will center on building regional support for a global coalition to combat @entity7
he will meet with @entity211 in @entity212 on wednesday before traveling thursday to @entity213
in the seaside town of @entity215 , @entity0 will meet with the leaders of six @entity218 nations
in addition to support for a military campaign against @entity7 , administration officials said the @entity1 would be looking to its @entity218 allies to crack down on @entity7 funding and stop the flow of foreign fighters , both seen as the lifeblood of the jihadist group
the @entity1 also wants @entity228 , particularly @entity213 , to counter @entity7 ' narrative and persuade other @entity107 to eschew its ideology
" it 's going to be a very difficult , long road to get there , but it 's something that the region and our partners in the @entity218 can play a really important role in , " a senior @entity138 official traveling with @entity0 said
" and there 's a number of different ways that they can do that , both in terms of just their relationships , in terms of their encouragement , in terms of their financial contributions , in terms of lifting the burden that the government here has
" after @entity213 , @entity0 will travel to @entity253 to attend an international conference on @entity5 , @entity138 spokeswoman @entity252 said
@entity9 will chair a meeting later this month at the @entity257 , where the global strategy is expected to be hammered out .
