@entity0 -- the seasoned @entity3 operative president @entity2 tapped last week to head his administration 's @entity5 fight got to work on wednesday , though @entity8 's new job is expected to unfold out of public sight
the so - called " ebola czar " -- termed an " @entity19 " by the @entity10 -- will meet with @entity2 and other top advisers wednesday afternoon in the @entity12 to discuss the global crisis , which has @entity14 worried about their own safety and skeptical of the government 's ability to respond
@entity8 's appointment last week was meant partly to quell public anxiety about the virus
the announcement came after calls from lawmakers to name a central organizing " czar " that could ensure the various health arms of the administration were working in concert
@entity2 initially resisted , saying his top homeland security aide @entity31 was doing a sufficient job in managing the response alongside her other tasks , which include a major role advising the mission against @entity37
but on thursday -- the same day lawmakers slammed the administration 's ebola response during a @entity42 hearing -- the president conceded he may need someone to manage the effort fulltime
he named @entity8 to the role friday , though the @entity10 said it took until this week to complete the required paperwork to get him started
he was spotted at the @entity10 on saturday evening , though he did n't attend a high - level @entity12 meeting on @entity5 that took place around the same time
@entity8 's appointment was met with suspicion from @entity52 , who pointed out the former lobbyist and vice presidential chief of staff lacked any medical experience
but @entity10 officials say @entity8 was picked because of his knowledge of the vast federal bureaucracy and his ability to pull the strings of government
" what we were looking for is not an @entity5 expert , but rather an implementation expert , " press secretary @entity62 said last week
the @entity10 says @entity8 wo n't be his own boss ; he 'll report both to @entity68 and national security adviser @entity69
and the @entity10 made clear last week @entity2 himself bears ultimate oversight for his administration 's actions
as such , aides say @entity8 's new job coordinating various federal agencies wo n't be public - facing , though they have n't ruled out putting him in front of cameras to address the government efforts
