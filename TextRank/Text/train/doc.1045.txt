-- getting hired or promoted in today 's competitive environment is no easy feat. but , then again , neither was our pitch for @entity5
the rules of the game were made clear : whichever advertising campaign had the best consumer test score would be declared the winner and awarded the @entity5 account
yet , despite the fact that our now famous " @entity5 " campaign did not fare well in testing , we won the business , and the rest is history
fifteen years later , " priceless " remains one of the most recognizable ad campaigns in recent history
so why did we win the business , defying set rules and what early testing said would be a failure ? according to @entity5 's @entity29 @entity28 , it was because of our " core " -- we were a fighting and a cohesive team of competitors , who believed with every ounce of our beings that this campaign would crush their long - standing competitor , @entity38
in other words , we had tapped their " hidden agenda
" the hidden agenda is the unspoken , visceral , emotional motivation that is behind every decision
whether deciding who wins the billion dollar deal ... or the job , the hidden agenda is always at work
your mission is to connect to it , and here 's how : do your hidden - agenda homework it 's not enough to know factoids about the company
do your homework about the emotional state of the company
are they on a high , yet searching for the next big thing ? are they in crisis and in need of a turnaround ? are they guided by a value system that drives the decisions they make ? it turns out that every decision stems from a hidden agenda , which can be found in three forms : â € ¢ @entity76 are about people viewing their circumstances through the lens of ambition and confidence
â € ¢ needs are about viewing circumstances through the lens of fear or concern
â € ¢ values are about people viewing the world entirely through the lens of their belief systems
in addition to understanding the company 's hidden agenda , study the person who will be interviewing you to determine their hidden agenda
connect with your real ambition i had breakfast a few weeks ago with a very compelling young man
this electrifying fellow was exuberant , quirky bordering on eccentric , and without pretense
he spoke of what he hoped to create in his life , and i hired him on the spot
your real ambition is a deep desire to create something special that does n't yet exist
it 's bigger than mere ambition because it 's noble
when the person you are trying to reach is touched by your real ambition and makes common cause , they 'll hire you
try this : think about what you want to accomplish , but precede with the words " i will ... " make sure it is seemingly impossible , devoid of practicality and utterly fantastic
you can create a shared bond with your interviewer , because they see you both share a common vision
see also : is happiness the secret of success ? bond with your credo a company is many things , but it is a community first
each community has a set of values that bind them ; i call it a credo , @entity143 for " i believe
" dig deeply and look behind the facts and figures
what does the company you 're applying to believe ? if you want to be part of it , know it and connect yourself to it
try this : take out a sheet of paper , and write " i believe that ... " what words would you select ? what values would you express that would make you proud for others to see ? connections are made because of the beliefs you share
you 'll be hired , because your interviewer will see that your credo syncs perfectly with theirs
ignite with your core your core is what makes you stand out from the pack
while many people have similar traits , your core is comprised of a set of skills , abilities , and strengths that , together , are completely unique to you
and as was the case with @entity5 , your core will be seen as something the company needs -- the " answer to their prayers " and a means by which you can help them
see also : is workplace boredom ' the new stress ? ' critical to your core is authenticity
as a wonderful mentor once told me when i was presenting what i thought was a perfect version of myself and thinking that the real me was no road to glory : the person you are is the person they want to see
they are hiring you , not a manufactured version of something or someone else
try this : ask five people who know you well and support you to write down the key characteristics they associate with you
not only will you be staggered by what you 'll get , but you will also feel proud and affirmed
you mobilize people to hire you , because their vital needs are satisfied by the authenticity and sincerity of your core
your pursuit for the promotion or job of your dreams is not a fact and figures game -- it is a human game
when you make a profound connection with the emotional desire of your boss or interviewer , the facts and figures will take the backseat , every time
