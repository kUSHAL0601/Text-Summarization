@entity0 -- the @entity2 is training people to hack into its own computer networks
" to beat a hacker , you need to think like one , " said @entity5 , co-founder and president of the @entity8 , or @entity8
his company was chosen by the @entity2 to oversee training of @entity2 employees who work in computer security - related jobs and certify them when the training is complete
the @entity2 does not consider this hacking
" @entity2 personnel are not learning to hack
they are learning to defend the network against hackers , " said spokesman lt. col. @entity21
but the @entity8 calls the program " @entity26 certification
" the purpose of the training is to teach @entity2 employees to defend their computer network
almost 45,000 attacks on @entity2 computers were reported in the first half of 2009 , according to a government report
the report estimated that for all of 2009 , the number of attacks would be up 60 percent from the previous year
fending off the attacks costs the @entity2 about $ 100 million
@entity5 said the training focuses on teaching the art of hacking , using the same tools and tricks that traditional hackers use to break into computer networks
the basic concept is @entity2 employees would use the training to hack into the department 's computers , @entity5 said
once the ethical hackers find the vulnerabilities that unethical hackers could use to attack , they increase the security to remove the potential threat
he said they are like bodyguards for the @entity2 network
their only goal is to defend the network , even if the means of doing so are similar to those used by cyberattackers , @entity5 said
this kind of training has been done before in the @entity2 on an ad hoc basis , said @entity5
now every @entity2 agency and unit is required to include hacker training as one option for employees involved in cybersecurity
@entity8 has 450 training partners that will handle standard " ethical hacking " training , which has been used by civilian agencies and private businesses for years
if a @entity2 agency wants its employees to focus on a particular type of hacker training , @entity8 will perform customized training
the training requires 40 hours of instruction and 4,500 pages of reading on the latest hacker techniques
@entity5 said that @entity2 employees who complete the training and certification will not be assigned to use their new knowledge to hack into privately owned or civilian computers
but he said that any kind of training , including ethical hacking , could be used for nefarious purposes
" you can teach me to cut an apple with a knife , and i can turn around and stab you with the knife , " @entity5 said
@entity8 will be paid a fee per student , between $ 450 to $ 2,500 depending on the extent of the training and certification
it wo n't be clear for months exactly how many students will be trained .
