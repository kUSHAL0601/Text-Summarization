-- after a difficult past year , @entity1 is back where he feels most comfortable -- but his rivals are battling to find form ahead of the @entity5
while the @entity6 cruised into the quarterfinals of the @entity9 tournament he has won for the past eight seasons , world no. 1 @entity11 again had to come from behind to earn his place while @entity13 suffered a crushing defeat that will demote him to third in the rankings
fourth seed @entity16 and no. 5 @entity18 also crashed out thursday to thin out the competition for @entity1 as he continues his winning return to the @entity21 following longterm knee problems
his 6 - 2 6 - 4 rout of @entity26 16th seed @entity24 was his 16th successive victory this year following a defeat in the final of his comeback event in @entity32 in february
" i feel more relaxed , yes
i had some uneasy moments during the past year , " @entity1 said after his 44th consecutive win at the clay - court event , which set up a clash with 21 - year - old @entity37 @entity36
" now i 'm back on the tour
just being here is good news
and winning matches -- i say it every day , but winning every match is very important to me today
every time i have the chance to go on court and play well , feel competitive , is a really good feeling
" @entity36 is also on a roll , having followed up his opening victory over world no. 10 @entity52 by beating @entity26 's @entity53 6 - 2 6 - 4
" really looking forward to that match , " said @entity36 , who reached a career - high 31st in the rankings last month
" even for now i 'm very excited
" i 'm feeling quite good coming on court with ( the top players )
i feel also physically i 'm ready to kind of hang with them more as the match goes on
" i know tomorrow is another point of view , since clay court you 're playing against the greatest of all time
there 's that feeling and anxiety that you want to come out and do the best you can
i think most of all you have to keep a good composure
" @entity13 is seeking to restore his composure after being beaten in less than an hour by @entity70 , a result that will see the @entity74 13th seed 's absent compatriot @entity72 return to no. 2 in the rankings
" when i started making a lot of errors he was able to dictate all of the points from there , " said @entity13 , who made 24 unforced mistakes as he missed out on a possible semifinal against @entity1
" i 've played some good tournaments here but it does take me time to feel comfortable on the surface
i need matches against top players to see what 's going wrong and going right and the things i need to work on to get better
" no - one wants to lose matches like that
hopefully i can use it as motivation to improve because i really need to do a lot of work
i need to work really hard over the next two weeks to get ready for @entity96
" last year the @entity99 capital 's experiment with blue clay proved unpopular with most players , and it was banned for this season
@entity11 was one of the most vocal critics , but this year he is focused on his fitness problems after battling to beat @entity105 4 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 2 on thursday
" it 's another big test obviously , again a two - hour match , " said the @entity106 , who injured his ankle on @entity110 duty earlier this month
" obviously i 'm not physically feeling my best
somehow feels that i always miss that half a step
after i lost the first set today , i tried to find that inner strength
so that 's a positive thing
every day brings a new challenge and we 'll see what happens tomorrow
" a two - time runnerup in the principality , @entity11 -- who could again meet @entity1 in the final -- will next face @entity18 's conqueror @entity126
the veteran @entity128 triumphed 6 - 4 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) against the 2009 @entity130 champion as he was taken to a tie - break in the decider after the @entity133 saved a match - point , before reaching his first masters - level quarterfinal since 2006
@entity16 lost 6 - 4 6 - 2 to 32nd - ranked @entity137 @entity136 , who earned his first masters - level quarterfinal appearance -- a clash with @entity142 seventh seed @entity140
@entity140 , a semifinalist in @entity143 last month , beat @entity145 ninth seed @entity146 7 - 5 6 - 4
@entity70 , meanwhile , will next face world no. 8 @entity147 , who defeated @entity150 @entity149 6 - 3 6 - 0 the day after the @entity142 's 28th birthday
" to beat @entity13 that easy was a big surprise , for sure , " @entity70 said
" i 'm playing really good , really strong , really confident with my game
he 's playing slow , he 's playing from the baseline , he 's not putting so much pressure
for me on clay , it 's perfect
