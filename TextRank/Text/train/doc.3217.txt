-- alaskans were shaken up -- but not , it seems , rattled -- by a 6.2 - magnitude earthquake and more than a dozen aftershocks that struck in the state thursday
the @entity6 noted that the biggest tremor struck at 9:51 a.m. local time ( 1:51 p.m. et ) , centered some 80 miles northwest of @entity9
its large magnitude was balanced out , somewhat , by how far down it occurred -- 64 miles deep , according to the @entity6
" normally , we do n't have large magnitude quakes this deep , " said @entity13 seismologist @entity12 , noting that the tremor was felt strongly in @entity14 and as far south as @entity15
" because it was that deep , it did n't cause as much damage as a shallower quake
" still , it was big enough to create messes and cause scares in the state dubbed @entity26
pictures on @entity0 affiliate @entity29 's website showed a toppled bookcase and strewn papers in a lawyer 's office , hair supplies toppled onto a @entity36 's floor , as well as cracked walls and floors
the @entity39 tweeted out a picture of students huddled under tables in a library as a damaged ceiling panel dangled overheard
@entity45 , principal of @entity9 's @entity39 , praised his students for doing " great duck , cover , and holding ! " " what a shaker this morning ! " @entity45 tweeted
" ... some small damage that will be repaired
" @entity52 reporter @entity51 tweeted that he was on the sixth floor of an @entity9 courthouse when the earthquake struck , noting that one employee there noticed " desks were bounding , chairs were rolling around
" and afterward , crews from @entity62 's @entity61 had to clean up some debris and rocks that fell onto the @entity65 while thursday 's quake may have been big -- and , according to @entity9 police spokeswoman @entity68 , abnormally long -- it did n't come as a total shock
" normally , we have around 100 earthquakes in @entity62 each day , " said @entity12 , the seismologist
@entity0 's @entity74 contributed to this report .
