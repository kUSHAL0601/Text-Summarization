-- it has been nearly four weeks since @entity2 went to the polls and the country is still drifting rudderless without a functioning government
this week , political leaders are holding two days of crucial talks with @entity2 's ceremonial president of the republic , @entity8
the talks began wednesday morning and are expected to conclude at 6 p.m. thursday in @entity11
@entity2 's february elections were inconclusive , and have created a political gridlock that is hobbling the country 's economy
the nation is currently in its longest recession in 20 years
it 's economy -- @entity20 's third - largest with a government debt the @entity22 puts at $ 2.6 trillion -- shrank by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 , @entity19 says
after the elections failed to produce a government , international ratings agency @entity24 downgraded @entity2 's credit rating from a- to @entity29 + and warned of further risks if political uncertainty continues and reforms and austerity measures are stalled by a lack of a functioning government
@entity2 's hung parliament met for the first time on friday , when ministers began the process of electing leaders of the lower house and the @entity42
@entity43 , 51 , a former journalist and spokeswoman for the @entity45 of the high commissioner for refugees , won a strong majority as the speaker of the lower house
@entity50 , 68 , an anti-mafia magistrate from @entity51 , became the speaker of the @entity42
at a news conference tuesday , @entity43 and @entity50 pledged to push through legislation that would cut salaries and benefits for members of parliament by 30 %
@entity2 lawmakers are among the highest paid in all of @entity20 , according to a @entity19 poll in 2011
" we are asking for the same kinds of sacrifices to our pay that @entity2 are suffering through the recession , " @entity43 told @entity0 by telephone
but @entity2 is still lacking a functioning prime minister
none of the country 's top leading parties currently has enough support to lead the country single - handedly , and none of the leaders have so far showed a willingness to form a grand coalition or support each other 's candidates for the prime ministerial role
@entity8 said at a news conference tuesday afternoon that during this week 's talks he will first attempt to persuade leaders to support @entity82 of the center - left @entity83 as prime minister
@entity82 fared the best in the february elections by leading a leftist coalition to a small majority in the lower house of parliament
but he was unable to win a majority in the @entity42 , where it counts
instead , power in the @entity42 was divided between @entity82 and former prime minister @entity96 's center - right coalition , anchored by his party , @entity97 , or @entity97
@entity82 and @entity96 are arch - rivals who have indicated they will not work together
@entity82 's platform included judicial reforms that reverse legislation passed when @entity96 held office , including expanding statutes of limitations on financial crimes and stripping political leaders of immunity
@entity96 is currently awaiting a verdict in a trial in which he stands accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex on more than 13 occasions and abusing his office to protect her in an unrelated crime
the verdict is expected to come in early april
last year , @entity96 was convicted of tax fraud
last month , he was convicted of publishing illegally acquired wiretaps in his brother 's newspaper
he is appealing both convictions
@entity96 has indicated that he does not agree with @entity82 's judicial and criminal reforms and that he would not work with the center - left as long as those items are on the agenda
the election deadlock has meant that @entity127 , a former comedian and political revolutionary who led his grass - roots @entity130 to third - place in the elections by promising to get rid of @entity2 's tired politicians and traditional political parties , would be the key to power if he were to support one of the traditional parties
but since the elections , he has refused to work with either @entity82 or @entity96 , resulting in the political gridlock
he has said no to a political or technocratic government , leaving little room to negotiate
@entity127 , continuing to rebuff @entity82 's attempts to work together to form a coalition , friday called @entity82 " dead man talking
" but his own party is showing some fractures
a dozen of its members in parliament voted against the party 's candidates in the elections last weekend to choose the parliamentary leaders
@entity127 , who is not a member of parliament and did not run for office , lambasted his unfaithful party members on his personal blog
@entity160 , who led @entity2 in a technocratic role after @entity96 resigned under pressure in november 2011 , did not win enough support in the february elections to bolster either side , and his austerity platform is not seen as a draw for support
he has been acting as prime minister since the election produced no winner , but he threatened to walk off the job last weekend during the debate over electing the parliamentary leaders
saturday , @entity8 asked @entity160 to stay on in his caretaker role until a government can be formed
" it is important for @entity20 , and to exercise whatever initiatives are possible and necessary , especially for the economy and jobs , the government remains under the authoritative leadership of @entity160 until a new government is formed , " @entity8 said in a written statement
@entity8 's intervention meetings on wednesday and thursday will either confirm @entity82 as a prime minister or produce a technocratic leader who will guide the country forward to inevitable early elections , likely either in june or next autumn
to further complicate matters , @entity8 's mandate as president ends on may 15
in accordance with @entity2 's electoral law , the president can not dissolve parliament or call new elections with less than six months left in office
that means that either with or without a prime minister , @entity2 's hung parliament must begin the process of electing a new president to replace @entity8
that process will start on april 15 with the nomination of candidates , a step subject to a fair amount of backroom horse - trading
@entity96 recently said in an interview on his @entity212 television network that he would consider agreeing to @entity82 as prime minister if his center - right ally , @entity214 , were elected president of the @entity216
other presidential candidate names mentioned by members of parliament in interviews with the @entity2 press include @entity160 and respected @entity224 leader and former @entity225 member of parliament @entity226 .
