a man who spent more than half his life in a @entity3 prison for two murders he did n't commit walked out a free man friday , holding his belongings in two white plastic bags
@entity9 , who was wrongfully convicted in 1978 , said he feels wonderful about his freedom
he is now 70 - years old
@entity9 was exonerated by a three - judge panel who reviewed post-conviction dna evidence from the victims
the panel said that evidence excluded @entity9 as a suspect
a witness who testified that @entity9 had admitted to the murders recanted his testimony in 2013
@entity20 and her daughter @entity21 were discovered in september 1976 inside their home in @entity24 , @entity3
the women had been beaten and stabbed multiple times ; @entity21 had been sexually assaulted
man freed by dna evidence after 20 years dies a year later the day before the women 's bodies were found , @entity9 had escaped from @entity31 , approximately 4 miles from the victims ' home
he had been serving a four - year sentence for larceny
@entity9 was picked up after he was spotted in @entity36 , @entity37 , driving a stolen car , arrested and brought back to @entity3 , where he was charged with two counts of first - degree murder in the deaths of the @entity42
at trial , the state presented forensic evidence linking @entity9 to the crime
two inmates also testified against @entity9 , saying he had admitted to the crimes behind bars
he was convicted and sentence to life in prison
@entity52 frees @entity3 's longest - serving death row resident during the more than three decades @entity9 was in prison , he maintained his innocence , filing numerous post-conviction motions on various grounds
all were denied without hearing
in 2003 , however , his request for new dna testing was granted ; testing began five years later
the @entity61 took on investigating @entity9 's case
it in december found " sufficient evidence of factual innocence to merit judicial review
" speaking to reporters outside the @entity69 jail , @entity9 said , " when you 're conscious of something you did n't do , you can live with yourself
it 's between you and your maker
" the family of @entity20 and @entity21 expressed their disapproval with the panel 's decision
@entity79 , @entity20 ' granddaughter , reading from a prepared statement , said , " we , the family , are heartbroken by this decision
" @entity9 , who was wrongly incarcerated for 37 years , addressed the @entity86 family directly , saying , " i 'm very , very sorry for your loss
i hope you get closure in this matter
" the commission , which began operating in 2007 , is the first of its kind in the country , and is separate from the appeals process , according to the organization 's website
a person exonerated by the commission process is declared innocent and can not be retried for the same crime
