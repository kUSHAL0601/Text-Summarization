-- @entity1 returned to the top of the @entity3 with a 3 - 1 victory over in - form @entity5 on saturday but the champions ' title hopes suffered a blow with the news that top scorer @entity10 may miss the rest of the season
the @entity14 striker sat out the home win , which put @entity1 two points clear of @entity17 , with a groin injury suffered in training and he may miss the final two matches of the season
@entity14 coach @entity21 will be hoping that @entity1 take no risks with the 34 - goal forward , who will be one of his key players at the @entity26 in @entity27 starting in mid-june
" i think he 'll probably take two to three weeks to recover , " @entity1 manager @entity28 told match broadcaster @entity29
" we 'll try to get him back , he 'll obviously be desperate to get back himself
we 'll just have to wait and see
" earlier this month , @entity10 made a sooner - than - expected return from an ankle injury to play in the second leg of the @entity36 quarterfinal against @entity37 , then missed the 0 - 0 draw with @entity39 before a below - par outing in the 1 - 0 win over @entity42 that kept his side in the title race
@entity1 face mid-table @entity46 and @entity47 in the climax to the season as the club seek a fourth successive league crown , while @entity17 hosts @entity47 on sunday before a trip to @entity53 and a home clash with lowly @entity55
@entity5 , who upset third - placed @entity57 and @entity17 in the two preceding matches , have not beaten @entity1 since 1989 and have not defeated one of the " big four " away from home in 66 matches
@entity64 's team still retained fourth place in the table as @entity42 drew 0 - 0 at @entity57 in saturday 's late match
the @entity68 looked like matching @entity1 at @entity69 when defender @entity70 equalized in the 70th minute , but @entity72 midfielder @entity71 snatched victory for the hosts with a delightful chip on 81 and then won a penalty for @entity78 ' second spot - kick of the game five minutes later
the 36 - year - old @entity78 had never scored a penalty in his near 600 - game career for @entity1 , but coolly took over @entity10 's duties in the 58th minute after @entity83 brought down @entity84 in the box
@entity1 lost @entity84 to the lingering effects of his pre-match illness and winger @entity88 went off with injury , while @entity5 rallied with the return of @entity14 midfielder @entity91 from long - term injury as a substitute
defender @entity70 headed in @entity96 's corner as @entity1 fullback @entity97 strayed from his position on the post and could not clear the ball to give the visitors hope of a point
but @entity71 raced onto substitute @entity104 's pass to beat goalkeeper @entity105 with an exquisite finish , and the @entity107 was again beaten by @entity78 after a clumsy challenge from behind by @entity109
@entity42 trail @entity5 by a point in the battle for the fourth @entity36 place , with the two teams to meet in their penultimate game of the season on may 5
city boss @entity117 surprisingly left @entity118 on the bench after the @entity122 striker 's ill - advised goal celebrations in front of his former club 's fans when the teams last met in the league in september
@entity118 made an impact when he came on in the second half , but the match was most notable for a season - ending shoulder injury suffered by @entity42 's @entity133 goalkeeper @entity132 that allowed @entity135 to become the first @entity136 to play in the @entity3
the 23 - year - old was largely untested as @entity57 's faint title hopes were finally extinguished , with the @entity68 now seven points behind @entity1 with two matches left
@entity141 may have to fill in for the rest of the season , with @entity132 's deputy @entity144 injured and @entity14 international @entity145 on loan at @entity147
@entity42 next take on sixth - placed @entity148 , who can keep their own @entity36 hopes alive with victory at home to @entity153 rivals @entity147 on sunday
@entity154 moved six points clear of the relegation zone with a 3 - 2 win over fellow strugglers @entity55 that keeps @entity160 's team in the top flight for another season
captain @entity163 struck a 77th - minute winner from long range as @entity154 recovered from an early own - goal by @entity168 defender @entity167 , with @entity107 striker @entity169 and @entity171 midfielder @entity170 putting the @entity173 side 2 - 1 up at halftime
@entity176 striker @entity175 leveled seven minutes after the interval with a bundled effort as @entity179 flicked on a cross from first - goal provider @entity181 , but @entity170 headed against the bar before midfielder @entity163 celebrated his return from suspension with a fine winner
the result sent third - bottom @entity188 down to the second division after the @entity191 side lost 1 - 0 in an ill - tempered home clash with @entity46 that saw both teams reduced to 10 men
@entity195 put @entity46 ahead in the seventh minute from close range after strike partner @entity197 headed @entity199 's cross into his path for the @entity14 @entity26 hopeful 's 25th goal this season
@entity188 should have leveled after the club 's former defender @entity204 brought down @entity206 , but @entity207 hit the post with his penalty attempt
@entity199 was sent off just before halftime following an ugly exchange with @entity188 striker @entity211 , which saw the @entity213 receive a headbutt after throwing the ball in the face of the @entity168 international , who was also red - carded
@entity219 will be safe for a second season in the @entity3 if fellow promoted side @entity222 fail to beat @entity53 on sunday , having moved eight points clear of the second - bottom side with a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity39
@entity39 captain @entity227 put the visitors ahead in the 28th minute , with the @entity230 defender diverting in @entity232 's corner , but substitute @entity233 headed an 81st minute equalizer from @entity236 's cross
relegated bottom club @entity237 came from two goals down to earn a 2 - 2 draw at @entity240 , as @entity242 striker @entity241 netted a second - half double for the @entity245 finalists to cancel out first - half efforts by @entity247 and @entity248 .
