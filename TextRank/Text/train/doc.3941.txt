" @entity2 gov. @entity1 , right , with president @entity7 last week in @entity8 , @entity2
the nation 's first legally blind governor is facing approval ratings dipping below 20 percent
" i 'm blind but i 'm not oblivious , " he said sunday on @entity13 's " @entity12
" " i realize that there are people who do n't want me to run
" last sunday , the @entity16 reported that the @entity4 was urging @entity1 to withdraw
the @entity4 neither confirmed nor denied that to @entity0
but informed sources told @entity0 that @entity4 political director @entity18 met with @entity1 to let him know about the administration 's concerns he could not win the governor 's race next year
that loss could affect races down - ticket , including the @entity27 seat now held by @entity28
" i have spent a whole life being told i could n't do things
i was told by guidance counselors i should n't go to college , " @entity1 said on sunday
" i was told when i was minority leader of the @entity27 that we could n't win the majority
we won eight seats in four years and won the majority
" the governor also noted that a court this week upheld his appointment of a lieutenant governor , disproving those who said it would not be upheld
the message to him , @entity1 said , " was that you do n't give up
" in the @entity13 interview , @entity1 left his descriptions vague about discussions with the @entity4 , saying he would not detail " confidential conversations
" he said " the president has never told me not to run for governor " and that he 's " never gotten an explicit indication authorized from the @entity4 that i should n't run
" " they certainly sent a message that they have concerns
and i appreciate that , " he said
he acknowledged that it has been " a difficult week
" asked about his wife 's remarks to the @entity62 that he had been " stunned " by the message from the @entity4 , @entity1 responded , " @entity64 is very protective of me
i do n't know that i was stunned
" " i am not failing to stand up for my party -- i fight for the priorities of my party , " he said , adding that he is " fighting for the people of the state of @entity2
... so i 'm not going to run away from a fight when i know who i 'm fighting for
" throughout the interview , @entity1 cited the economic crisis and his need to cut $ 30 billion in spending
he said the cuts have brought on " a hail of criticism " from special interests , " and that is what accounts for the low poll numbers
" one of only two @entity83 governors , @entity1 said he does not believe race has been a factor in the poll numbers
@entity1 was lieutenant governor when a scandal led to then - gov. @entity88 's departure from the office in march 2008 .
