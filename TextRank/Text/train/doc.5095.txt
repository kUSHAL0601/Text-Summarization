-- shortly after 10 a.m. @entity1 sent a text to his daughter @entity3 , a junior at @entity4 in northeast @entity5
he could feel the lump in his throat as he warned her : you have three minutes to get to a safe place
the twister was hurtling straight toward her
it was one of two apparent tornadoes that ripped through the area friday
@entity1 jumped in his car and furiously drove the three miles from his home to the school
in his read view mirror , he could see four police cars
but they were n't chasing him
they were also charging towards to the school and the sitting targets within
@entity1 arrived to a surreal scene wrought by the fury of the storm
his heart skipped a few beats
he was one of thousands of @entity31 unnerved friday by a swath of severe weather that extended from @entity34 to @entity35
inside the school , it was hot , damp and dark -- the power was out
the staff had gone into storm mode at about 8:45 in the morning , huddling the students in the safest place of all , the hallway , @entity1 said
@entity3 was huddled with her classmates
she could feel her frightened friend 's clawing into her arm
everyone knew the tornado coming their way , like a killer approaching a helpless victim
@entity3 was 20 feet away from the door and could feel the wind forcing its way underneath
it was so strong that even through the cracks , it made her hair fly
" we did n't know if it was going to bust open at any minute , " she said
signs outside were blowing ; trees bending
suddenly , it became sunny
the wind went one way one minute and another , the next
then , it began raining
the pressure changed and got so bad it made @entity3 's ears hurt
she got low to the floor
a large trash bin flew through the air
where once there had been tall oaks , there was nothing
they were horizontal with the earth and @entity3 could see the house that used to be hidden by vegetation across the street
when it was over , teachers screamed as they saw their wrecked cars , the building 's windows shattered and part of the roof in the parking lot
similar storms ripped through the @entity5 area about a year ago
students , teachers and parents all had their memories
@entity3 had even chased tornadoes with her dad -- both father and daughter are fascinated with science and meteorology
but she had never lived through a tornado before
now she knew what it felt like
" it was a whole different experience , " she said
" i could n't even text
my hands were shaking so bad
" many of the students were trying to call their moms and dads but cell phone service was sketchy
she was relieved to see her father when he arrived at the school
@entity1 said his daughter 's friends pleaded with him
" please , mr. @entity1 , " they said
" but he could n't
school policy forbade it so that all the students could be accounted for
" it was heartbreaking , " he said
" it was horrible in there
they were so scared and apprehensive
" @entity1 felt incredibly lucky that everyone he loved was alright
he took his daughter home and passed the rest of the day under a tornado watch .
