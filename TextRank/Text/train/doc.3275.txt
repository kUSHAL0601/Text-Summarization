@entity1 president @entity0 met with @entity2 privately friday amid media speculation over his alleged affair with an actress
@entity0 also plans to meet @entity7 secretary of state @entity6 and @entity1 clergy while in @entity9
hours before he arrived at the @entity7 , a small bomb exploded in central @entity9 near a @entity1 foundation and @entity1 cultural center , police said
the blast damaged three cars and broke windows in two nearby buildings , said @entity18 , a spokesman for @entity21 's military police , or @entity22
there 's been no claim of responsibility for the bomb
it 's unclear whether its detonation is linked to the visit by the @entity1 president
@entity0 's private life has been the subject of global headlines since claims in the @entity1 magazine closer of a two - year affair with actress @entity37
the allegations of an affair have left the position of the president 's partner , @entity41 , in some doubt
it 's not clear whether she will accompany @entity0 on a state visit to @entity47 next month
@entity0 and @entity41 are working to issue a " clarification " concerning their relationship , @entity41 's attorney , @entity48 , told the @entity1 daily newspaper @entity52 in an interview published late thursday
after the alleged love affair , @entity41 " truly wants to resolve the matter in order to come out of it in the most dignified way possible , " @entity48 told @entity52
@entity41 has been @entity0 's partner for several years
last weekend , she left the hospital where she 'd spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue , @entity64 magazine reported
the same magazine -- where @entity41 is a longtime correspondent -- said saturday that she would recover for " several days " in an official residence in @entity67
@entity0 may hope his visit to @entity9 will help improve his standing in @entity1 , a majority - @entity70 country
his relationship with many @entity72 was damaged by a bruising battle last year over the passage of a law allowing same - sex marriage and adoption
the measure was one of @entity0 's election pledges
the @entity72 in @entity1 opposed the legislation
many of the faithful joined huge marches in protest against it , but they were unable to stop it from becoming law
nationwide , @entity0 has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election in 2012 , although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life
a recent survey by @entity1 pollster @entity97 with @entity1 newspaper @entity99 found that more than 80 % of respondents had not changed their opinion of the president based on the allegations of an affair .
