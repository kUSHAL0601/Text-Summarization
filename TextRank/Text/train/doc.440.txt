-- there once was a man named @entity3 who did n't know what to do with himself -- not just sometimes , but always
he slogged through school , then the @entity6 and pre-beatles @entity7 on a scholarship
he shipped off to a foggy , wretched spot in @entity11 in the @entity12 , and returned to a slightly less - wretched @entity14 basement
he became an architect -- the very same job his father and brother held -- and , feeling a bit burned out by 1960 , secured a grant to write a kids ' book about cities
but those old demons grabbed him , the ones that always seem to keep him from doing the things he should be doing , and @entity28 began to write a story
his very first sentence : " there once was a boy named @entity34 who did n't know what to do with himself -- not just sometimes , but always
" the sentence became a chapter , then pictures drawn by his friend and neighbor , cartoonist @entity41 , and eventually , a book
the book became " @entity46 " -- perhaps you 've read one of the 4 million copies printed during the last 51 years
in it , uninspired young @entity34 receives a mysterious tollbooth that takes him through the @entity34 ( a city of sorts , with landmarks such as the @entity52 and the @entity53 ) to rescue the princesses @entity55
along the way , @entity34 learns a bit about language , friendship , learning itself , and those very same demons -- petty tasks , habit , insincerity , fear -- that @entity28 battled
so , after an architecture career , a smattering of other books and countless fan letters , @entity28 , at 82 , has at least done this : he can carry on a conversation with a 9 - year - old
short of writing a classic children 's novel yourself , try this
stop trying it might 've been unlucky that @entity28 's older brother was funny , athletic , handsome , whip - smart -- the undisputed " hope of the family
" but for the younger @entity28 , it meant freedom to read encyclopedias , to absorb old @entity83 books , to lounge before @entity85 stories on the radio , to invent with the architectural samples his dad brought home , to not like anything until he found what he loved
" they gave me the greatest gift of all : they left me alone , ' " @entity28 said
" there were no expectations hanging on my head so i had a good time browsing around in my own head and inventing my own world and that was the best kind of training i could have for whatever i did
" be funny @entity28 's father was a quiet man , never one to tell a bawdy joke
but he was a great spinner of puns , a master of wordplay , a man schooled by the @entity111
" ' @entity112 , i see you 're coming early since lately , ' " he 'd say
" you used to be behind before , but now you 're first at last
' " @entity114 would freeze , confused
was this funny ? should he laugh ? " you 're a good kid , " his father would say , his hand around his son 's shoulder
" i 'd like to see you get ahead
" " after a while , he 'd pull one of these things on me , and i 'd say , ' i understand that , and i can do that , ' " @entity28 said
" and boy is that empowerment , when you suddenly realize that language is yours to play with
" do n't lie a kid has got to have mentors , @entity28 said
it 's why he gave @entity34 the kindly , talking timekeeper dog , @entity136 , and @entity137 , the lazy , grouchy , mostly harmless ne'er - do - well
@entity138 had was @entity139 -- a kindly ne'er - do - well , a humbug - ish @entity136
when young @entity3 wanted to play , @entity139 joined him
when the nephew ran away , the uncle was the one to fetch him
if you asked whether a visit to the dentist would hurt , @entity28 said , " he would tell you ' yes , ' why and for how long
that 's precious information for a kid
" estimate higher " @entity46 " could 've died in the hands of " the powers that be , " @entity28 said -- book editors and experts who said it was too clever for kids , too loaded with puns and wit
fantasy , some told him , would " disorient the children
" " luckily , " @entity28 says , the book first landed in the hands of an editor who worked outside the realm of children 's publishing
they were able to get it published with the map @entity28 designed , the layout he imagined and the words he wrote
to kids , @entity28 believed , a new word was a great discovery , one of the few things they could control
" if you think about it , there 's no such things as a difficult word , " @entity28 said
" there 's just a word you have n't come across yet
" listen and remember " children are children , and they 're still fighting the same battles , " @entity28 said
" those issues that i thought were my own personal issues , i now realize they 're the issues of every kid growing up
the basic things that control their lives -- their fears , their uncertainties , their resentments , everything like that , remain the same
" for people who write and for people who work in an area where you have to break the mold in some way , you have to retain , i guess , a good piece of the way you thought as a child
i think if you lose all of that , that 's where the deadliness comes from
the idea of children looking at things differently is a precious thing
" the most important thing you can do is notice
