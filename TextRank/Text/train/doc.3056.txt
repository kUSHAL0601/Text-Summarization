@entity0 , considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in @entity4 history , is withdrawing his name from a concussion lawsuit against the @entity4 , according to published reports
the news , first reported by the @entity9 , comes a day after media reports that the @entity12 quarterback and 14 other players had filed a lawsuit that claims the @entity4 knew for years of a link between concussions and long - term health problems and did nothing about it
@entity0 , 52 , said he did n't realize his name would be attached to the lawsuit
" within the last year i authorized a claim to be filed on my behalf just in case i needed future medical coverage to protect me and my family in the event i later suffered from the effects of head trauma , " the former @entity21 star wrote in a statement published in the @entity9 and on @entity24 's website
@entity0 said his name was " automatically " attached to the suit , which asks for a jury to decide monetary damages and seeks medical monitoring for the former players
each player submitted a brief complaint with standard language saying they suffer from brain injuries and exhibit symptoms that have developed over time
" i am sympathetic to other players who are seeking relief who may have suffered head injuries
i also disclaim any references in the form complaint of current head injuries , " he said
the @entity9 reported that @entity0 has said he only had two concussions in his 17 seasons
@entity0 was considered one of the most durable quarterbacks in the @entity4 and once started 99 games in a row
known for a quick release and not getting sacked , he still holds several @entity4 records
he was elected to the @entity12 in 2005
he did not return @entity59 's repeated calls for comment
@entity4 spokesman @entity61 said the league had no comment on the lawsuit
other former players involved in the suit are @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80
had @entity0 remained a party to the suit , he would have been one of the most high - profile former players among thousands who are suing or have sued the league through many different legal filings
after his career , @entity0 worked as an @entity4 analyst for @entity89 and @entity90
in the biggest concussion case , the @entity4 and at least 4,500 players proposed a $ 765 million settlement but a federal judge declined in january to approve the figure , saying she did n't think it was enough money
the estimated 20,000 class members over the settlement 's 65 - year lifespan would include former players with early dementia , moderate dementia , alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and / or death with a postmortem diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a brain disorder
@entity24 reported that @entity0 would be eligible for benefits from that lawsuit
