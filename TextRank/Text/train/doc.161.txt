sex between consenting homosexual partners is once again illegal in @entity2 after the country 's @entity3 overturned a lower court ruling wednesday
four years ago , @entity2 's @entity6 decriminalized such a relationship , in what was then hailed by gay rights groups as a landmark ruling
the @entity3 overturned that ruling
known as @entity13 , the law has been in the books since @entity2 's colonial - era days
it bans people from engaging in " carnal acts against the order of nature
" on wednesday , the @entity3 ruled that the penal code was constitutionally valid
it was up to parliament , the court said , to decide whether or not to keep the law in the statute books
seven year fight in 2009 , the non-profit @entity27 won a verdict from @entity30 's high court after a seven - year legal fight to decriminalize homosexuality
it argued that the law infringed on the right to equality , privacy and dignity as set out in @entity2 's @entity39
the high court ruled in @entity27 's favor
but the decision came under fire from @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity47 groups , who filed an appeal to the @entity3
@entity2 's central government did not appeal , saying it did n't disagree with the @entity6 's ruling
@entity52 @entity2 called wednesday 's @entity3 ruling " a black day of freedom in @entity2
" " it is hard not to feel let down by this judgment , which has taken @entity2 back several years in its commitment to protect basic rights , " the group said
' setback to human dignity ' until now , @entity2 has n't maintained a central database of prosecution under @entity13 , said @entity63 , a chief statistical officer at the @entity64 ( @entity64 )
" henceforth , we will be compiling crimes committed under this relevant section , " @entity63 said
" maybe from the next year
" rights activists say a number of gay couples have faced court cases because of their relationships
" there have been hundreds of trials under @entity13 in different parts of the country , " said @entity73 , a human rights lawyer
he said the law also rendered gay couples vulnerable to what he called harassment by police
the @entity84 - based group @entity83 called on the @entity2 government to take steps to scrap @entity13
" the @entity3 's ruling is a disappointing setback to human dignity , and the basic rights to privacy and non-discrimination , " the group said in a statement
" but now the government should do what it should have done in the first place and seek to repeal section 377
