@entity1 , @entity0 -- imagine every time you closed your curtains , you were capturing enough solar energy to power your laptop
the technology is available , but no one 's packaged it up in a handy @entity12 kit at your local hardware store
solar textiles use the same technology as traditional solar panels to convert sunlight into energy
@entity19 hopes to be the first
she 's not an interior designer but an architect and professor in practice at the @entity25 who is convinced that solar textiles will revolutionize the way we collect and consume power
" i 've been thinking about what happens when power and light become flexible , literally flexible , " she said
she calls it " soft power , " as in the " soft energy path , " a term coined @entity37 in the 1970s as a way to describe a world where renewable energy would gradually replace the centralized grid
later , @entity42 used the term " soft power " to describe the ability of persuasion , values and culture to influence change
@entity19 's work with soft power builds on both of these ideas
for her , soft power is the ability of flexible materials to convert sunlight into energy
" the soft power approach says there are some incredibly sensual , compelling , beautiful spaces and products that we can be producing using these emerging energy - harvesting materials , " @entity19 said
her @entity62 - based firm , @entity61 , has been working with thin - film photovoltaic material , a fabric that looks and moves like cloth but does the job of a solar panel
" these are materials which can be prepared in the chemistry lab or can be found in nature
they produce electricity when exposed to light
they are very efficient and flexible , " she said
" we are pairing the thin - film photovoltaic material with another semi-conductor material , the light - emitting diode ; they 're two sides of the same coin
one takes a little bit of the energy of sunlight and transforms it into electricity ; some takes that electricity and turns it into light
" rechargeable batteries pocketed into the hem of the curtains gather energy that can be downloaded into a larger home battery
" from a technical view , the thin - film has the potential to be produced in very high volumes , with a very low embodied energy and a low carbon footprint
these new photovoltaic materials can be produced in the same way one might print and produce a newspaper , roll to roll
that can make it very affordable , " @entity19 said
its limitations are its performance
it 's less efficient that glass - based solar technology , but @entity19 predicts that 's going to change
" right now there 's research being done on developing sensitivities in thin - film that will allow the energy to continue to be harvested , even at night
that 's going to revolutionize the applications for solar textiles , " she said
the current technology can be found hanging in the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 , in a prototype pre-fabricated home called the @entity125
farther south and west , the designers are taking their ideas from the @entity125 and applying them to a research project for a @entity130
@entity19 and her team have calculated that by covering just 10 percent of a roof area in @entity135 , @entity136 , solar curtains could provide as much as 70 percent of the average electricity used by a typical household each day
" it goes to show that you do n't need a very large area
we 've calculated that 15 square meters would be enough
" @entity19 envisions a future in which a single homeowner or a group of neighbors would decide to wean themselves off the centralized grid and power their homes using the energy they 've " harvested " themselves from the sun. " you could look at it as a type of urban farming , " @entity19 suggested , adding that one of the reasons people are n't doing it now is not the lack of technology but old habits and inherited centralized building systems in architecture
" instead of tucking way electricity and lights in walls and accessing that with a plug , we have the possibility of thinking of a whole new experience for energy , energy - harvesting and for light
" she talks about material that you could reel in from the roof and wrap around to make a new type of instant room , a @entity181
plastic wall plugs would cease to exist ; instead you 'd harness your appliance into the surface or edge of the textile
her ideas may seem radical to homeowners who do n't give much thought to where their power comes from or how much it costs , which is why @entity19 is so keen to see the solar curtains in consumer - friendly packs on hardware store shelves
" energy - harvesting solar textiles are a very good beginning point
i think that the notion of tying in a new technology with something very familiar really has its advantages if one 's about large - scale uptake and widespread adoption of a new energy regime
" regime may sound like a hard word to be used in the context of soft power , but as @entity19 says , it 's up to architects and designers to convince homeowners that there are more efficient alternatives to traditional homes
her firm is going one step further with the offer to work with developers and manufacturers who are interested in building digitally fabricated @entity125 demonstration projects
" my team is actively interested in speaking to people who are serious about realizing a pilot program that adapts the @entity125 model to actual needs on urban or rural sites
i do think the moment is now
