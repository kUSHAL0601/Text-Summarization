@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 on tuesday faced international calls to bring to justice killer mobs armed with guns and knives who massacred hundreds of villagers in the country 's rural heartland
as more details of the atrocities emerged , @entity1 's acting president , @entity11 , replaced his national security adviser , although it was not clear whether the move was related to the weekend violence
at least 200 @entity19 villagers died in the attacks early sunday , when groups of men with guns , machetes , and knives attacked people in three villages south of @entity28 , in the @entity29 , @entity17 said
other agencies gave higher death tolls
@entity32 , president of the nongovernmental agency @entity33 , put the number of dead at about 485
and a @entity19 leader who participated in a mass burial of 67 bodies monday in one of the towns said about 375 people were dead or still missing
explainer : what 's behind the violence @entity17 cited witnesses as saying the attackers were @entity46 men and that they targeted @entity47 , mostly from the @entity49 ethnic group
the victims were in the villages of @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 , about 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) south of @entity28 , the state capital
the attackers had previously lived in the villages but left last month , @entity17 said , citing multiple witness accounts
witnesses , community leaders , and journalists who visited the villages told @entity17 they saw bodies -- including those of children and babies -- inside houses , on the streets , and in the pathways leading out of the villages
they said many homes , cars , and other items were burned and destroyed
the @entity74 diplomatic mission to @entity1 expressed its " deep regret " at the violence in the area
" we extend our sympathies to those who have lost their loved ones and friends , and for the massive destruction of property , " the mission said in a statement
" we continue to urge all parties to exercise restraint and seek constructive means for addressing the continuing cycle of violence in @entity29
such loss of life and destruction can not continue to weaken the fabric of unity and peace that all @entity1 love
" the mission called on the @entity1 government to make sure the attackers are brought to justice
@entity17 called on @entity11 to make sure the attacks are " thoroughly and promptly investigated " and to prosecute those responsible
the attacks were reprisals for previous attacks against @entity46 communities in the area and the theft of cattle from herdsmen , @entity17 said
police have arrested 98 people in connection with those attacks , the group said , citing official police figures
@entity116 , the archbishop of @entity117 , told @entity118 on monday that the violence is the result of a dispute over access to natural resources , not religion
" this kind of terrible violence has left thousands dead in @entity29 in the past decade , " said @entity125 , a senior @entity126 researcher at @entity17
" the authorities need to protect these communities , bring the perpetrators to book , and address the root causes of violence
" @entity11 , who was installed as acting head of state in february while president @entity135 recovers from illness , has called for calm
he put security on high alert sunday and began operations to seek the attackers
@entity17 said the additional military presence and patrols have been largely limited , however , to major roads and towns and have not protected the smaller communities
the most populous country in @entity126 , with a population of more than 150 million , @entity1 is almost evenly divided between @entity149 and @entity47
with more than 78 million @entity149 , it has the sixth - largest @entity46 population in the world , according to a study last year by the @entity154
while some outbursts of violence are between @entity47 and @entity149 , other disputes are based on ethnicity
the country is home to 250 to 400 ethnic groups , making it one of the most diverse @entity163 nations , according to the @entity164
@entity2 's @entity165 in @entity28 , @entity1 contributed to this report .
