@entity0 -- after huffing and puffing up 354 steps to the newly reopened @entity5 crown , @entity2 figured it was time to pop the question to his girlfriend , @entity8
@entity2 proposes to @entity8 on july fourth inside the crown of the @entity5
" the @entity10 has always been a favorite holiday , so that was part of it , " @entity2 said
the couple flew to @entity0 from @entity13 , @entity14 , after managing to be among the first 240 people to snag the tickets to the @entity5 crown for its reopening after september 11 , 2001
@entity2 got down on one knee inside the narrow , 8 - foot - long deck inside the @entity5 's crown , asked @entity8 to be his wife and offered her a sizeable diamond ring
" i believe i was silent for several minutes
i was so excited , " @entity8 said
then she said " yes
" both said their families came to the @entity26 via @entity27
" my great - grandparents immigrated [ from @entity29 and @entity30 ] , " @entity2 said
his fiance 's relatives arrived from @entity30
" the thoughts behind the statue and freedom and liberty allowed our parents and great - grandparents before us to have the wonderful lives that we do , " @entity2 added
@entity8 said she was thrilled to make the long climb up a steep spiral staircase to stand inside @entity5 's crown
" it was fantastic , much smaller than we had anticipated
the view 's fantastic , " the newly engaged @entity8 said
new safety measures include double handrails , glass stairwell partitions and careful crowd control , according to interior secretary @entity48
now , only three groups of 10 visitors per hour are guided up to the crown by a @entity52
that means only about 87,000 will be able to visit each year
in the past , it took visitors at least an hour and a half to climb from the base to the crown
now , it takes only about 15 to 20 minutes
a new engineering study showed that there had to be changes to make it easier to exit the crowded staircase
crown tickets can now be reserved online up to a year in advance , but the statue will close again in two years for additional renovations .
