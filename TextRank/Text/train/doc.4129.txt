-- " down the shore , everything 's all right , " president @entity1 declared tuesday on his return to @entity4 's devastated coast seven months after @entity5 caused billions of dollars in damage there
the line from the @entity12 song " @entity14 , " popularized by local hero @entity13 , was the main theme of the joint visit by @entity1 and gov. @entity17 to survey recovery efforts and encourage people to hit the beaches this summer
@entity17 , a @entity21 , was criticized last year for appearing with @entity1 after the devastating storm at the height of the 2012 election campaign and praising the @entity27 president 's response
@entity1 subsequently won re-election while @entity17 saw his poll numbers soar
tuesday 's return visit by the pair raised anew the perception that both sought to again gain political benefit from jointly touring the disaster - stricken region
in introducing the president for remarks in drizzly @entity39 , @entity17 rejected any political machinations behind efforts to generate federal help for his state
" @entity4 is more important , our citizens ' lives are more important than any type of politics at all , " said the governor , who is up for re-election this year and is considered a potential @entity21 presidential contender in 2016
@entity1 pledged that his administration will continue to support @entity4 's recovery , reminding the crowd of his promise seven months ago that " your country would have your back
" @entity1 's cuddle bear from @entity4 ( no , not @entity17 ) " i meant it , " he said to applause
both @entity1 and @entity17 emphasized that @entity39 , made famous by @entity13 's roots there , and the rest of the @entity66 was open for business
" after all you 've dealt with , after all you 've been through , the @entity66 is back , " the president said to cheers , adding that residents " want all @entity70 to know that they are ready to welcome you here
" to drive home the point , @entity1 and @entity17 visited the @entity77 boardwalk and even engaged in a " @entity79 " football toss , with @entity1 missing his throws while @entity17 's first effort was a winner , sailing through the tire
" one and done , " the governor exclaimed , while @entity1 gave @entity17 a high - five and quipped : " that 's because he 's running for office
" a man behind the counter handed @entity1 a stuffed teddy bear with a @entity92 - themed shirt
superstorm @entity5 forced both @entity1 and @entity21 nominee @entity94 to suspend campaign activities for a few days in the final run - up to last november 's election
@entity17 , a top @entity94 surrogate who delivered the keynote address at the @entity99 , joined @entity1 for a tour of the storm damage and made a point of praising the president for his " personal concern and compassion " for the state and its people
the bipartisan display benefited both men , according to polls , and was considered a boost to @entity1 's re-election effort in the final days of the campaign
@entity17 meets @entity114 in the storm , hundreds of thousands of homes and oceanfront businesses were either damaged or destroyed
businesses on the @entity66 are still working to recover at the beginning of the busy summer tourist season , which in years past has brought billions of dollars in revenue to the state
tuesday 's trip was the second in three days by @entity1 to the site of a natural disaster following two weeks of controversies involving his administration , including the disclosure of @entity131 targeting of conservative groups and a secret subpoena for journalists ' phone records
@entity1 toured tornado - inflicted damage in @entity138 , @entity139 , on sunday and encouraged further congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities
the president praised the @entity145 for its quick response to the @entity138 tornado , just as he did last fall when @entity5 struck the @entity148
since coming under heavy criticism for missteps in the aftermath of @entity152 , @entity145 has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing bureaucratic hurdles
@entity5 relief : the need continues @entity0 's @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report .
