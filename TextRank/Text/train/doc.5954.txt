@entity0 -- @entity5 's @entity4 vice president @entity3 , who fled the country months ago , was sentenced to death sunday , an official said
the verdict came on a day when a wave of violence across @entity5 left at least 79 people dead and 270 wounded
together , the death sentence and the violence raise questions about the stability of the country just nine months after @entity17 troops were withdrawn
@entity18 was sentenced to hang " because he was involved directly in killing a female lawyer and a general with the @entity5 army , " said @entity23 , a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity24
" there are many other charges against @entity3 , but this is one of the charges he was convicted of , " @entity23 said
@entity18 denies the charges , which include the accusation that he ran death squads
he called the accusations part of a " black comedy " in february
attacks on @entity5 police , army kill dozens " everybody knows that my case is a political case , from beginning to end , and that the charges against me are fabricated and far from the truth , " @entity3 said in may
the death sentence raises the stakes in the controversy around @entity5 's top @entity49 politician , who accuses the country 's @entity51 prime minister @entity50 of pushing the country towards a religious divide
the arrest warrant for @entity3 was issued soon after his @entity57 party announced it would boycott @entity58 , saying @entity50 was cutting it out of the decision - making process
his sunni - majority party has since ended its boycott , though @entity3 remains a fugitive
one of his political allies said sunday that he did not receive a fair trial because he was not in @entity0 for it
@entity66 , a lawmaker in @entity67 , also criticized the timing of the sentence , as " @entity5 is preparing for a big national reconciliation in the near future in order to achieve stability in this country
" " this will not help , " @entity75 said
@entity5 's @entity77 sentenced @entity3 's son - in - law @entity78 to death alongside the politician
@entity78 is not in custody either
the death sentences are not final and can be appealed , @entity24 spokesman @entity23 told @entity1
@entity83 issued a " red notice " for @entity3 in may , " on suspicion of guiding and financing terrorist attacks in the country
" the notice calls on the 190 countries that belong to the international police organization to help locate and arrest him at the request of the @entity5 authorities
no apparent action has been taken to arrest him since the notice was issued four months ago
@entity18 is now living in a @entity98 government guest house in @entity99
before that , he lived in @entity5 's semi-autonomous @entity102 region and also traveled to @entity103 and @entity104 at the invitation of those governments
in february , @entity5 's top judicial committee accused @entity3 's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians from 2005 to 2011
@entity18 said the nine - judge council was under the control of the @entity51 - dominated central government and denied the charges
charges against @entity3 appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men , identified as the vice president 's security guards
@entity5 state television aired video of the confessions in december , but @entity1 has not been able to verify the men 's identities independently
among the confessions was one by a man who detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009
the person speaking said orders at times came directly from @entity3 and at times through his son - in - law , @entity78 , who is also a senior member of his staff
@entity18 did not immediately respond to the sentencing on sunday .
