a review of a computer hard drive used by cop - killing suspect @entity4 shows he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years , @entity1 state police lt. col @entity0 said friday
@entity0 said a hard drive which @entity4 had access to indicated extensive internet research on topics such as " how to avoid police manhunts , use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival
" " it did give us a lot of insight into the techniques that he might be employing -- what his escape might involve , " @entity0 said
" but it did not provide as much information as we might have hoped had it been his own computer
" @entity4 , 31 , is the suspect in a september 12 ambush that left cpl. @entity29 dead and another trooper wounded outside the @entity32 barracks in @entity33 , @entity1
he is still being sought
police were able to track @entity4 through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month , a federal law enforcement official told @entity39
@entity4 hung up after one ring , the source said
authorities asked @entity39 not to report @entity4 's cell phone use at the time
the detail can be reported now because police have identified the area where they believe @entity4 to be
the cell phone has not been turned on since that time
" i 'm not going to comment on anything that may have been done with cell phones , " @entity0 said friday
direct message from police addressing @entity4 directly , the colonel said , " you are a coward
your actions have caused tremendous disruption for an innocent community all while you try to hide from us
we will not leave ... we will protect the community
we will find you and we will bring you to justice
" the nearly two - week search for @entity4 included the abandoned @entity62 , a sprawling 46 - acre hotel complex
" @entity4 has been known to visit the area in the past and it is a large facility that needs to be cleared , " @entity1 state trooper @entity64 said via email
" there has been no sighting there or no one specific reason as to why it is being searched
" @entity0 added , " we do know he has an interest in that location and do know he has spent some time there
" a war buff obsessed with @entity81 military conflicts , @entity4 has " experimented with explosives , " @entity0 said
" we are taking that into consideration " and checking for " booby traps " while searching cabins and caves where @entity4 might have been hiding
the suspect may have a radio with him
" there is nothing in our investigation that indicates @entity4 has left the area , " he said
suspect described as very meticulous @entity4 appeared in an upcoming documentary about @entity95 re-enactors called " @entity96
" " @entity4 kind of kept himself to the side , " @entity97 , the director , told @entity39 's @entity98
" he had mannequins that he brought that he dressed in uniforms
he was very meticulous about the layout of those mannequins , the weaponry that were with them
he had magazines from the period , letters from soldiers back to their family and a lot of photography
" @entity97 said most re-enactors see what they do as a hobby
a small percentage , however , take the practice too seriously , even hoarding both antique and modern weapons
there is a sense of empowerment they feel re-enacting battles , he said
" there is the point in which the fantasy of being a soldier kind of gets blurred and they become a soldier , " he said
" and i think that 's what we are seeing here with @entity4
" @entity97 's wife , @entity135 , who also worked on the film , said of @entity4 : " he was very specific , very precise about what he did
and he actually preferred to do what they call tactical re-enactments , which are re-enactments that are private and that are performed in the woods where they actually go out and hunt the , you know , in this case , @entity144 ... he might have just snapped and took the fantasy a little bit , well , way more seriously
" on wednesday , with as many as 1,000 law enforcement officers involved in the manhunt at any given time , authorities revealed that the meticulous , grid - like search over some 3 square miles of rugged terrain was paying off
there have been a number of sightings of a man believed to be @entity4 by both residents and police , @entity0 said without giving further details
the sightings were from a significant distance , however
the search has yielded an empty pack of @entity167 cigarettes , @entity0 said
@entity4 claims to have fought with @entity167 in @entity168 and has studied @entity170 and @entity167 languages , according to the @entity171 , which last week named him one of its @entity173 fugitives
soiled adult diapers were also found , perhaps used by @entity4 to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time
authorities have said that @entity4 hated law enforcement and that they believe that he 's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians
trooper @entity182 survived the shooting
" i think this is a game to him in some ways , " @entity0 said of @entity4 this week
who is suspect @entity188 ?
