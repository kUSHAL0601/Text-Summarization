-- the @entity1 on wednesday made it somewhat easier for victims of online child porn to recover limited financial restitution from some of those who download their images
the majority in the 5 - 4 ruling concluded that lower courts could use discretion in continuing to award damages , but restitution should be based on certain criteria
awards should be tied to the " proximate " harm inflicted by the sexual predator and those who later view the resulting pictures onlline
the case involves " @entity24 , " an unwilling if ubiquitous presence in one digital cave for more than 15 years
images of her childhood rape , sexual abuse , and other criminal acts at the hands of a relative have been widely distributed in the underground world of @entity34 child pornography
" of course the victim should someday collect restitution for all her child pornography losses , " said justice @entity35
" but it makes sense to spread payment among a larger number of offenders in amounts more closely in proportion to their respective causal roles and their own circumstances so that more are made aware , through the concrete mechanism of restitution , of the impact of child - pornography possession on victims
" the case tested the interpretation and limits of a federal law designed to help those victims
at issue was the level of proof -- or causal relationship -- prosecutors must show between the defendant 's conduct and the victim 's harm
lower courts have struggled to determine what share of damages should be paid in individual cases
during january 's arguments , the justices exhibited sympathy for the woman 's pain and suffering
now 24 , she has struggled to put her life together
but many on the court had worried whether it was fair to hold a few individuals caught possessing the illegal images for full liability , when many more may be equally culpable for damages
a @entity85 man caught possessing two images of " @entity87 " -- the pseudonym given to protect her identity -- argued that he should have to pay little or nothing , for a variety of reasons , including the fact he was not directly involved in the attack on the girl or in the distribution of the images
her lawyers countered that @entity102 is liable for the full $ 3.4 million in restitution she sought for lost income , psychological and physical treatment , and other injuries suffered as " proximate result " of the crimes
the high court 's ruling will not make it easier for those like " @entity87 " to collect full damages from one or just a few violators
but the justices made clear those like @entity117 can not escape restitution by arguing their involvment in the offenses was comparatively minimal , or that determining a fair amount in the aggregate would be all but impossible
" this would serve the twin goals of helping the victim achieve eventual restitution for all her child - pornography losses and impressing upon offenders the fact that child pornography crimes , even simple possession , affect real victims , " said @entity35
a ruling favoring all of " @entity135 " legal claims could have put the burden on the defendants prosecuted first the woman 's lawyers told the court she has spent the past five years or so filing about 250 restitution requests
she has collected about $ 1.75 million in amounts from $ 100 to $ 1.2 million
@entity87 was 8 when the violent abuse was committed by her uncle , @entity144
@entity144 was prosecuted a year later and sent to prison for 10 years
he was ordered to pay $ 6,300 in mandatory restitution to his niece , the amount of counseling she required up to that time
a decade later , @entity117 was separately discovered having 300 images of child porn on his computer , including two of " @entity87
" he pleaded guilty and served two years
@entity102 was among an estimated 71,000 people worldwide who viewed the attacks
complicating matters is that distribution of those images may be a permanent part of the internet due to high - speed digital technology and greater encryption software for voyeurs of this activity
@entity102 's lawyer , @entity166 , said during arguments that since his client was the only defendant in his prosecution , the illegal acts should not be viewed in the aggregate when it came time to determining restitution
chief justice @entity175 , in dissent , said " @entity87 " deserves restitution , but the law as written is too generic to deal with the " unique " harms suffered by sexual abuse victims
" when it comes to @entity117 's crime -- possession of two of ' @entity184 -- it is not possible to do anything more than pick an arbitrary number for that ' amount
' and arbitrary is not good enough for the criminal law , " said @entity175
" the statute as written allows no recovery ( from @entity117 ) ; we ought to say so , and give @entity193 a chance to fix it
" justice @entity195 alone said the federal law allowed " @entity87 " to collect the full amount from @entity117 alone if necessary
the @entity199 administration took a middle ground in the case , with the @entity202 suggesting individual judges be given the discretion to formulate a reasonable amount of restitution
officials said about $ 18,000 by each possessor of the child porn would be appropriate in this case
" @entity87 " gave a victim impact statement in @entity102 's case where she said she lives in " constant fear " knowing those images were spread around the world , making her feel " abused over and over and over again
" the emotional pain has caused her to require weekly psychotherapy sessions
she has dropped out of college and can not stay employed
the case is @entity117 v. @entity221 ( 12 - 8561 )
internet giants pledge action to curb child pornography online @entity225 seeks to scrub web of child porn
