@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 and gen. @entity4 , the top @entity5 military commander in @entity1 , say they 've secured backing from local leaders for an upcoming military operation in the province
@entity4 took @entity3 and some of his security chiefs to @entity12 , considered the heartland of @entity15 country
with @entity4 in the front row , @entity3 delivered a full - court press to a group of about 300 tribal leaders sunday , in a bid to get their support
the group sat on carpets and cushions on the floor as they listened to @entity3 passionately talk about increasing security and ending corruption
he also had a stong message for the @entity15
" first i call on the @entity15 for peace
do not kill your country men and children
do not kill innocents , " @entity3 said
" separate yourself from @entity35 and the terrorists
" @entity4 and @entity3 believe they got approval for the coming offensive , which has already been delayed once
about a month and a half ago , another military plan presented to locals by @entity3 was rejected
@entity42 said securing support from @entity1 leaders before the start of a new offensive was critical to success
he added that this is a lesson learned from previous offensives in the country
tribal leaders had mixed reviews for the plan
some doubted @entity3 's government was capable of mounting such an offensive
others expressed faith in the president , but objected to the involvement of @entity5 troops
@entity3 did not say when the upcoming military operation would take place
but initial reports indicate that @entity1 troops will take the main role in the center of @entity12 , while @entity5 troops will be mainly on the perimeter .
