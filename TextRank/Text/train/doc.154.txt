@entity0 -- a top executive at the company that publishes the @entity6 left @entity7 this week amid allegations that the paper 's @entity10 edition used underhanded methods to boost circulation figures , the newspaper itself reported thursday
@entity15 , the executive , left on tuesday , following an internal probe which found he had pushed for two articles favorable to a company involved in the alleged circulation subterfuge , the paper said
the @entity20 , a rival newspaper , alleged that the @entity6 's publisher secretly directed funds to the company that was buying copies of the paper in bulk
in an official statement , @entity7 rejected the @entity20 's characterization of the arrangements
@entity31 " circulation programs were fully disclosed and certified , " the company said in a statement
the controversy comes on the heels of another scandal surrounding another newspaper in the @entity39 newspaper empire of @entity41 's @entity40 the @entity45 , the company 's flagship sunday @entity39 tabloid , was closed in july on the orders of @entity41 's son @entity47 , following accusations that it had illegally eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl and many others to get stories
the girl , @entity55 , later turned out to have been murdered
@entity40 owns both @entity7 , which publishes the @entity6 , and @entity56 , which published @entity45 and continues to publish the @entity57 and the @entity58
the @entity31 scandal centers on the allegation that the paper arranged for 12,000 copies a day to be sold , for one @entity10 cent each , to a company called @entity65 , the @entity6 reported
that boosted the daily circulation of the paper to 75,000 -- meaning the bulk sales to @entity65 made up more than 15 % of daily circulation
the number of copies a newspaper sells is important in determining how much advertisers are willing to pay for ads , among other factors
the @entity39 agency that audits circulation figures does not differentiate between papers that are sold at face value and those distributed in bulk -- unlike the @entity84 agency , the @entity6 said
@entity7 said its circulation reports were above board
" the practice of sponsored distribution to business schools and universities is common in the industry and clearly identified in all @entity31 publisher statements
@entity65 was paid for legitimate services rendered , " the company said
@entity15 and a @entity6 circulation department employee named @entity97 also directed thousands of euros to @entity65 in side deals , the newspaper said thursday , citing unnamed " people familiar with the matter
" @entity97 's job has since been eliminated , the paper said
@entity7 said the payments were for legitimate services rendered , but that the manner in which they were paid was " admittedly complex
" it said it canceled the deal because it was uncomfortable with it , the @entity6 reported , also noting that @entity65 denied that account and that the company was " not pleased that our name appears in this context
" @entity65 partner @entity113 said the company had invoiced for services it had actually provided , but that the invoices went to " different organizations and not to the @entity31 , " the paper reported
the firm said in a statement that @entity15 had " never promised us editorial coverage , " the @entity6 said
the internal probe found that @entity15 had advocated for two articles favorable to @entity65 , the @entity6 said
the @entity123 company describes itself as " strategy and learning architects
" an @entity65 representative told @entity1 the company would respond to a request for comment as soon as possible
the accusations against @entity7 and the @entity31 were first reported by @entity131 , a reporter for the @entity20 who has been investigating scandals at @entity40 newspapers for several years .
