@entity0 , @entity1 -- the death toll has risen to six following an attack on a @entity1 bus station that left dozens wounded , the @entity3 said sunday
at least 68 people are undergoing treatment at a @entity0 hospital , according to the agency
the explosions , which authorities believe are grenade attacks , occurred saturday at a normally - crowded bus station in central @entity0
" we still need to complete investigations and we can not immediately confirm who did this , but we highly suspect that it is @entity23 or sympathizers of @entity23 , " said @entity17 , the police deputy spokesman
" eyewitnesses say that grenades were thrown from a vehicle and the suspected perpetrators fled from the scene
" there have been several instances of grenade attacks at bus stations and at a bar in @entity0 in recent months
one person was killed and 20 injured in october when an attacker hurled grenades into a bar and a bus station
in that attack , a @entity1 man pleaded guilty to being a member of the @entity44 militant group @entity23 and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm
the @entity47 nation has been on edge since it sent its troops into @entity50 to pursue @entity23 militants after the abductions of tourists and aid workers in @entity1
it blames the abductions on @entity23 , which has denied involvement
@entity23 , which the @entity58 considers a terror group , has threatened to attack @entity1 if it does not withdraw its forces from @entity50 .
