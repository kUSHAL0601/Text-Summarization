@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 told @entity5 he wanted her from the moment he first saw her , @entity3 told a rapt jury monday at @entity4 's federal kidnapping trial
he said he planned for months how he would snatch her so she could join him and his wife in a " celestial " plural marriage , @entity3 testified
" he said they had been preparing for me since he saw me , " she said
it was the fall of 2001 , and he was panhandling outside a mall in downtown @entity0 , @entity1
@entity3 said she was with her mother and five brothers and sisters , shopping for school clothes
" my mother gave gave him five bucks , " @entity3 told told the jury
@entity4 was hired by her mother to fix a leaky skylight and rake leaves
@entity3 saw him around the house that fall but never spoke to him , she said
before dawn on june 2 , 2002 , she awoke to the sound of a man 's voice and a cold sharp blade against her throat
" i remember him saying , ' i have a knife to your neck
do n't make a sound
get out of bed and come with me or i will kill you and your family , ' " @entity3 testified
he led her in her red silk pajamas up a trail into the rugged back country and over a ridge , hiking what she estimated to be three to five hours to a crude campsite
there , she said , he " sealed " her to him as his wife and raped her
she said she begged him to stop , pleading , " i 'm just a little girl
" she struggled , but she said at age 14 she was was no match for a grown man
afterwards , she cried herself to sleep
the next day , as she cried again , he told her she was " lucky , " @entity3 testified
he said he was a prophet and that @entity57 had chosen her to be by his side as he prepared for the second coming of @entity60
she said she did n't feel lucky at all
" i felt like i had a burden the size of a mountain to carry around with me the rest of my life , " @entity3 said
now 23 and living in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity3 spent much of the day on the witness stand monday , beginning a detailed description of her nine months of captivity with @entity4 and his wife , @entity73
she spoke of being raped " daily at the very least , " tethered between two trees " like an animal , " and forced to watch and participate in sex acts she found repugnant
she said she was forced to smoke cigarettes and drink wine and " hard liquor
" she did not have to face her alleged abductor on monday
@entity4 , 57 , loudly sings hymns whenever he is in court
he had been ejected , as usual , from the courtroom and was watching the trial from another room
he is charged with kidnapping and taking a minor across state lines for sex
if convicted , he faces life in prison
@entity4 's attorneys do not dispute what happened but say their client was insane at the time of the alleged abduction , and therefore not reponsible for his actions
" you 'll have to ferret out not only what happened , but why it happened , " attorney @entity101 told jurors earlier monday
" we 're asking you to determine what was in someone 's mind
this is made difficult with a crazy mind
the easy explanation is not always the correct one
" he described his client as " a crazy person who comes in the middle of the night " -- exactly what we are taught to fear as children , he said
@entity3 told the jury she thought about running away that first morning , despite the threats against her life and her family
" i did n't want to spend another day with him
i never wanted to see him again , " she said
" i 'd seen what he had done to me
i 'd seen how he had come in and taken me from my the bed , the place i thought was the safest place in the world , in my home , with my sister beside me
" she continued , " i felt that because of what he had done to me , i was marked
i was n't the same
my personal value had dropped
another person could never love me and and i felt , yeah , i could take the risk of trying to escape and being killed
" later , after the shock began to wear off , she said she thought about her parents and the life she had before
" i decided my parents would always love me despite what he did to me , " she told the jury
" i had n't changed
i was still a person of worth ... i decided to live
" after that , she began to go along with what @entity4 told her to do
she listened , and even began to mimic his speech and his ways
as she stepped off the witness stand , @entity3 walked over to her parents , @entity158 and @entity159 , who embraced her
she returns to the witness stand on tuesday
earlier monday , @entity3 testified about the night of her abduction
" i thought i was having a nightmare , " she said of being led away by a bearded man in dark clothing and a stocking cap
" it was indescribable fear
" @entity3 's younger sister @entity168 , who witnessed the abduction , testified about awakening her parents with the words : " @entity5 is gone
" also testifying monday was the @entity173 ' mother , @entity159
she spent less than an hour on the witness stand , recalling how the family hired @entity4 -- who then called himself @entity176 -- to do odd jobs
but most of her testimony focused on hearing the news that her daughter had been taken
" ( @entity168 ) said that a man had taken @entity5 with a gun and we would n't find her , " @entity183 testified
" he took her either for ransom or for a hostage
" as her husband , @entity158 , searched the house , @entity183 said , she ran downstairs , turned on the lights , and saw that the kitchen window was open , its screen cut
she testified she had opened the window the previous evening when she burned some potatoes while making dinner
" my heart sank and i called out to @entity158 , ' call 9 - 1 - 1 , ' " she testified
" it was utter terror
it was the worst feeling , knowing that i did n't know where my child was
" as her family frantically searched the house , @entity5 testified , she was being led at knifepoint on the strenuous hours - long hike to a hillside encampment
" i remember asking him if he realized what he was doing , and he said he did , " she said
" and i remember saying that if he let me go right now , we would n't press charges on him
and he said he knew exactly what he was doing and he understood the consequences of his actions
" suddenly , she recognized his face , she testified , and the name @entity176 came to her
she said she asked why he would do this
" my parents had only tried to help him , " she said
" he told me he was going to hold me for ransom , and i told him my parents would pay any amount to have me back
" @entity3 was found nine months after her abduction , walking on a street in the suburb of @entity227 , @entity1 , in the company of @entity4 and @entity73
@entity73 , 64 , pleaded guilty in november 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in may to 15 years in federal prison
she also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap @entity3 's cousin a month after @entity3 was kidnapped
she was given a sentence of one to 15 years , to be served concurrently with the federal sentence , and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody
as part of her plea agreement , @entity73 agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband
in @entity249 's @entity248 and @entity250 contributed to this report .
