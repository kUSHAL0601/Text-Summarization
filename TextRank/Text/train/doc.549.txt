@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 upstart @entity2 claimed victory tuesday with a familiar tea party rallying cry
" @entity9 and @entity10 are rising up to reclaim our country , to defend liberty and to restore the @entity14 , " he told supporters
@entity2 claims victory in @entity4 runoff a 41 - year - old , first - time candidate , @entity2 walloped the well - funded @entity3 establishment candidate , @entity4 lt. gov. @entity19 , in tuesday 's @entity21 primary runoff
he did so by vowing to stand by his tea party principles
" politicians cut deals ; principled conservatives deliver , " is the way a @entity2 television ad summed up his message
@entity30 @entity21 leaders reacted to @entity2 's primary win with a warning : if he wins the general election in november , gridlock in the @entity21 will be even worse than it is now
" anyone elected to the @entity21 who starts off by saying ' i wo n't compromise ' is n't going to help us , " senate majority whip @entity36 told @entity1
the tea party movement is a good foil for @entity30 , but the reality is @entity2 's vote probably would n't make that much difference , because he 's replacing @entity3 @entity46 , and she votes with the @entity3 90 percent of the time
still , democrats do have a point that @entity2 , like any senator , would have a lot of power to grind business to a halt
" you know what the @entity21 is like , " said @entity36
" one senator stands up and says no , we stop the train , until we figure out how to bring that senator around
" and @entity2 would n't be the only possible new senator willing to do that
in @entity64 , @entity63 beat veteran @entity3 incumbent sen. @entity65 , vowing confrontation over compromise
@entity65 's loss further polarizes @entity21 " what i 've said is , and what i continue to believe , certainly , is one side or the other must prevail
and i 'm hoping this candidacy will help move the @entity3 forward to become a permanent majority , " @entity63 said the day before his @entity3 primary win in may
the @entity21 was already bound to be a more polarized place next year because so many moderates chose to leave
nearly half a dozen from both parties are retiring this year , including sen. @entity81 , @entity82 ; sen. @entity83 , @entity84 ; sen. @entity85 , @entity86 ; sen. @entity87 , @entity88 and sen. @entity89 , @entity90
@entity81 retirement a blow to @entity21 's ' sensible center ' still , it 's an open question whether tea party rhetoric on the campaign trail translates into action in office
@entity100 was a @entity21 @entity100 leadership aide for years , and he said history shows leaders can never be sure what rank and file firebrands like @entity2 will do
" @entity2 is going to be a new voice , and he 's going to be a variable that we do n't know what to expect ( from ) yet , " said @entity100
" he can hold everything up if he wants to or he can go against the @entity21 @entity3 leadership
" two years ago , a handful of successful tea party - backed @entity21 candidates promised to hold their own leadership 's feet to the fire to slash spending , shrink the government and protect civil liberties
sen. @entity121 , @entity122 ; sen. @entity123 , @entity124 ; sen. @entity125 , @entity126 ; and others beat party favorites by vowing to shake up the @entity3 establishment once in @entity0
but once they became senators , uncompromising demands were rare
last year , @entity125 sounded off against his @entity3 leadership and held up @entity21 passage of a bill extending parts of the @entity137
but , by and large , the so - called @entity114 threat of halting business to make a point did n't often bear itself out
" if you look at conservatives across the board , in the past year or so , there has n't been a whole sea change that we thought would happen , " said @entity100
sen. @entity147 , @entity82 - @entity148 , is a sort of tea party kingmaker
much to the chagrin of his party leadership , in 2010 he helped defeat @entity3 candidates across the country that @entity3 leaders supported
that streak continues this year with @entity2
@entity147 told @entity1 the political action committee he started and still advises gave @entity2 $ 2 million in addition to critical help with the conservative grassroots
@entity147 argues the more tea party movement - backed senators , the less gridlock
" ( when ) @entity2 comes in ... i think he can help empower some of the @entity30 to make those hard decisions , " @entity147 told @entity1
the @entity148 lawmaker believes the more staunch conservatives in the @entity21 , the more @entity30 will be forced to compromise and come the @entity3 's way
" i think there are enough @entity30 , if we have a strong mandate election , who will work with people like @entity2 and ( @entity147 ) @entity174 and ( sen. ) @entity175 and these senators here , in a sensible way to change the course of our country , " said @entity147
" the good news is this : because the rest of the world is in such bad shape , if we make a few hard decisions about fixing our tax code , fixing our entitlements so that we 're on a sustainable course , @entity10 could be the best place to do business overnight
" one thing is clear : if the @entity3 succeeds in winning back control of the @entity21 , expectations will be a lot higher and pressure on the @entity3 leadership will be a lot more intense not to give in on the " stick - to - our principles " sensibilities driving voters towards tea party - backed candidates like @entity2
sen. @entity203 , @entity204 , is the man in charge of electing enough republicans to the @entity21 to take the majority
in a @entity210 hallway conversation , even he nodded and smiled in agreement with the notion that it 's a lot easier to coordinate and control the caucus when you 're in the majority
it 's a problem he and sen. @entity217 , the current @entity21 minority leader , relish having .
