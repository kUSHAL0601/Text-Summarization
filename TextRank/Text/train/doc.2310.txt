it is noon , and the light filters softly through the water
@entity4 , camera in tow , drifts to the sea floor to capture an intimate portrait of a @entity10 man
in the dreamlike photograph , the @entity10 extends his hand upward as though he were dancing
" all these movements they do with their hands , " @entity4 said
" they 're trying to keep themselves down ( on the seafloor ) , move forward or stay in place
" the @entity10 are a tribe of nomadic sea dwellers who have lived off the shore of northeast @entity24 for more than 200 years
they are a stateless people with no nationality in the traditional sense , residing instead in boats and living off the sea
as highly skilled divers , the @entity10 are able to walk along the seafloor hunting for fish and pearls
@entity4 sought to photograph the @entity10 as part of a larger project about stateless people that has taken him to places such as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity43 territories
" the project is a question , " @entity4 said
" why do we need to have flags and borders ? " @entity4 said that in recent years , increasing amounts of @entity10 are transitioning to a life on land
their background as a stateless people , however , awards them no recognition by the @entity59 government or access to things such as health care or education
" they do n't speak @entity65 or even know how old they are , " @entity4 said
despite the pull toward a more modern way of living , there are still @entity10 who choose life at sea
but even sea dwellers feel the effects of modernization
" they do n't dive so much anymore , " @entity4 said
" they use more modern methods ( of fishing )
they sell fish to different companies and tourists , even to land @entity84
" @entity4 wanted his photographs to reflect the essence of their statelessness , to create a sort of " imaginary stateless nation
" the images are ethereal and emotional underwater portraits of the @entity10 in their natural environment
social media follow @ @entity95 on @entity96 to join the conversation about photography
" i wanted to show who they are , " he said
" i did n't want to create some sort of anthropology catalog
i wanted to go beyond who 's who
these underwater portraits were perfect for that
" this project was the first time @entity4 photographed underwater
" i had never even dived before , " he said
underwater photography requires special equipment , like housing for the camera , and the weather conditions must be perfect
" the sea must be calm and the water must be clean , " he said
" you need the sun to be as high as possible
" although the type of diving @entity4 did with the @entity10 can be dangerous , he did it without an oxygen tank
he experienced rain and a hailstorm his first two days of shooting
around the third day , @entity4 began to gain the trust of the @entity10 and they , in turn , began to understand the type of image @entity4 wanted
" they 're posing in all of the pictures , " @entity4 said
" i told them , ' i want to show what you normally do
' after we got the first picture , they understood what we wanted
" the soft light and the way the @entity10 pose in the water reflect the " imaginary stateless nation " @entity4 wanted to convey , causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity
" it 's abstract , " @entity4 said
" the concept of nations has always been malleable
" @entity4 is a @entity150 photographer
he is one of the founders of me - @entity153 .
