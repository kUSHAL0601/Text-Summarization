-- a @entity2 , @entity3 , man is due in court thursday to face charges that he raped a 13 - year - old runaway police say he held prisoner in his home for six months
@entity9 , 26 , has pleaded not guilty to second - degree rape , unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference
thursday 's hearing will determine if the case should be referred to a grand jury
@entity2 police said that @entity9 kept the girl in his home from july through december 2009 , behind dead - bolt locks and doors with no doorknobs
a criminal complaint alleges that @entity9 had sex with her more than 100 times
@entity26 spokesman @entity25 said @entity9 also forced the girl to baby - sit his year - old son
@entity9 is unmarried , and the identity of the child 's mother is not known
police would not say how the girl left @entity35 's home , why there was a delay from december to february for his arrest or where the teenager is now
@entity9 was arrested friday when police raided his home on a child - abuse allegation , @entity2 media reported
the next day , @entity44 judge @entity43 set bond at $ 250,000 in an arraignment at which @entity9 represented himself
he has since been provided with a court - appointed attorney , according to media reports
but friends of the defendant told the @entity52 that he was nothing more than a @entity54 trying to help a runaway girl he met in a @entity2 park
" everybody has had their moments , but @entity60 is not a monster
as long as i 've known @entity60 , he 's always been kindhearted to me
if he could help you , he will help you , " @entity63 , 20 , who grew up next door to @entity9 's relatives , told the paper
" @entity60 always had her calling to someone , supposedly her aunt , to say she was doing ok
from what i knew , her aunt or her mom knew where she was staying , " said @entity63 , who previously had a romantic relationship with @entity9
" to look at her , she is very developed physically , and you would think that she is older than 13
" @entity63 said the girl told her she was 17 or 18 and denied having sex with @entity9 , and that she also said she did not want to go home to her mother , the @entity52 said
police told the news that the family filed several missing person reports after the girl disappeared in july
and an unnamed law enforcement official told the paper that @entity9 was a manipulative drug dealer who " lured her in " and kept her trapped physically and psychologically
@entity0 , however , could not confirm that official 's view
@entity92 , who lives four doors from @entity9 , said he was surprised when he learned about the accusations
" this is a street where everyone knows everyone , " said @entity92 , who remembered @entity9 moving in about a year - and - a - half ago
" i never recall him with a 13 - year - old girl
" @entity92 said @entity9 was seldom home , and their brief conversations were limited to @entity9 's two dogs
other neighbors told @entity92 the house had a steady stream of visitors on any given day .
