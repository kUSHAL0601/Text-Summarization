@entity0 -- olympic star @entity2 said friday that he tries to maintain a sense of humor and perspective despite his intense focus on swimming -- one that leaves him little time for romantic relationships or much else besides training and competing
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity13 , @entity2 showed off one of his grills , which he said shows " part of my personality
" just one of the jewel - encrusted items that often adorn his teeth is reportedly worth $ 25,000
" i am taking this seriously , but there 's so much more to life than just swimming , " he said
" that 's what i want to have people know : you know what , i 'm having fun doing this
" still , free time for the 28 - year - old -- who has been called one of the @entity36 ' most eligible bachelors -- has been severely limited over the past decade
when asked " who gets more women , " he or rival and fellow @entity40 swimmer @entity39 , @entity2 said he does by a " 60/40 " margin
still , the swimmer -- whose mother , @entity46 , created a media hubbub recently when she said her son only had time for " one - night stands , " which he explained had to do with sporadic dates and not sexual flings -- said it is hard for him to cultivate a long - term relationship given his training regimen
@entity56 leads @entity40 gold rush in pool " i am young , but that 's not me , " @entity2 said of one - night stands
" i like being in relationships
when i am in a relationship , i want to give ( a woman ) my entire heart , " he added
" and lately i have n't been able to do that just because swimming has taken such a big role in my life
" if he could choose anyone to whisk away to a deserted island , the @entity69 , @entity70 , native did n't hesitate as to who he 'd pick : " @entity76 " actress @entity74
" she is gorgeous , " he said of @entity74 , who is currently dating actor @entity77
as to what he 'd say to her if they met , @entity2 jokingly said , " i would be like , ' hi ... you want to go to an island with me ? ' " @entity2 entered the @entity83 as one of his nation 's most highly touted athletes , having won two golds and two bronze medals four years earlier in @entity89 and threatening to topple @entity56 from his perch atop the swimming world this year
@entity0 2012 : live blog immediately , he made a splash by defeating @entity56 and others for the 400 - meter individual medley gold on the day after the opening ceremony
his luster was tarnished slightly the next day when @entity100 's @entity99 chased him down on the final leg of the 4x200 - meter freestyle relay to win that race
that silver was better , though , than his result monday when he finished fourth in the 200 - meter freestyle individual race
@entity2 rebounded with two medals on thursday -- bronze in the 200 - meter backstroke and a silver in the 200 - meter individual medley , this time finishing right behind @entity56
the next day , the swimmer acknowledged to @entity1 that he 's had " ups and downs " during the @entity83 but overall , he 's satisfied with his performance
" i 'm happy , " he said
" i 'm coming back to my country with five @entity36 medals
and that 's amazing right there
" bold move put @entity122 on path to gold getting to this point has n't been easy
@entity2 pointed to his exhaustive focus on swimming over the past eight years , involving " a lot , a lot of early morning practices ... going into a freezing cold pool
" but he said that it 's all been worth it to put on a swim cap adorned with an @entity40 flag , and especially when his national anthem is played after a gold medal performance " it 's everything -- chills , excitement , knowing that i 'm not just swimming for myself , i 'm swimming for my whole entire country
it 's one of the greatest feelings in the world , " @entity2 said
" there 's nothing like it
it 's something that you will cherish for the rest of your life
