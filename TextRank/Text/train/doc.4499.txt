-- @entity8 goes on trial friday in @entity3 , ready to admit to killing a 21 - year - old woman while planning to fight more stringent charges that could land him more time in prison , his lawyer said
about six and a half years ago , the @entity11 national was considered the prime suspect in the case of @entity16 teenager @entity14 , who vanished while on a graduation trip to the @entity20 island of @entity21
he was arrested twice but never charged in connection with @entity24 's disappearance , which is still unsolved
yet van @entity8 's trial in another high - profile case , which his lawyer said has a tenuous connection with the @entity24 story , is set to go forward friday
the 24 - year - old is accused of killing @entity32 in his @entity34 hotel room in may 2010
police say that he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to @entity41 , where he was arrested a few days later
@entity8 was charged last september with " qualified murder " and simple robbery , which together could carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison
@entity48 ' family later tried -- unsuccessfully -- to convince three judges from the superior court of @entity34 to impose an even more serious slate of charges that could have included a life sentence
his attorney , @entity54 , told @entity55 on wednesday that his client " will accept at trial the charge of simple homicide
... what he will not accept are the aggravated charges
" " we are sure that -- with support from ... experts -- it will be determined that @entity8 was living in a post-traumatic state during the attack , " @entity54 said , adding that " psychologists and psychiatrists " will testify at van der @entity8 's upcoming trial
he pointed to the @entity24 case , noting that the fatal attack on @entity32 occurred exactly five years after the @entity16 girl went missing
it has been widely reported that van der @entity8 killed the woman after he believed she saw something on the @entity77 relating to @entity24
" he is a young man ... who has practically lived persecuted for a crime he says he did not commit ... or for a disappearance that he can not explain , " the lawyer said of van der @entity8
" movies and books have been made ... at that age , and with other characteristics of his psychological profile , ... in that moment , he felt threatened and reacted in a brutal manner
" @entity87 said that he and his client will ask the judges for a 7 - to 20 - year sentence , " which are the legal sentencing parameters for homicide
" he contended his client never planned to " entrap ... the future victim in a casino where there are more than 30 cameras " while he was staying in a room registered under his legal name , and then kill her
" there was no premeditation , " the lawyer argued
the victim 's family , including her father @entity104 , had pushed for stiffer charges and claimed that van der @entity8 has n't looked " remorseful " in court appearances
" he had an indifferent and prideful attitude
he looks as if he has everything under control
he looks better than when he appeared on tv after he was arrested , " @entity104 told @entity0 last year
three judges will preside over @entity8 's trial , starting friday , and there is no jury
the proceedings will begin with the prosecutor stating the " facts " that have been proven in the case , as well as detailing the alleged crimes committed , according to @entity3 lawyer and @entity122 professor @entity121
then the lead judge will talk generally about the crime , after which van der @entity8 's side will have the floor
this round of the case could include testimony from the accused , though @entity54 said that van der @entity131 likely would n't give a statement friday though he may answer questions from judges
the other scheduled trial dates are next tuesday and thursday , though the judges could adjust the plans at any time
besides the @entity32 ' murder trial , van der @entity8 also faces extradition charges to the @entity140
in june 2010 , a federal grand jury in @entity16 indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from @entity24 's mother
he was given a total of $ 25,000 , and authorities believe he used that money to travel to @entity3 and participate in a poker tournament , where he met @entity32
@entity55 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .
