-- the dead ca n't speak
and , for police , firefighters and paramedics , the incessant chirping , bleating and incongruously cheerful boom box beats of victims ' cell phones comprise a soundtrack of disaster
it happened at the @entity15 shootings in 2007 , a commuter train crash in @entity17 the next year , the movie theater massacre in @entity19 , @entity20 , last july and , again , at the night club fire in @entity22 that killed 231 people on sunday
the incessantly ringing phones , and the realization that someone is desperately trying to reach someone else who is now dead , short - circuits the psychological defenses first responders need to do their jobs , said @entity32 , a registered nurse who helps train them for the @entity34
four arrested in connection with deadly @entity22 nightclub fire " it starts ringing and it becomes an instant reminder that this person is human , that they have friends and family who care , " he said
it also leaves responders with an uneasy feeling they 're keeping a secret from the victim 's loved ones , @entity32 said
@entity32 first ran across the issue following the @entity15 shooting , in which a lone gunman , a student , killed 32 people
some first responders could n't get the sound of ringing cell phones out of their ears , psychologists @entity57 of @entity15 and @entity58 of @entity59 wrote in a follow up journal article
" as police and rescue workers removed the bodies of the deceased and evacuated the survivors , they reported haunting memories of cell phones ringing in body bags as parents and friends desperately called their loved ones
" @entity17 first responders dealt with the same issue when a commuter train collided with a freight train in 2008
be ready for emergency at a crowded public gathering hundreds of firefighters and other first responders flooded the scene , clawing through the mangled wreckage to get at the bodies of victims
all the while , @entity32 said , dozens of cell phones kept ringing
@entity19 police officer @entity87 spoke this month during a court hearing of entering a theater where 12 people died in that shooting rampage
the things he noticed : blood running down the steps and the sound of cell phones ringing
it was the same sunday night , when firefighters rushed through a hole punched into the wall of the @entity102 nightclub by people who had escaped the building after it caught on fire
they found dozens of bodies of club - goers who died of smoke inhalation
and they once again heard the sounds of ringing phones
@entity113 , a reporter from @entity114 , said some 800 to 900 mobile phones were going off at the same time
one alone had 104 missed calls
hundreds of family and friends were desperately trying to reach loved ones who were at the nightclub in the @entity22 city of @entity122 when a fire swept through early sunday , killing at least 230 people and injuring hundreds more
@entity22 nightclub fire : ' like a war zone ' with bodies piled " it was a really complicated scene
a lot of smoke , a lot of shoes that were left , cell phones , because everybody tried to get out of there running , " @entity129 , a reporter for @entity0 affiliate @entity130 said
" while we were there , we saw the cell phones were ringing
it was parents , friends , trying to know about what was happening and nobody was answering
" few , if any , agencies have policies on what to do about the multitude of ringing phones police and firefighters frequently encounter at disaster scenes , @entity32 said
he said he tells trainees turning off the phones can help save their own sanity , but says some agencies could view the act as tampering with evidence
he favors policies that would allow responders to turn the phones off , but says most commanders have n't yet come to the same conclusion
" it 's a 21st century problem , " he said
but it 's an issue emergency agencies will have to deal with sooner or later , if the experience of first responders @entity32 has spoken to is any indication
" they do n't talk about it openly , but when you get them alone ... " @entity32 said , like the responders , leaving the rest unspoken
