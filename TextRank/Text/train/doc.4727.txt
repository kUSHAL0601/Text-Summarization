-- fewer crowds and pleasant weather make autumn a great time to explore @entity3 , but for many @entity5 the destination has suddenly become fraught with worry and potential danger
a day after the @entity5 issued a general travel alert for @entity5 in @entity3 amid concerns that @entity10 is planning attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in @entity13 , @entity14 , many travelers may be trying to figure out what to do next
still , the alert should scare no one from going to @entity3 , said current and former @entity19 officials -- a sentiment echoed by some travel experts
" i do n't think anyone should cancel a trip
the chances of something happening to a particular individual are very , very slim , " said @entity25 , president of @entity26 , who just returned from @entity27 , @entity28 , on sunday
travel alert issued for @entity5 citizens in @entity3 travel agents said they 've seen limited impact from the alert so far
two people with trips booked to @entity27 and @entity39 , @entity40 , have called @entity41 in @entity42 asking what they should do , said @entity44 , senior vice president of leisure sales at the travel agency
he was able to offer the worried clients few answers beyond letting them know how much money they might lose if they decide to cancel
" that 's all we really can say since it 's a rather nebulous warning , " @entity44 said
" i expect more calls
nobody has canceled yet ; they 're just questioning , seeing what their options are
" there may be few new bookings this week because of the alert , but most travelers with plans already in place likely will not cancel them , said @entity64 , a travel agent who specializes in @entity40 and works for @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67
not only do most affluent travelers like to go in september and the first half of october because schools are back in session , but it is a particularly busy time in @entity39 because of fashion week , she added
" i 've had one client say , ' @entity75 it 's a little intense right now , ' but i 've certainly have not seen any effect on bookings , " @entity64 said
not intimidated @entity5 tourists already in @entity3 are on alert , but many continue to flock to popular landmarks , refusing to be intimidated by the threat
@entity84 , who arrived in @entity27 last week from @entity85 to celebrate her birthday , went to see the changing of the guard at @entity89 and said the place was packed
she 's also not changing her travel plans
" the only thing we 've changed is we 've elected not to go downstairs [ at the hotel ] in the evening to have a drink in the very large lobby bar , " @entity84 said
" i do n't believe in allowing terrorists to do what they do , which is to terrorize me
if we act terrorized , then they win
" because the alert is so vague , travel agents said people should take the same kinds of precautions they always would when traveling : be cautious , stay alert and look for anything suspicious
how to protect yourself abroad watch out when you go to a large gathering , added @entity109 , a travel agent who specializes in @entity110 and works for @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113
most of her clients avoid the big cities and go to southern @entity110 , where she believes there is little or no threat
travelers should also look beyond their activities and sightseeing
" just be aware of your surroundings , keep an ear on the international news -- people do n't always do that when they 're traveling , " @entity64 said
meanwhile , travel agents are watching and waiting to see what kind of a long - term impact the alert will have
" certainly , we 're always worried when something like this happens because it always affects travel
there are always going to be people who are going to say , ' i 'm going to put it off , ' " @entity44 said .
