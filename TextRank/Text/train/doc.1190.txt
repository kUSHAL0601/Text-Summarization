@entity16 , @entity17 : hi , i 'm @entity19
you 've landed on @entity0
first up : job creation @entity21 : during a speech yesterday , president @entity22 offered some ideas on how to create new jobs and help out the country 's economy : offering tax breaks to small businesses , expanding some of the government 's stimulus programs , and spending more funds on infrastructure projects -- things like roads , bridges and water systems
the thing is , all of that costs money
and that 's where the @entity43 comes in
that 's the @entity43 , the financial industry bailout passed last year
the bailout ended up not costing as much as expected , and president @entity22 thinks the extra could be used to help out in other ways
@entity49 president @entity22 : the @entity43 program was flawed and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly
and today , @entity43 has served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected
in fact , because of our stewardship of this program and the transparency and accountability that we put in place , @entity43 is expected to cost taxpayers at least $ 200 billion less than it was anticipated just this past summer
@entity21 : couple of things to keep in mind here , though
first , @entity67 officials say that they ca n't just use @entity43 money to pay for infrastructure projects ; the program just does n't work like that
and second , some republicans are outraged by the idea of spending any unused @entity43 funds because they say that money was supposed to help pay off the country 's debt
@entity78 @entity77 , ( r ) minority leader : this makes me so angry
i know all about @entity43
first , it was never intended that all this money would ever have to be spent
but any money that was n't spent was to go to the deficit
and the idea of taking this money and spending it is repulsive
health care debate @entity21 : senators are considering alternatives to part of their health care legislation
specifically , the so - called public option : that 's a government - run health insurance program
@entity96 , and some @entity97 and @entity98 , are against that plan
a group of @entity97 senators was working to come up with some other ideas that could replace the public option
late last night , they said they had reached an agreement
if the @entity108 passes its health care bill , that does n't make it law
it would still need to be combined with the @entity67 bill , and then that final version would need to pass both the @entity67 and the @entity108
@entity114 @entity21 : the head of @entity5 's government says that a series of suicide bombings is designed to create chaos in that country and prevent progress toward elections that are scheduled for next year
prime minister @entity123 called yesterday 's terrorist attacks " cowardly
" the five explosions killed more than 125 people and injured more than 440 others
the bombings all took place within minutes of each other tuesday morning
they targeted several government buildings around the capital city of @entity4 , as well as a neighborhood and a business district
is this legit ? @entity136 , @entity17 : is this legit ? @entity137 is the @entity49 secretary of defense
not legit ! @entity138 is the defense secretary
he was appointed by president @entity139 , and president @entity22 asked him to stay on the job
defense secretary visit @entity21 : it 's mr. @entity138 ' job to advise the president on military issues like the war in @entity7
and that is where the defense secretary is right now , meeting with military officials and @entity7 leaders following president @entity22 's announcement that he plans to send 30,000 additional @entity49 forces to @entity7
@entity153 has more on mr. @entity138 ' trip there and some of the challenges that @entity49 troops face there
( begin video ) @entity159 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : defense secretary @entity160 arrived in @entity7 on an unannounced trip
he is here , of course , for the first time since president @entity22 made the announcement that 30,000 additional @entity49 troops will be headed to this war zone
the defense secretary plans to meet with troops , commanders , and he has already met with @entity7 president @entity169 to talk about the way ahead , @entity138 assuring @entity169 that the @entity49 has a continuing commitment to this country
but where we are right now , at @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , south of @entity6 , really illustrates the continuing security challenge in this country
the @entity181 task force that operates here has already had the plus - up from 300 troops to 3,000 troops operating in this region to try and get a handle on security against the @entity189 and the insurgents
one of their major jobs here is to continue every day to secure @entity194 , the main road to @entity6
the road is secure right now , they tell us , because the troops , @entity49 and @entity7 troops , are out patrolling every day
if the troops were n't out there , the feeling is that the @entity189 and the insurgents would again rear their head and control the road and really hinder commerce and development in this region
so , that 's the bottom line here
it 's a continuing , spotty security picture
where the troops are , security improves
but where the troops are not located , security still very troublesome in many areas of this country
( @entity215 ) promo @entity21 : another member of president @entity22 's @entity218 , education secretary @entity219 , can have an impact on your education
@entity223 , @entity224 @entity67 correspondent , is going to interview @entity225 , and mr. @entity223 wants to know what you would ask @entity219 if you had the chance
so , teachers and students , share your questions on our blog
we 'll share them with @entity223 , and you might hear your question answered on our show
@entity236 @entity237 , @entity17 : time for the shoutout ! when does winter officially start ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) october 31 , @entity244 ) november 15 , c ) december 21 or @entity245 ) january 1 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! winter begins around december 21 , which is the winter solstice , the shortest day of the year
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity251 @entity21 : do n't tell that to the folks who are already getting hammered by the first major storm of the season
states out west got slammed by two to three feet of snow , winds whipping around at up to 90 miles per hour
even some desert states felt the freeze
check out this video from @entity261 ! the storm is making its way east , and as of yesterday , parts of @entity265 and @entity266 were both under a blizzard warning
@entity269 @entity21 : some homes are protected against winter cold by weatherizing , which keeps heat in and costs down
installing it is an example of a green - collar job , work that 's focused on the environment
@entity279 shows us how some folks are learning to be part of a green - collar world
( begin video ) @entity285 : hot air is coming into your house
you know that you 're losing , what ? @entity290 : energy
@entity291 , @entity0 business correspondent : the skills taught here are green
@entity285 : this is recycled newspaper
@entity295 : and so are the students
@entity297 , program director , @entity299 : we do work with 17 - to 24 - year - olds who lack work history , are often low income , court involved
our corps members do n't want to hang out on the street
they want to be productive
@entity295 : that 's where @entity309 comes in
based in @entity8 and funded through a grant from the @entity49 @entity313 , the program teaches young adults how to weatherize and rehabilitate homes
@entity316 : we 're giving a general base of construction knowledge , carpentry skills
we also emphasize academic improvement , work readiness , and really encourage our corps members to make positive life decisions
@entity285 : there 's a lot of work to be done in @entity8
@entity295 : one of the people doing that work is @entity330 graduate @entity329
after completing the program , he landed a job with local contractor @entity333 , weatherizing homes and building new ones
@entity336 , @entity337 : i believe that this program helps kids by , you know , letting them see that there is another way , you know , besides , you know , maybe they are n't , you know , high ... maybe they do n't have their high school diploma , or maybe they are n't the ones who go to college
so this program , you know , it invites them in and it gives them the opportunity to learn a trade , you know , to learn a skill
on average , their energy bill will be $ 20 - $ 30 on a month
@entity295 : despite @entity329 's success , jobs are still hard to come by
so far , out of 177 @entity330 graduates , 37 percent have found jobs and a third have gone back to school
even those who did n't immediately find work have achieved something
@entity370 , brotherhood way : for @entity329 and so many other young adults , when they finish the program , they are ready to be thrown into the work force
@entity295 : so , when the job market does turn around , they 're ready
@entity279 , @entity0 , @entity378
( @entity215 ) before we go @entity21 : before we go , we have some really cool pictures for you today , but as neat as they look , it does n't seem like a good idea
up to 20 - foot waves -- swells so powerful that people staying in a hotel near the shore could feel them crash -- they thundered in to the @entity392 island of @entity393 on tuesday
they kept tourists from sleeping , ate up tons of beach , and despite the power and the danger , yep , surf 's up ! hope these guys know what they 're doing
goodbye @entity21 : because for amateurs like me , it would 've been a total washout
@entity0 is rolling in again tomorrow , keeping you current on more headlines
we 'll see you then .
