-- attention travelers : your high - flying status with @entity4 may take a dive with the airline 's new frequent flier rules
@entity4 announced a new spending requirement thursday for gaining elite status in the airline 's @entity11 program
in addition to racking up medallion qualifying miles or segments , passengers will have to spend a minimum dollar amount on tickets each year for each rung on the mileage ladder
for silver status , the spending requirement is $ 2,500
@entity23 status requires $ 5,000 in ticket purchases , $ 7,500 for platinum and $ 12,500 for diamond status
the change starts on january 1 , 2014 , for membership status in the 2015 program
" adding a revenue component to the @entity35 program ensures that our most valued customers receive the best program benefits and a more exclusive experience , " said @entity30 , vice president of the @entity11 program , in a statement
@entity40 , publisher of @entity41 expects a mixed reaction to the change among travelers , " depending on which side of the fence you find yourself on
" it 's a win for business travelers who easily qualify for the programs through company - paid flights , @entity40 said , because fewer elite members means better odds for upgrades
but travelers who have been using cheap flights as a status strategy , may get bumped down -- or out -- of the game , @entity40 said
@entity60 , a sales trainer from @entity61 , @entity62 , flies nearly every week in the mid-atlantic or the @entity64
@entity60 is a @entity65 member -- the highest level -- yet he estimates his company spends between $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 a year on his air travel , shy of the $ 12,500 requirement
by 2015 , he suspects he could drop two levels to gold status
" i will actively be looking into other airlines to see if they will match my status
