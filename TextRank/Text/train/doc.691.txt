-- a day before @entity3 illinois gov. @entity2 was busted by federal investigators on corruption charges , he dared authorities to tape his phone calls if they thought he was guilty of anything
illinois gov. @entity2 , shown here in 2003 , was known as a tireless campaigner
" if anybody wants to tape my conversations , go right ahead , feel free to do it , " @entity2 said monday outside a @entity13 window factory where workers were protesting their layoffs
his comment came in response to a reporter 's question about corruption allegations
authorities had indeed bugged the governor 's campaign office and tapped his home phone , catching him talking about alleged plans to sell the @entity30 seat left empty by president - elect @entity31
during his political career , @entity2 made headlines
a native @entity13 , he was thought of as a charismatic guy who always liked to ingratiate himself to the working man
but he was never considered a natural politician , particularly when he first began exploring a run for the governorship in 2002
his father , @entity39 , was a @entity40 immigrant who came to @entity41 after @entity42 the elder @entity2 worked in a steel mill to support his family , which was then living on the city 's then - downtrodden northwest side
as a boy , @entity2 held odd jobs -- shining shoes , delivering pizzas -- and worked in @entity52 for two summers in his teens
he used the money to enroll in @entity56 , a prestigious school in @entity57 , @entity58 , just outside of @entity13
he went on to law school at @entity60 , then went back to @entity13 after graduation to be a lawyer
@entity2 later joined the @entity63 in @entity64 -- the county in which @entity13 is located -- and built a reputation for prosecuting domestic violence cases
during his time as a lawyer , where @entity2 grew to enjoy the increasing public spotlight , he began flirting with the idea of running for office
he met his wife , @entity73 , in 1988 at a political fundraiser for her father , well - known @entity76 @entity75
@entity2 started working in the father 's office , married @entity73 and had a daughter , @entity79
they had another daughter a few years later
he served in the @entity82 from 1992 to 1996 , representing the @entity84 @entity13 district before moving on to @entity85 in 1997
during his three terms in @entity85 , he helped bring $ 240 million in federal funds to the @entity88 and an additional $ 10 million to help protect @entity90 's shoreline
he grabbed headlines in 1999 when he traveled to @entity92 with the rev. @entity93 to negotiate the release of three @entity41 soldiers
@entity2 met with then - president @entity96 , who later faced a war crimes tribunal but died of a heart attack before the proceedings were concluded
@entity2 set his sights on the governorship in 2002 with an aggressive appeal to the workaday @entity58
he portrayed himself as a regular guy who wanted to do right by the middle class
tirelessly campaigning , knocking on doors and running down - home - flavored television ads , @entity2 jokingly told voters not to worry about pronouncing his last name right
just call me @entity2 , he said
at one point , a staunch supporter of his @entity112 opponent , @entity111 , marveled to the @entity114 that he was impressed by the number of appearances @entity2 was making during the campaign
" he is one of the most energetic guys in politics today , " @entity111 said in a @entity114 profile
" if he was an athlete , they would test him for amphetamines
he would come up clean -- but they would test him
" @entity2 was able to leverage a string of endorsements from popular figures like @entity13 mayor @entity127
he also got the support of the @entity129 , the @entity130 of teachers , the @entity132 , and the @entity133
in the 2002 governor 's race , @entity2 rode to victory 7 points ahead of opponent @entity138
@entity2 commenced his re-election campaign in 2006 by promising not to raise state income or sales taxes during his second term
in may 2008 , @entity2 proposed a $ 150 million initiative to combat youth violence
in july , he pardoned 19 convicted criminals , including several who had been exonerated , and in august called a special legislative session to consider reducing state construction costs in order to increase money for schools
earlier this week , @entity2 was in the news again -- standing beside and supporting the workers suddenly laid off at the @entity13 window factory
the employees complained that the layoffs came without the 60 days ' notice required by federal law
speaking to reporters as he stood with the workers , @entity2 spoke of the need to follow the law
" we are going to do everything possible here in @entity58 to side with these workers , " he said
" and it is n't just lending them moral support , but it 's ... making sure that we have our court system enforce the federal laws so these workers are getting what they 're entitled to under the law and under what is the right thing to do
