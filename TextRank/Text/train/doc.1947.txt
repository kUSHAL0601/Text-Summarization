@entity0 -- uncertainty ruled in @entity3 wednesday as the @entity5 holy month of @entity6 began and the military said it would address the issues of this week 's deadly violence
it was n't clear whether the religious observance would calm or inflame tensions a week after a military coup
the military , which ousted president @entity14 from office last week , said that 206 people who had been detained monday during deadly clashes with security forces face charges of manslaughter , voluntary manslaughter , acts of violence and illegal possession of firearms
the suspects will remain in police custody for another 15 days while investigations into their actions continue
more than 600 people in all were detained monday
the announcement comes as the military seeks to portray itself as a stabilizing force in the splintering nation
the question remains : who 's on board ? not the @entity38 , according to the group 's high official of religious law
grand mufti @entity42 told the @entity44 news agency that he does not recognize the authority of the nation 's interim president and will not negotiate until @entity14 regains power
what is the @entity38 ? " therefore , there is no need to speak about any decrees , because they were issued by people without authority , " @entity42 said
that 's a direct reference to interim president @entity57 , who has issued a constitutional declaration giving himself limited power to make laws and outlined a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections , according to state media
the grand mufti 's position is important because the @entity38 's political wing , the @entity68 , won the most seats in parliamentary elections
@entity14 was elected president under the @entity68 banner
on wednesday , prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the @entity38 's chairman , @entity76 , and for the vice chairman of the @entity68 , @entity77 , state - run @entity73 reported
the @entity3 government said wednesday that @entity14 -- arrested last week during his ouster -- was in a safe place , and that no charges have been filed against him
" he is not free to go around , but he 's treated very well , " acting foreign minister @entity82 told @entity1 's @entity84
" and you understand that this is also for his own safety
" ' nail in coffin ' for @entity90 ? experts predict @entity3 's future interim government begins to take shape filling other key roles are @entity97 , a liberal economist who was finance minister and deputy prime minister , who will serve as the interim prime minister , and @entity101 , the @entity102 - winning diplomat , who will serve as interim vice president , the fledgling government said
@entity104 , @entity3 's official news agency , also reported that cabinet posts will be offered to the @entity68 , as well as to the @entity106
but their participation seems questionable with the @entity38 not recognizing the interim government and @entity109 -- which supported @entity14 's ouster -- withdrawing from the talks to form an interim government after this week 's deadly confrontation between the military and @entity14 supporters
fifty - one people died in the clashes outside @entity119 headquarters
the military has promised to investigate
@entity38 spokesman @entity120 said that even if invited , it could not participate in the interim government
" more than 700 of our members have been arrested , broadcasters have been shut down , and people killed in front of the @entity119 , " he said
" it is impossible to speak under the current circumstances
there is no way to have negotiations
" @entity101 : @entity14 's ouster was needed so @entity3 can not ' fail ' money pours in even as the interim government struggled to unify political support at home , it picked up the financial support of some regional heavyweights -- neither are fans of the @entity38
@entity143 's finance minister said the kingdom has pledged $ 5 billion in grants and loans to the interim government , according to the official @entity143 news agency @entity147
and the @entity148 will give $ 1 billion to @entity3 and lend it another $ 2 billion as an interest - free central bank deposit , state news agency @entity150 reported tuesday
@entity152 's support @entity57 : interim president , veteran judge , mystery man for now , the @entity156 continues to support @entity3 financially
the @entity157 has refused to describe as a coup the military 's ouster of @entity14 , who was reportedly being held under arrest at the @entity119 headquarters
doing so would require the @entity156 to suspend its $ 1.3 billion in annual military aid to @entity3
when is a coup not a coup ? it is in the interest of the @entity156 and the @entity3 people " in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination , " @entity157 spokesman @entity167 said tuesday
but he added that @entity156 officials were " cautiously encouraged " that the interim government 's plan " includes a return to democratically elected government that includes presidential and parliamentary elections
" in response to a question , @entity185 spokeswoman @entity184 told reporters that , " broadly speaking , " the administration still believes that continuing military aid is a @entity156 national security priority
but sen. @entity192 , @entity193 , has called for a suspension of military aid to @entity3
8 issues @entity3 is facing @entity1 's @entity197 reported from @entity0
@entity198 reported and wrote from @entity199 .
