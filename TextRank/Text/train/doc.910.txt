@entity0 may not be the first country you 'd associate with head banging and shredding guitar solos , but in recent years its heavy metal scene has been making a name for itself
back in june 2012 , @entity8 's @entity7 traveled to the southern @entity10 country of @entity0 to meet up with some of the country 's metal heads , and found the bands ' powerful riffs were matched by the fans ' passion -- and a penchant for the old - school metal getup of leather , studs and cowboy hats
" @entity24 is a music about power , independence and freedom , " said @entity22 , singer of local band @entity23
" that 's what i believe in -- fighting for what you believe in no matter the consequences
standing up for what you believe in and showing individuality
" @entity10 photographer @entity38 captured @entity0 's rockers in all their @entity41 - style glory as part of his " @entity45 " series of portraits
" @entity24 was seeded here [ in @entity0 ] by a classic rock band that started in the early 70s
since then , it 's evolved and grown , " he said
" in the last 10 to 20 years , it 's come to be visually composed of what it looks like now -- the guys dressed in leather
it started off with classic rock and later on more extreme forms of metal were introduced
" read this : @entity60 rappers defy bullets , death threats nearly two years after that first meeting , @entity8 caught up with @entity38 to find out how the country 's fledgling metal scene is developing
" the difference is quite extreme , " said @entity38
" before then it was largely unknown and now there seems to be a lot of interest
if you look over the internet people have a lot of interest in this new form
" the last frontier of rock and metal music is @entity10 now , is what people are saying , so they are very interested in seeing this scene grow from its , sort of , infancy and seeing where it could go
" and @entity38 thinks @entity10 bands could one day bang heads with the biggest international names in stadium rock
" i think it 's just going to take hold and grow rapidly , " he said
" @entity90 will start producing very notable international rock bands and metal bands as well and probably in 10 years ' time it wo n't be unusual to see bands from @entity90 headlining big stages and sharing stages with bands like @entity98
it 's not beyond reason -- i 'd like to see that happen
" @entity23 's @entity22 also believes that dream could be realized
" considering the feedback and support we have received from abroad , i would say that it is a strong possibility , " he said
" in fact , @entity90 already has metal bands which have toured @entity109 , and if given the chance , we will deliver
" since @entity7 met them in 2012 , @entity23 have gone on to tour @entity90 and @entity111 -- even headlining two concerts in @entity113 last year
they are now working on their fifth studio album
@entity22 says the local metal movement has gone from strength to strength in the last couple of years
" there has been a strong interest in the @entity10 metal scene , " he says
" it has grown both locally and internationally
as for the music , i would say that the band has matured and is further expanding on the @entity10 metal genre by incorporating more elements from @entity10 culture into our music
" for those @entity130 about to rock , we salute you
