@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's time to deal with another scandal involving the @entity5 — one that leads directly into the @entity7
there have been several black eyes in recent years for what was once considered one of the nation 's most celebrated law enforcement agencies
the organization responsible for protecting the safety of the president and the rest of the first family has done a poor job of protecting its own reputation
besides having to shore up lapses in @entity7 security and recovering from the resignation of its former director , @entity24 , the @entity5 now has to contend with more fallout from a story that seemed to be over and done with
when it comes to protecting itself , the @entity5 could take lessons from the @entity7
there , a cadre of aides , lawyers and spokespeople have become awfully skilled at covering up mistakes , missteps and misbehavior
and yet , the truth has a nasty habit of surfacing eventually
such as whether a 2½ - year - old scandal that @entity41 were assured was limited to @entity5 personnel might also have included someone affiliated with the @entity7
it was on april 14 , 2012 — during the last presidential election — that the news broke that @entity5 agents had brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms in @entity50 , @entity51
the agents were in @entity53 to prepare for a visit by president @entity55 , who was attending a summit on economic development in @entity58
if the idea was to encourage infusion of @entity41 dollars into the local economy , we can assume that federal agents paying young women for sex was not what organizers had in mind
you would think that one of the top law enforcement agencies in the world would be better at policing the behavior of its own personnel
in the end , nearly two dozen @entity5 agents and members of the military were punished or fired
but @entity55 administration officials — including @entity7 press secretary @entity81 — tried to contain the damage by insisting that no one from the @entity7 was involved
last week , in an astonishingly detailed front page story in the @entity85 , we learned that may not have been true
according to the @entity85 , government documents and interviews reveal that senior @entity7 aides — including @entity89 , who was then serving as @entity7 counsel — were given information by the @entity5 at the time suggesting that the scandal extended to a member of the advance team who was in @entity50 at the behest of the @entity7
@entity98 , then a 25 - year - old law student at @entity97 , was a volunteer with the @entity7 travel office who helped coordinate drivers on the trip
he was paid a per diem , not a salary , and reimbursed for expenses
still , according to the story , travel volunteers are often reminded that their conduct reflects on the president and first lady
the allegation was that @entity98 's conduct in @entity51 left something to be desired
despite the young man 's insistence , through his attorney , that he did n't engage the services of a prostitute or invite anyone to his hotel room , the information that the @entity5 shared with the @entity7 at the time suggested that @entity98 had registered a prostitute as an overnight guest
that 's a serious allegation that should have been thoroughly investigated
but was it ? the @entity5 shared its findings twice in the weeks after the scandal with top @entity7 officials , including @entity89
each time , the @entity7 counsel and other @entity7 aides conducted an interview with @entity98 and concluded that he had done nothing wrong
those who support the @entity5 agents insist the @entity7 should have dug deeper
in the end , nothing happened to @entity98 , whose father , it turns out , is a prominent and generous donor to the @entity140
at least try to look surprised
if the different outcomes seem unfair , you 're not alone
many in the @entity5 feel the same way , which probably explains how the story got out
there are reports of widespread dissension within the ranks of the agency over the @entity50 scandal
let 's not forget the politics
remember , this was all happening during a presidential election year
@entity157 , the lead investigator for the @entity158 who was tasked to look into all this , told @entity161 staffers that he was told to delay the final report of the investigation " until after the 2012 election
" @entity157 also said that , during the investigation itself , his superiors told him " to withhold and alter certain information in the report of the investigation because it was potentially embarrassing to the administration
" @entity7 spokesman @entity172 insisted , " of course there was no @entity7 interference with an @entity177 ( inspector general ) investigation
" the picture seems to be coming into focus
what happened in @entity51 showed bad judgment by @entity5 agents
if the allegations against @entity98 are true — and we ca n't be sure -- then his judgment was just as poor
and yet , despite the hijinks in @entity50 , it seems what happened next in @entity190 , on the part of @entity7 officials , was the real dereliction of duty
once again , the cover - up may have been worse than the crime
an unnamed administration official disputed that there was a cover - up , telling @entity2 the @entity7 did thoroughly review the matter and found that @entity98 did n't engage in inappropriate conduct
meanwhile , the @entity85 said @entity89 — who now practices law in the private sector — refused to talk about the case
it 's no wonder why
she is being considered to replace @entity206 as attorney general , and she probably did n't want to foul up her chances
that sort of thing could happen just by having your name linked to a scandal this unseemly
@entity89 has already done that given the ham - handed way she dealt with the allegations against @entity98
her name should be taken off the short list to replace @entity206
it 's one thing to end your tenure as attorney general under a cloud , as sometimes happens
and it 's another to begin it that way
finally , 2½ years after his fateful trip to @entity50 , @entity98 is still part of the administration
he works as a policy adviser at the @entity232 in you ca n't make this up , folks — the @entity236
even if you believe @entity98 did nothing wrong , the optics are bad
now that 's what i call a scandal .
