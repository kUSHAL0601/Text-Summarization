-- an image of the new @entity3 ambassador to @entity4 trying to buy a coffee at an airport in @entity7 has caused a stir in his adopted country
former @entity3 commerce secretary @entity10 was snapped by a passing @entity4 traveler on august 12 at a @entity13 coffee shop without any security and carrying his own backpack as he waited with his family
the traveler immediately uploaded the picture , taken on his @entity19 , to @entity4 micro-blogging site , @entity21 , where it was picked up by bloggers and the mainstream media alike in @entity4
within two days the image was re-posted more than 40,000 times
they appeared to be impressed by the understated envoy 's low key approach , which is in stark contrast to the tight security that typically follows senior @entity4 diplomats
" he 's carrying his own backpack , " exclaimed the @entity32 , while the government - run @entity33 observed that @entity10 's family " look like ordinary travelers
" meanwhile , one blogger commented , " you people out of @entity4 might think this photo is too ordinary and ca n't see much out of it , but for @entity4 it 's shocking
" the author of the image , named by @entity21 as @entity45 , later posted a message saying the @entity13 staff even refused @entity10 's attempts to exchange his discount coupon for a coffee , forcing him to pay with a credit card
this prompted some bloggers to joke that the @entity3 must really be suffering economically if its ambassador was forced to use such a voucher
other bloggers simply praised @entity10 for being the kind of official they crave
" this ( @entity10 ) is the model government official figure @entity4 citizens wish for because @entity4 does n't have officials like this , " wrote one
the outgoing @entity3 ambassador to @entity4 , @entity64 , won admirers in @entity4 for his informal style
he would often get around @entity67 on his bicycle rather than the official ambassadorial limousine
@entity0 's @entity70 contributed to this report .
