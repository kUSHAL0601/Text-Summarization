@entity0 -- @entity3 police seized a total of 1,600 kilos of bomb - making materials this week from suspected @entity8 hideouts -- the largest haul ever against the @entity11 separatist group in @entity3
authorities also arrested three @entity8 suspects this week -- including one during a seizure on thursday -- in the latest actions in a police crackdown against @entity8 despite its unilateral cease - fire declared last january 10
the @entity3 government has vowed to keep up the pressure on @entity8 because the outlawed group , listed as a terrorist organization by the @entity21 and the @entity22 , has broken cease - fires in the past
the police on tuesday arrested two men in northern @entity3 suspected of supplying explosives and bomb - making materials to @entity8
a search of their property turned up 850 kilos ( 1,870 pounds ) of bomb - making components
then on thursday , the police discovered another 750 kilos ( 1,650 pounds ) of explosives and components at various suspected hideouts , and arrested a third suspect
the two seizures totaled about 3,520 pounds
@entity8 is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for @entity11 independence , many of those due to car bombs and package bombs
last month in @entity46 , police arrested the suspected military chief of @entity8 , in charge of commandos who carry out the bombings
in recent years , the police have arrested in succession a series of suspected @entity8 military chiefs as @entity8 replacements step in to fill the vacant position at the top
also last month , in northern @entity3 , police arrested four key @entity8 suspects who authorities said had tried to operate under police radar , carrying on ostensibly law - abiding lives but secretly working for @entity8
police seized 200 kilograms ( 440 pounds ) of explosives in those raids
top government officials have said @entity8 appears to be weaker than ever , but they have warned that the group still has the capacity to kill
the @entity70 government and the main opposition conservative party have said @entity8 's current unilateral cease - fire is not enough , and that only a commitment to permanently end the violence and lay down weapons would suffice
deputy prime minister @entity76 said last month , " the government 's anti-terrorist policy has not changed at all because @entity8 has not definitively abandoned its weapons
and as long as it does n't , the police will continue to arrest them , one after another
