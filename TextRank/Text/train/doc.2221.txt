-- despite the worldwide economic downturn it seems there is one commodity that remains as valuable as ever
with media companies around the world paying record sums for broadcasting rights , the @entity10 -- with its array of world - class players -- continues to prove a hugely marketable
@entity13 won an @entity10 competition that was beamed into 600m homes
with the new 2009 - 2010 football season approaching , the @entity10 appears to have usurped every other domestic league as the sporting product of choice for most international broadcasters
the fact that companies are still willing to hang their financial hats on the @entity10 , despite increased global uncertainty , is a testament to the large audiences the thrills and excitement of the competition can draw
and , with the division 's international broadcasting rights for the next three years currently up for tender , there appears no sign that financial constraints are hindering the bidding process
a @entity10 spokesman told @entity0 : " currently we have 39 international rights broadcast holders , beaming the @entity10 into 211 countries worldwide
" @entity10 matches are played into 600 million homes around the world , with an estimated audience of four billion viewers and there is no sign that the huge interest in the product is subsiding in any way
" the spokesman added : " the quality of the @entity10 stimulates interest to markets everywhere and attracts audiences from all over the globe
" it 's a very polished product
the grounds are full , the atmosphere is passionate and the top clubs attract supporters from every corner of the globe
" if broadcasters are going to invest in any sporting property , they are going to choose the one that brings in the biggest audiences , which in turn makes it the most attractive for advertisers
" the @entity10 is touted by many as the " most competitive " in @entity73 , but pinning all you financial strategy on one product is a dangerous game -- as one broadcaster recently found to its cost
@entity81 - based broadcaster @entity80 , which also had major audiences in @entity84 and the @entity85 , had an impressive portfolio of sporting rights and events at its disposal
but the company 's purchase of 46 @entity10 matches , for Â£ 131 million ( $ 215m ) was the centerpiece of its coverage for two seasons -- a figure they hoped to recoup from customer subscriptions
but when the company lost the rights to half of their games , meaning they could show only 23 matches of the upcoming campaign the @entity105 operation was forced to cease trading due to a projected loss in subscriptions
@entity85 broadcaster , @entity110 , quickly snapped up the rights in a bid to increase their market share , a policy that makes sense according to football business expert @entity117 , of sport sponsorship company @entity118
" not only is the quality of the product excellent , but the fact that the @entity10 is full of players from all over the world makes it both viable and successful , " @entity117 said
" unlike some other major leagues , it is not a foregone conclusion who wins the @entity10
there is a greater distribution of top players across the teams than in any other league and that makes it both interesting and exciting
" in recent seasons we have seen the growth in popularity in @entity139 and @entity140
in the past , countries like @entity142 have tried to down - play the @entity10 in an attempt to promote their own domestic competitions
" however , the demand and popularity of the league has been too great for these countries not to broadcast matches , and now they embrace it completely
