editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the @entity4 , a libertarian public policy research foundation , and editor - in - chief of the @entity7
before joining @entity7 , he was special assistant / adviser to the @entity8 and practiced law at @entity10 and @entity11
earlier , @entity2 clerked for judge @entity12 of the @entity13
@entity2 says the @entity15 appointment is a case of identity politics rather than a choice on the merits
( @entity20 ) -- in picking @entity15 , president @entity21 has confirmed that identity politics matter to him more than merit
while @entity15 exemplifies the @entity24 , she would not have even been on the short list if she were not @entity26
she is not one of the leading lights of the federal judiciary , and far less qualified for a seat on the @entity31 than judges @entity32 and @entity33 or solicitor general @entity34
to be sure , @entity15 has a compelling story : a daughter of working - class @entity37 raised in @entity40 public housing projects , diagnosed with diabetes at 8 , losing her father at 9 , accolades at @entity44 and @entity45 , ending up on the federal bench
still , in over 10 years on the @entity47 , she has not issued any important decisions or made a name for herself as a legal scholar or particularly respected jurist
in picking a case to highlight during his introduction of the nominee , president @entity21 had to go back to her days as a trial judge and a technical ruling that ended the 1994 - 95 baseball strike
moreover , @entity15 has a mixed reputation among lawyers who have practiced before her , some questioning her abilities as a judicial craftsman , others her erratic temperament , according to a piece by @entity65 in @entity66 , which itself has come in for criticism
such anecdotal criticism is to be taken with a grain of salt -- while justice @entity71 's bench - side manner is more vinegar than honey , even his detractors recognize his brilliance -- but it does need to be investigated
so , too , do certain statements she made in presentations at @entity78 and @entity79 , respectively , the former arguing that a @entity81 necessarily sees the law differently than a white man , the latter suggesting that , at least to some degree , judges make rather than interpret law
again , this does not mean that @entity15 is unqualified to be a judge -- or less qualified to be a @entity31 justice than , say , @entity91
it also does not detract from the history she would make as the first @entity26 @entity31 nominee -- if you do n't count @entity96 , a descendant of @entity98 jews
but a @entity31 nomination is not a lifetime achievement award , and should not be treated as an opportunity to practice affirmative action
ironically , it is race - based employment practices of another kind that will likely get this nomination in hottest water
@entity15 was on a panel that summarily affirmed the dismissal of claims brought by firefighters , including one @entity26 , whose promotions were denied because they would be based on a ( race - neutral ) exam whose results did n't yield the " right " racial mix. @entity120 , the @entity110 appellate panel issued a cursory " unpublished " opinion that failed to grapple with the complex legal issues presented in the case
@entity15 's colleague @entity124 , a @entity125 , excoriated the panel , without expressing a view on the merits of the case
@entity124 ' dissent from the @entity47 's decision not to rehear the case caught the @entity31 's attention and , based on the oral argument , the court will probably reverse @entity15 's panel when it rules on the case next month
ireport.com : @entity15 ' the new face of @entity139 ' we are thus likely to have the unusual scenario of a @entity31 decision having a direct personal effect on a nominee 's confirmation process , which will not only force @entity15 onto the defensive but cost the president significant political capital
it will also show that @entity21 's calls for " empathy , " echoed by @entity15 's citing her personal experiences as a @entity81 , ring hollow
if @entity110 , a dyslexic fireman who sacrificed significant time and money and was denied promotion solely for his skin color , is not an empathetic figure , i 'm not sure who is
and that is the larger point : a jurisprudence of empathy is the antithesis of the rule of law
as then - judge @entity167 said at his confirmation hearing : " if the @entity170 says that the little guy should win , then the little guy 's going to win in the court before me
but if the @entity170 says that the big guy should win , well then the big guy 's going to win , because my obligation is to the @entity170
" in any event , @entity177 @entity176 will now have to decide what posture to take : combative or deferential , political or analytical
with the president still at the height of his popularity and solid @entity186 control of the @entity177 ( even without @entity180 and @entity181 ) , the @entity176 is unlikely to sustain a filibuster or even , unless outrage over the @entity190 case grows , vote @entity15 down
ireport.com : @entity15 pick a ' gimmick ' what they should do instead is force a full public debate about constitutional interpretation , probing @entity15 's judicial philosophy and refusing to accept nonresponsive answers that mouth platitudes or avoid taking firm legal positions
now is the time to show the @entity139 people the stark differences between the two parties on one of the few issues on which the stated @entity176 view continues to command strong and steady support
if the party is serious about constitutionalism and the rule of law , it should use this opportunity for education , not grandstanding
and if @entity216 insist on playing identity politics , i suggest a two - word response : @entity219 , the @entity220 immigrant with his own rags - to - riches story whose nomination to the @entity216 successfully filibustered , effectively preventing @entity223 from naming the first @entity26 @entity31 justice
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
