-- @entity1 was driving to dinner with @entity3 last month when she made a wrong turn that put the women in front of a @entity8 building in @entity9 , @entity10
in a flash , @entity1 remembered everything she 'd learned about the brutal murders connected to that place
they had been jurors in the trial of a man who , after extorting money from a woman there , killed her and her children
the former jurors ended up at that bank on the way to meet the deceased woman 's family for the first time
" they were worried that we had to go through what they went through , " said @entity1 , 56
" they were very thankful , and sorry that we had to go through all of that , but certainly we would have all done it again
" jurors begin deliberations in @entity37 trial at that bank , in july 2007 , @entity38 had forced @entity38 to withdraw $ 15,000 , according to police , while her family was being held hostage at her home
@entity38 and @entity38 were charged with killing @entity45 and her two young daughters
the children 's father , prominent endocrinologist @entity38 , was tied up and severely beaten but escaped
@entity38 was convicted and sentenced to death ; @entity52 's trial is still to come
the path that led to 8 terrifying hours for @entity10 family serving on a jury for a murder trial such as that of @entity38 , or of @entity58 , who is charged with seven counts in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , can be emotionally and physically taxing
and after a trial is over , some jurors report symptoms reminiscent of post-traumatic stress disorder , such as flashbacks and intrusive thoughts
whether you 're in the courtroom or at home watching tv , repeated exposure to the details of a horrific events can lead to a phenomenon called vicarious traumatization -- you 're so connected to a tragedy that you feel emotional trauma as if you 'd been directly involved
" to see the images that they 're seeing of this is overwhelming , " @entity81 , a psychologist at @entity82 , said of the @entity84 trial jurors
" everyone 's going to have a reason to be impacted by this case
whether or not you have children of your own , there 's no way out of being profoundly influenced
" jury service is especially difficult because jurors ca n't share their thoughts about the case or the experience with anyone until after the trial , said @entity101 , a consultant for the @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104
" one of the best ways to alleviate stress and anxiety is to talk it through with somebody else , " she said
" while the jurors are in trial , that 's problematic , because they 're not technically supposed to talk about anything that happens in the courtroom with anyone
for the length of the trial , they 're having to just internalize everything that they 're hearing and they 're seeing
" in the @entity84 trial , jurors are sequestered , meaning they are barred from any contact with anyone outside the courtroom , and can not read or watch news of any kind
when confined to interacting among themselves , jurors sometimes form a support system , @entity81 said
" to cope , to survive , actually , you form these new families
it 's a very good survival technique , " she said
" the problem is , when you start getting things like hung juries , and all the challenges around that , you can end up in a very problematic situation
" the @entity38 trial jurors were not sequestered , meaning they could go home at the end of the day and be with their families
@entity1 takes care of her 90 - year - old father and probably would n't have been able to join a sequestered jury ; but in a way , isolation might have been better , she said
" in some ways , it might be easier because of the pressure from everyone on the outside that they know you 're on the jury
they really want to ask you [ about it ] , " @entity1 said
@entity1 thought she would approach the trial with an open mind : she would sit and analyze
she had no idea how much it had affected her until a break in the trial before the sentencing phase
she developed a fever and was sick during the entire time off
going into the next stage of the trial , she had a new strategy : pay attention to her own needs , too
she had massages , took steam baths and relaxed in other ways
" you really do have to take care of yourself , because it 's real
all this stuff , once you take it into your consciousness , it 's real , " she said
even though they got to return to their normal lives at the end of each day , @entity1 felt her group of jurors became a family , too , during the nearly two months of the trial
" after everything was over , i felt almost , like , a loss
they were my everything for those months , " she said
@entity3 , 59 , had already been through breast cancer when she was selected for the @entity38 trial
she believes her near - death illness and her age made her emotionally stronger as a juror than she would have been in her younger years
but the stories and images stayed with her after the trial
she began to have dreams that the @entity204 daughters were alive and that she took care of them as if they were her own children
and when she returned to her job as a teacher , about a month after the trial ended , she sometimes saw a flashback of the @entity204 girls ' picture in her fifth - grade classroom
" just thinking about what it was like right before they set the fire
... this happens periodically , i see this image of the girls being burned , " she said
" something that i see will trigger the memory of the trial and the pictures
" and when it comes to a tragic case such as this or @entity58 's , with a lengthy trial , it 's important to seek help when you need it afterward , @entity81 said
" i think that these jurors need to be very aware that when you get off a case like this , you may need some counseling
this is going to bring up different things for different people , depending on your life story , " she said
when the @entity38 trial was over , jurors had a debriefing with counselors
some sought counseling afterward , @entity1 said
and some , including @entity1 and @entity3 , have remained friends
" when we get together , we do n't need to talk about it
we all just understand , " she said
the trial of @entity38 , the other man accused of participating in the murders of @entity45 and her children , is scheduled for september
the lead - up to it brings back more memories for @entity1 , but she still plans to attend at least part of the trial because she feels that she needs to hear that side of the story
to this day , @entity1 keeps a photo of @entity45 and the two daughters , @entity263 , 17 , and @entity264 , 11 , on her desk
she has n't been able to go to their memorial garden , which is where the house they died in used to stand , but she hopes to go this summer with flowers
" it 's sort of like opening a wound a little
your spirit goes into a place that you were before , " she said
" there 's a lot of pain there
