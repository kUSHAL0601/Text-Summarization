-- most of those killed on the helicopter that crashed in eastern @entity5 overnight were a part of the fighting force known as the @entity8 , two @entity2 government officials said
the men who died were not the ones who killed @entity13 in may , but they belonged to the same unit , a military official said
the group has its origins in @entity18 , when the @entity2 realized that to invade @entity19 , it needed savvy , quick - thinking fighters who could perform reconnaissance at sea
beyond tactical expertise , the @entity8 -- short for @entity23 , @entity24 and land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength
according to the @entity8 web site , they became known as jack - of - all - trade troops , able to survey @entity31 's @entity30 disguised as @entity31 nationals in 1945 or conduct demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the @entity37 coast during the @entity38
it was the @entity8 who were sent to kill @entity13 in @entity40 , ending a decade - long manhunt
the @entity8 did not get their name until after president @entity43 spoke about his admiration for special forces troops and his hope that the @entity2 military would better enhance its capacity for unconventional warfare , counter guerrilla and clandestine operations
there was a new and pressing need for more advanced military techniques during the time
among other missions , the @entity8 were deployed to act as advisers and train @entity59 commandos
@entity60 was the first @entity2 war to be broadcast widely on television and media , and woven into popular culture for mainstream consumption
it solidified the image of the seals as the ultimate tough guy , a reputation burnished by reports of @entity8 ' ability to do face - to - face combat with @entity74 and stories of their work with the @entity77
the relationship between @entity2 's spy agency and its elite troops was crucial to gaining real - time intelligence for missions sometimes carried out at the last minute -- perhaps an asset more important now than ever , experts have said
the war against @entity86 is just as much about obtaining reliable intelligence as it is winning on the battlefield
@entity8 victories have been many
during @entity60 , they performed a covert operation called the @entity92 which captured @entity74 sympathizers
in the @entity95 , @entity8 teams conducted missions to counter @entity98 mine - laying boats
the first military flag officer to set foot in @entity5 after september 11 , 2001 , was a seal in charge of all special operations for @entity103 , according to the @entity8 history page on its web site
the site says @entity8 commanded @entity107 which oversaw the @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 at the beginning of @entity112 which carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions , destroyed more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons , identified enemy personnel and conducted operations that searched for terrorists trying to flee the country by sea
the largest deployment of seals in the group 's history came during the @entity126 , with @entity8 directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the @entity129 and the off - shore gas and oil terminals , clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country
several high - value terrorist targets were captured by the @entity8 , including @entity136 , the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four @entity140 guards in @entity141 , @entity142 , in 2004
another recent high - profile mission came in 2009 when a seal team rescued the @entity2 captain of the cargo ship @entity147 , which had been hijacked by @entity149 pirates off @entity149 's coast
@entity8 snipers were on the deck of a ship and fired simultaneously three times , hitting three pirates who were holding the captain
ultimate test seal training is " the ultimate test for a guy , " said @entity161 , a former seal with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in @entity164 , the @entity165 and @entity5
it 's social , physical and psychological and tests how well the man can work with others given intense pressure and pain
seals train between 18 and 24 months , with the pinnacle of training coming during @entity177 , five days in which trainees are constantly cold , hungry , sleep deprived and wet
during @entity180 week , instructors deprive the participants of sleep , then let them hit the rack just long enough for @entity184 to begin , said @entity185 , a former seal who ran the sniper program at the @entity188 and was part of combat missions in @entity142 and @entity5
instructors are constantly yelling , " go ahead , quit if you like ! " many do
the attrition rate for @entity8 training is about 90 percent , @entity161 and @entity185 said
most recruits drop out long before @entity177 because they ca n't take the training , which involves running 15 miles , topped with a 2 - mile open water swim and other intense physical conditioning , @entity185 said
" every day is like climbing @entity198 , " @entity161 said
" you just keep doing what 's in front of you
you do n't look up
" training instructors make you feel like " you 're part of an @entity204 tribe , " @entity161 said
" there 's a lot of back patting and verbal reinforcement
you feel like you 're part of something and you 're doing great things
but they definitely let you know when you 're not doing something right
" the discipline from seal training was intensely satisfying to @entity217 in his early 20s
he had gone to college , and though he was very bright , he was spending more time working out than on his class work
four walls and books just were n't his thing
despite unimpressive grades , at 23 he got a job working in home mortgages making $ 63,000 a year
then one day he read an article about the seals in @entity230
" i enlisted in the @entity108 immediately , " @entity161 said
" i asked the recruiter , ' what is the fastest track to becoming a seal ? i 'll take that
' " though he wo n't discuss specific areas of countries where he 's carried out missions , he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock - ups of a targeted location .
