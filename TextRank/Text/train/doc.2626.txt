@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity4 professor claims he has identified the parts of the brain that help to make someone a good leader
@entity9 is using @entity10 to find out what parts of the brain are involved in leadership
@entity9 , an associate professor at the @entity14 at @entity15 , also says he can use neuroscientific techniques to help people improve the skills that play a part in leadership
@entity21 uses electroencephalography ( @entity10 ) to produce a " brain map " of his subjects
by attaching electrodes to their heads , he says he can measure electrical activity generated by neurons in their brain
much of his work has focused on calibrating the @entity10 data with standard psychometric tests , and now @entity9 says that just by looking at someone 's brain map he can predict their capacity for certain traits linked to leadership
" from someone 's brain map i can tell if someone would rank high , medium or low on a psychometric assessment of their transformational leadership , and just that is an earth - shattering finding , " he told @entity2
he has been working with the @entity4 military to produce a model that will allow them to scan soldiers ' brains for complexity
the idea is that more complex brains produce better situational awareness and adaptive thinking -- essential skills for the modern soldier , who must be able to transition from front - line combat to nation building
he refers to traits like complexity and transformational leadership as antecedents to leadership itself
but for @entity21 , the ability to assess these skills is only half the story
what really excites him is the possibility of brain training and improving leadership skills
" if you could only assess and not develop then it 's only an exercise in social engineering , and that 's of no interest to me , " he said
@entity9 explained that brains can be trained using positive and negative reinforcement , in the same way that disorders like @entity84 are treated
a subject is wired to software programmed to recognize " correct " functioning of a specific part of the brain
if the brain is n't performing correctly , there is a negative reinforcement , such as a noise emitted from a speaker at an unpleasant frequency
" the brain is amazing at adjusting so it does n't get the negative feedback , " he told @entity2
but others think it may prove difficult to develop something as intangible as leadership
dr @entity104 , a member of the @entity105 at @entity106 , in @entity0 , told @entity2 , " even if you find differences in the brains of people with different leadership abilities , it 's very difficult to say if that difference is just related to leadership
" it could be due to all sorts of things that might be fairly tangentially related to leadership
" " leadership is such a fuzzy quality that it 's hard to say conclusively what you are changing , " @entity104 added
" you might change things that contribute to leadership , for example people might learn to stay calmer in conflict situations , but is that the same as saying you 're improving the leadership center of your brain ? " so , what 's inside the brain of a born leader ? interestingly , intelligence is not a requirement
" there 's zero correlation between iq and leadership , " @entity9 told @entity2
" emotion control has a lot to do with leadership
people who lead very well tend to have a much more coherent brain on the emotional , right side , and more differentiated brain on the more rational , left side , that can assess more different options
" @entity9 says that although he has identified brain profiles for antecedents to leadership , he stresses that before he can produce a set of exercises designed to improve leadership itself , he must develop a " leadership norm " -- a standard for what makes a good leader
he has currently analyzed the brains of between 200 and 225 subjects , including bankers and military leaders , and says he must test twice that amount before he has his " norm
" but he said plenty of people are already going to neurotherapists to train their brain for skills linked to leadership , such as decision - making , cognition , and memory retrieval , and @entity9 says he 'll soon be able to use neuotherapy techniques to develop leadership itself
" at some point in the next 18 months we 'll have a seminal paper out that says we 've done this
we 're not there yet but i 've seen it in the lab. " if that happens , budding @entity183 might be queuing up at neurotherapists to plug themselves in and turn themselves into the business brains of the future .
