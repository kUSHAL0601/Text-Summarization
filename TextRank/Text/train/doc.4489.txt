@entity4 teenager @entity3 's inspiring speech at the @entity5 on every child 's right to go to school is just the beginning of a major push on education , former @entity1 prime minister @entity0 said saturday
@entity3 -- who on friday gave her first public remarks since she was shot by the @entity13 last year for advocating that all girls should go to school -- will return to the @entity5 in september to press her point , according to a statement from @entity0 's @entity17 at @entity19 campaign
accompanied by @entity0 , she will address an education summit of world leaders during the week of the full @entity23 at @entity5 headquarters in @entity25 , it said
there , the 16 - year - old will demand action on behalf of 57 million children around the world who have no access to any schooling
meanwhile , @entity0 , who 's the @entity5 special envoy for global education , will travel to @entity4 in july to discuss education issues with the country 's new government
he also intends to visit @entity37 , @entity38 's most populous nation , in the fall
between them , @entity4 and @entity37 have 16 million children out of school , the statement said , most of them girls
@entity3 's journey from near death to recovery @entity0 and @entity3 met with the @entity5 ' @entity4 high commissioner on friday to discuss the plight of more than 5 million children who are out of school in the country , the statement said
" @entity3 's speech was just the start of a momentous push for change in the run up to 2015 , to deal with the education emergency , " @entity0 said
the @entity58 on education set by @entity5 member states in 2000 pledged to have every child in school by 2015
in her speech friday , @entity3 said the masked gunmen who shot her in the head in october , who also injured two other girls , had not silenced her ambitions but rather made her stronger
@entity0 : the story of @entity3 's friend " they thought that the bullets would silence us , but they failed , " she said
" and then , out of that silence came thousands of voices
" she said that she does n't seek revenge against the @entity13 , who have threatened to hunt her down again and end her life , and that she 's against no one
@entity3 's global voice stronger than ever " i am here to speak up for the right of education of every child , " she said
" i want education for the sons and the daughters of all the extremists , especially the @entity13
" she also reflected on the very real dangers faced by teachers and students in @entity4
earlier this summer , a teacher was gunned down in front of her son as she drove into her all - girl school
a school principal was killed and his students severely injured when a bomb was tossed onto a school playground at a girls ' school in @entity100 in march
in january , five teachers were killed near the town of @entity103 in the volatile northern @entity105 province , the @entity5 says
and , in june , a suicide bomber blew up a bus carrying 40 schoolgirls as it made its way to a girls ' campus in @entity112
the speech , given on her 16th birthday , was not about her , @entity3 added , but rather to give a voice to all the voiceless millions around the world fighting for their rights
" let us wage a global struggle against illiteracy , poverty and terrorism , and let us pick up our books and pens
they are our most powerful weapons , " she said
" one child , one teacher , one pen and one book can change the world
education is the only solution
" the world 's other @entity139
