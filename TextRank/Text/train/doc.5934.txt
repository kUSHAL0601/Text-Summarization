@entity0 -- @entity2 postponed a vote on tuesday on a controversial forest code , which has pitted farmers and ranchers against environmentalists
according to state - run @entity9 , the vote was rescheduled for next tuesday so the government can try to secure support for the current text
lawmakers are still sharply divided , with the rural lobby in @entity2 demanding more protection for farmers who have cleared land and environmentalists accusing the government of repealing landmark laws
over the past decade , @entity21 has cracked down on clear - cutting , especially in the biodiverse @entity23 rain forest , reducing the rate of deforestation by 80 %
environmentalists are concerned that some of those gains could be threatened if the new legislation is passed
the bill eases limits on deforestation and extends an amnesty to some developers who cut down trees illegally in the past
still , it is more eco-friendly than an earlier version of the bill that was supported by the rural lobby in @entity2
the @entity23 rain forest covers a huge area , roughly half as large as the @entity43 , with about 60 % of it in @entity21
it is estimated that nearly a fifth of the @entity21 forest has been lost since 1970
initially cleared by loggers , much of it was turned into pastures and farmlands as @entity21 went from being a food importer to a global agricultural powerhouse .
