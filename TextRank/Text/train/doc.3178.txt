-- it is a rare , strange day when @entity3 @entity2 vote to block billions in tax cuts
but that 's what happened thursday when they chose to freeze a massive tax credit package in order to protest how @entity10 are running the chamber
by a vote of 53 - 40 , the @entity12 , which would extend $ 85 billion in tax credits , failed to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster
only one @entity2 , sen. @entity17 of @entity18 , voted with @entity10 to advance the measure
the rest of the @entity2 votes were " no , " as @entity2 vented anger that @entity10 have refused to allow votes on their amendments to this and most other bills in the past year
" this is bigger than any one bill , " @entity27 leader @entity27 said on the floor
" what ( @entity10 are ) doing is muzzling the people of this country , a gag order on the people we were sent here to represent
" " it 's time to act as the @entity3 should act and allow ( both sides ) the opportunity to express their view , " echoed sen. @entity38 , @entity2 of @entity39
the pushback comes as the @entity3 struggles to find a way to operate
traditional processes and procedures for working through sharp divides have broken down in the past year
democrats , frustrated with @entity2 for blocking presidential nominees , changed a significant piece of the filibuster rule
triggering the so - called " nuclear option , " majority leader @entity53 and @entity10 made it easier to get around @entity2 objections
that raised hostility behind the scenes to a new level
at the same time , @entity2 are also furious that @entity10 will not let bills have a so - called " open " process , where senators can propose amendments and get a vote on their idea
that is far from unique to @entity53 or this @entity3
@entity2 have used the same tactic to choose friendly amendments when they were in the majority
but after months of tension and in a bitter midterm election year where they want to rail against @entity10 , @entity2 decided that thursday was the day to take a stand on the process issues in the @entity3
@entity53 fired back , insisting that @entity2 are the ones causing obstruction in the @entity3 and are doing so for political reasons
" it should not be lost that @entity2 senators are continuing their agenda by just saying no , " the @entity81 senator said after the vote
" i wonder who called them today to kill this bill ? no matter the excuse , @entity2 continue to wage war against common sense
" @entity53 also made sure to point out that , with thursday 's vote , @entity2 were blocking their own cause
" that 's what just happened , @entity2 just voted against tax cuts , " @entity53 said
what happens next ? the bill to extend the tax cuts is frozen temporarily but not dead
@entity53 suggested that both sides should take the weekend to think about their next moves .
