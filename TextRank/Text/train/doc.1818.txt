-- @entity2 's @entity1 has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country 's assistant interior minister last thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack
a @entity2 man reads a newspaper featuring a front - page story on thursday 's attack
the disclosures reported by the country 's official news agency were highly unusual
the agency , @entity17 , reported the attacker , @entity18 , a wanted @entity2 militant who had been hiding in @entity19 , got in touch with @entity2 authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to @entity2 prince @entity24 , the assistant minister of interior for security affairs
after arriving back in @entity2 , @entity18 spoke by phone to @entity24 , who agreed to see him during a @entity28 reception at his home in the city of @entity31
according to a transcript provided by @entity17 , during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of @entity28
@entity24 is quoted as telling @entity18 that " one should be careful ; evil people would like to exploit all of you
now only you to fear @entity40 and come home
" later in the conversation , @entity18 asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with @entity24
@entity18 , escorted by security , was transported to @entity31 , where he met with the prince at his palace
during the meeting , @entity18 explained to @entity24 that other @entity2 militants in @entity19 also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince
according to @entity17 , a call was then placed to one of the militants in @entity19
while the prince was on the phone , @entity18 blew himself up , @entity17 reported
@entity24 , who is also the son of the country 's interior minister , was lightly injured in the attack
@entity2 @entity59 was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on @entity63
the king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly
prince @entity24 answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake
@entity17 adds that " the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident
however , the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that , for security considerations , will not be announced at this time
" @entity18 's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by @entity2 in february
at the time the list was released , @entity2 asked @entity81 for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted @entity2 on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against @entity2 from abroad
the announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose
it is also unusual for @entity2 to ask for help in finding them
some of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from @entity97 , returned to @entity2 , and had then gone through a @entity99 reeducation program run by the @entity1 , before fleeing to @entity19 and taking up terrorist activity once more
@entity2 has been battling terrorism since 2003 , when @entity102 launched a series of attacks inside the @entity105
in the security crackdown that followed , @entity18 , like many other wanted @entity2 militants , fled to @entity19
earlier this year , @entity108 and @entity109 merged to form " @entity110
" @entity110 , which operates out of @entity19 , claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against @entity24
in august , @entity2 's @entity1 announced that over the past year , 44 @entity102 suspects across the country had been arrested
while the @entity1 is calling the attempted assassination an " action of treachery and treason " , @entity17 reports that the @entity119 will not change its " open - door policy " of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular , " those citizens residing outside the country " who wish to " take advantage of the state - sponsored program of advice and care
