@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities trying to stave off meltdowns at an earthquake - damaged nuclear power plant reported more grim news tuesday as radiation levels soared following another explosion at an overheating reactor
the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the @entity16 nuclear power plant remains " very high , " @entity3 prime minister @entity11 said tuesday
in addition to an explosion at the no. 2 reactor , the building housing the no. 4 unit -- which had been shut down before friday 's earthquake -- was burning tuesday morning , chief cabinet secretary @entity17 announced
the plant 's owners , the @entity26 , evacuated all but about 50 of their workers from the plant following tuesday 's explosion at the no. 2 reactor
radiation levels at the plant have increased to " levels that can impact human health , " @entity17 said -- between 100 and 400 millisieverts , or as much as 160 times higher than the average dose of radiation a typical person receives from natural sources in a year
evacuations have already been ordered for anyone living within 20 kilometers ( 12.5 miles ) of the plant , and @entity17 said anyone between 20 and 30 kilometers ( between 12.5 - 18.6 miles ) should remain indoors
at least 500 residents were believed to have remained within the 20 - kilometer radius monday evening , @entity17 said
@entity17 spoke more than four hours after an explosion at the no. 2 reactor , the third blast in four days
the cooling system at that unit was damaged by a hydrogen explosion at the no. 3 unit on monday , and workers had been attempting to keep temperatures at unit 2 in check by pumping seawater into the reactor ever since
the " explosive impact " took place shortly after 6 a.m. tuesday ( 5 p.m. monday et ) , @entity26 said
pressure readings indicated some damage to the no. 2 reactor 's suppression pool , a donut - shaped reservoir at the base of the reactor containment vessel
" we are continuing the water injection into the pressure vessels , but the operators who are not directly engaged in this operation are being evacuated to safer locations , " a @entity26 executive told reporters at a news conference tuesday morning
monday 's hydrogen explosion at reactor @entity79 injured 11 people , @entity3 authorities said
a similar hydrogen explosion on saturday blew the roof off the containment structure around the no. 1 reactor and hurt four people
@entity17 said earlier that he could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at all three troubled reactors at the plant
the buildup of hydrogen in the reactor vessels is " the first sign that things are going haywire , " said @entity96 , a physicist who used to work at the @entity98 's @entity97 in @entity99
the release of radioactive material such as cesium , a reactor byproduct that has been detected outside the @entity16 plant , is another , he said
" what is fairly clear , from the release of hydrogen and the fission products , is that all of these reactors have probably had fuel rods exposed for significant periods of time over a portion of their length , " @entity96 told @entity1
@entity3 's @entity117 said tuesday that up to 2.7 meters ( 8.8 feet ) of the no. 2 reactor 's control rods -- about half -- have been uncovered
authorities began pumping a mix of sea water and boron into the no. 2 reactor after monday 's explosion , as they have been doing with units 1 and 3
but the pump ran low on fuel when workers left it unattended , and the water soon burned off and exposed the reactor 's fuel rods , allowing them to emit levels of heat and steam that can melt the reactor 's core
when that problem was resolved , @entity17 said , a new problem sent the water levels plummeting again
a valve that was supposed to be open to allow the heat and steam to escape was closed , causing pressure to build up inside the reactor building , according to @entity26
but pumping had resumed by early tuesday , @entity17 said
if the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario that experts who have spoken to @entity1 say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant , and possibly release radiation into the atmosphere or water
that could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems , experts say
but @entity96 said that while it is likely the reactor cores have been damaged , " it will have to get a lot hotter " for the dense uranium in the reactor 's fuel rods to melt down
that would give authorities and the surrounding population time to prepare
" i believe they would be able to tell from various signals having to do with release of radioactivity and other things that things were a lost cause , you might say , and they might start initiating additional evacuations , " @entity96 said
" there would be warning , but we 're talking massive , massive responses required , " he added
about 200,000 people have evacuated the area following a government order over the weekend
and low levels of radiation were detected at least as far as 100 miles ( about 160 kilometers ) northeast of the plant , according to the @entity194 , which repositioned ships and planes after detecting low - level " airborne radioactivity
" tests also detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 @entity194 helicopter crew members when they returned to the aircraft carrier @entity204 , but no further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water , the @entity194 said
the @entity194 said the maximum potential radiation dose received by any ship personnel when it passed through the area was " less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks , soil , and the sun. " the @entity220 has sent a team of 10 experts from the @entity219 , including two cooling experts , to assist the @entity3 , the @entity219 announced monday night
two were sent saturday , and the rest left monday , the agency reported
@entity219 chairman @entity226 said @entity3 has asked for additional types of equipment that will help provide water and keep the reactors cool
but based on the reactor design and nature of the accident , there is very low probability of any harmful radiation levels reaching the @entity220 , including @entity237 and @entity220 @entity238 territories , @entity226 said
@entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 , and @entity242 contributed to this report .
