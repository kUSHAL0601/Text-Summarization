-- @entity1 may have ended up in tears , but he 's not upset with the reporter who pushed him to that point
" i was really surprised
i mean , i felt like it was me , not her , " he told @entity0 about @entity7 reporter @entity6
after @entity1 won a bronze in the men 's @entity12 alpine skiing race sunday , @entity9 asked him about his emotions and stuck with the questions after @entity1 teared up talking about his brother , @entity16 , a snowboarder with his own @entity18 aspirations who died last year at 29
@entity1 -- who ended up unable to speak , doubled over and crying -- says he does n't blame her for asking the questions
" she asked questions that i feel like with her knowledge of my brother and the situation , i felt like were pretty normal questions , " @entity1 said
" i 've known @entity6 for a long time , and i think she 's really comfortable with me , and i felt terrible that she was getting just massacred in the press and in social media
" @entity1 's brother was in a motorcycle accident in 2006
he suffered several seizures after that but still dreamed of competing in the @entity18
" that was part of the reason why i was staying with it , and coming back to continue to race , so we would be here together and , you know , hopefully win together , " @entity1 said
winning was an incredible way to honor his brother , he said , which made sunday great and painful
" in the end , people will sort of see that it was more me just dealing with all these emotions and the build - up of several years of very tough personal life stuff , " @entity1 said
@entity49 triumphs in @entity12 as @entity1 gets historic bronze @entity0 's @entity51 and @entity52 contributed to this report .
