-- @entity2 's narrow victory at the @entity3 secured a slice of golfing history as he became the first @entity7 - born player to win on the @entity8
the 37 - year - old from @entity10 sank an eight foot par putt on the final hole to win by a shot from @entity15 @entity14 , and become the first qualifier to triumph on the @entity8 in 24 years
@entity2 lost his tour card in july but shot a final round 67 at @entity18 to finish on 20 - under - par and scoop the top prize of $ 918,000
" i told my caddie , ' we 've got nothing to lose this week
just go out there and try and win it ' , " @entity2 told the official @entity8 website
" guys are going to be out there trying to secure their @entity29 spots or whatever
i do n't have a card
i do n't have anything
just go out there and free - wheel it , and that 's what i did this week
" i 'm pretty sure it 's going to be huge back home , " @entity2 added
" my in - laws called my wife saturday and said the coverage was just unreal with me leading
i know there were a lot of people in @entity7 and @entity47 that watched me play
i 've had a lot of messages
" @entity2 started the final round three shots clear of the chasing pack but his lead was gradually whittled away until he was briefly locked in a seven - way tie
but a vital birdie at the 16th saw him regain control
he then recorded par on the final hole by firing his second shot towards the spectators ' tent at the back of the green , taking a free drop and getting up and down in two for the win
his victory gives him a two year @entity8 exemption and a place at the 2011 masters at @entity70
" that was huge , " @entity2 said after his landmark victory
" i was really nervous over that [ last ] putt
my heart rate was probably 150
" @entity2 used to be a practice partner for world number one @entity77 but lost his @entity8 card last month after slipping too far down the money list when his minor medical exemption ran out
three years ago @entity2 was questioned over an incident in which the driver of a car who was allegedly trying to race him down an @entity86 street crashed and died
he was cleared of any wrongdoing after a year - long investigation
@entity2 has won on the @entity89 , @entity91 and @entity92 tours , but his first @entity8 victory was warmly greeted back in his home country
" i am delighted that @entity2 has this great victory on the @entity8 , " sports minister @entity95 said in a statement carried by @entity97
" it is truly a remarkable achievement and puts @entity7 golfers on an even higher level internationally
