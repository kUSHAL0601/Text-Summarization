-- comedy is hard ; dying is easy
any stand - up will tell you that
@entity5 and @entity6 play comedians in " @entity8
" let 's have a hand , then , for @entity11
@entity13 's most successful contemporary comedy producer is n't resting on his laurels but continues to push toward risky subject matter : male sexual insecurity in " the 40 - year - old @entity18 , " unwanted pregnancy in " @entity20 " -- and now the big @entity21 no , not cancer -- though @entity5 's superstar comedian @entity23 is stricken with an appropriately eccentric form of leukemia
no , this latest film 's true subject is celebrity and the funny things it does to people
@entity11 's most personal ( and also most self - indulgent ) film , " funny people , " shuffles between three competitive @entity35 roommates scrambling to grasp a rung on the showbiz ladder ( @entity6 , @entity38 , and @entity39 ) , @entity23 ' multimillion - dollar @entity41 mansion and the @entity35 comedy clubs that sometimes bridge the gap between anonymity and fame
@entity11 and @entity5 know these worlds well enough
the movie begins , in fact , with old home video footage of young @entity5 goofing off , making prank phone calls while his roommate @entity11 sniggers behind the camera
it 's one of the few times we see @entity5 really having fun and cutting loose
this is mostly a restrained , subdued and admirably unsentimental performance
it feels natural that @entity23 -- faced with his dire prognosis -- should return to the comedy circuit to wrestle with his imminent extinction before a roomful of strangers , even as he decides to keep his condition a secret from everyone around him
it 's actually not so hard in his case because he does n't have any real friends , only " showbiz friends
" the exception is @entity70 ( @entity6 ) , a struggling young comic who lucks into a job as his hero 's joke writer slash personal assistant
@entity23 is by turns demanding , generous , friendly and abusive , and @entity70 could n't be happier
the cross-currents are intriguing : he 's getting his first taste of the high life , just as @entity23 is trying to savor his last days by reliving his first steps on the circuit
true to form , @entity11 negotiates the perilous terrain of existential doubt with his fall - back weapon of choice , the penis joke
some of these are choice ( @entity70 's real last name is " @entity88 , " pronounced " @entity89 " ) , but many , many more feel flabby and redundant
there 's even an @entity92 joke , in the form of @entity92 himself -- one of several celebrity cameos , the oddest of which is surely @entity97 , wondering aloud if @entity23 would n't be better off dead
we must be approaching the 80 - minute mark by then , about the time many comedies start wrapping things up
but it 's a question that does n't seem to have occurred to @entity23 or the filmmakers before , and it spurs @entity11 on to develop another hour of additional material in which @entity23 , miraculously recovered , pursues the love of his life ( @entity108 ) , @entity70 in tow , without much consideration for her two daughters or her husband ( @entity113 )
it 's as if the movie bred its own sequel
there 's plenty of funny stuff here
@entity113 has a ball as the obtuse @entity121 , but despite all the blue jokes , this is a more modulated , pensive effort than @entity11 's previous hits
he 's improved , a little , as a director ( perhaps the credit belongs to cinematographer @entity126 , who ensures that for once it does n't all look like a sitcom ) , but @entity11 is still in dire need of a good editor
he wants to give us the six - course meal , and to go around the table , give everybody the chance to tell us a funny story
as a result " @entity8 " is consistently entertaining but also rather grueling -- as if we 're watching two or three different movies at the same time
at least one of these -- the tribulations of the young roomies -- we 've seen before , and amusing as these guys are , they properly belong in the deleted scenes category
but @entity11 is n't one to kill his babies , that 's for sure
he 's more likely to write them an additional scene or three
( @entity108 is mrs. @entity11 , and their two daughters also figure large
) still , if you 're not averse to too much of a good - ish thing , and can stomach another of those terminal @entity13 illnesses that leaves the patient with no discernible ill - effects , " @entity8 " is a fairly shrewd and nonjudgmental dissection of how celebrity skews and contaminates even the most intimate relationships
the rich and famous are n't the only narcissists in this game , it seems
we 're all a bit funny that way
" @entity8 " is rated r and runs 146 minutes
