to any parents who are anti-vaccine -- or perhaps better described as vaccine - hesitant -- let me say first that i can relate
when i had my first daughter nearly nine years ago , like probably a good number of new moms , i was irrationally worried about my child 's safety ( yes , i checked to make sure she was breathing every night ! )
i closely followed online discussions about most parenting decisions , so i was well aware of that now infamous report , which claimed to find a link between autism and what we call the @entity13 ( it stands for measles , mumps and rubella )
dr. @entity19 : vaccines are a matter of fact eight years ago , when it was time for my daughter to get her first @entity13 shot , i kind of freaked
i expressed my fears to my pediatrician , who is a big believer in homeopathic remedies , to give you a sense of how liberal she can be when it comes to modern medicine
what is your message to those who do n't vaccinate ? " it is totally safe
the science is sound , " she assured me
i remember her saying words to that effect , but my mom gut was n't totally convinced
to placate me , she said we could do the shots separately
instead of one vaccine , my daughter braved three different shots for measles , mumps and rubella
( she will have my head when she reads this ! ) a few years later , that report was officially discredited , debunked , you name it
when my younger daughter was scheduled for her first @entity13 shot , my worries were dramatically reduced -- so much so that i did n't insist that we separate the vaccine into three different shots
i had the doctor give her the whole shebang
while i struggled years earlier with the decision , i never truly considered not vaccinating my daughter
with a measles outbreak that is now getting national attention , i am convinced i made the right call
the unvaccinated , by the numbers but i 'm not an expert , just another parent looking to do what 's best for my child
so i reached out to a number of infectious disease experts , people who have no financial or political stake in the debate other than to ensure the safety of our children , to ask them one simple question : why should parents vaccinate their kids ? the diseases are still around @entity86 , associate professor of epidemiology at @entity88 , points out how the diseases we vaccinate against such as measles , while rare , still exist in the @entity91
" the diseases are much worse than any potential side effect from the vaccines , so for me it 's a risk - benefit , " said @entity86 , who has vaccinated her three children , ages 15 years old , 12 years old and 13 months
vaccines work , but some parents choose not to use them " i would much rather have my children get the vaccine than the disease itself
" people might not realize that measles is not just fever and rash , said dr. @entity107 , an infectious diseases and public health specialist
" @entity112 is also pneumonia , brain infection , it 's the leading cause of childhood blindness in the world , " said @entity107 , who added that some parents who do n't want to vaccinate want to avoid anything that 's not natural for their kids
" if you want to do something natural , vaccination is far more natural than if your child ends up on a ventilator or needing antibiotics or if they end up with a brain infection so if you are trying to balance what 's the most natural way to take care of your child , i would say measles vaccine is pretty high up there
" dr. @entity129 , director of the @entity130 at the @entity131 , told the story of a boy whose parents claimed their religion prohibited them from getting vaccines
at age 1 , the boy developed pneumonia and meningitis caused by a type of streptococcal bacteria that the vaccine protects against , so had he been vaccinated , he would not likely have gotten ill , according to @entity129
measles outbreak : different states , different rules on vaccinations the boy is currently alive but will never see , speak , walk or hear again , he said
" he will live in a vegetative state probably for five years until he dies from something else
basically , we snuffed out potentially a 75 - year - old perfectly normal life because of a false concern that vaccines would do harm , or in their misguided notion that somehow religion teaches us anything other than we should care for our children , " said @entity129 , author of " bad medicine : when @entity162 , " set to be released next month
other children are at risk a mother who is vaccine - anxious , though still vaccinating her children -- albeit on a very spread out time line -- told me she should have the right to do what she wants regarding her children
theoretically , if my children are vaccinated , then what she does or does not do with her kids should have no impact whatsoever on my child
but that 's totally incorrect , the experts say
when people do n't vaccinate their children , they increase the risk for people in the population who ca n't be vaccinated , such as infants under age 1 , children and adults with weak immune systems and people with cancer
" right now , what we 're seeing a resurgence of , besides measles , is whooping cough , which is especially deadly in infants who are too young to be vaccinated
so , you are not only putting your own children at risk but potentially putting others in the community at risk from that , " said @entity86 , who also leads an emerging infections laboratory at @entity88
@entity86 also says people who have been vaccinated are slightly at risk
" like anything in the world , there 's no 100 % guarantee , " said @entity86
for example , she said the measles vaccine is 99 % effective , which means one in 100 who receives two doses of the vaccine could still get the disease
@entity112 puts @entity217 on the spot @entity129 , who is also professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at the @entity131 , says while we have n't had a case of polio in the @entity91 since the 1970s , it still exists around the world
" so is it possible that people who are asymptomatically shedding polio virus walk into this country ? i think it happens all the time , " he said
" and if enough people choose not to vaccinate , then these diseases come back and that 's what we 're seeing
" @entity107 also cites the financial costs to the community if diseases like measles continue to spread
" we 're also all taxpayers and the amount of resources that are now being used in @entity243 per se as a result of the @entity246 outbreak , there 's a tremendous amount of resources to track down everybody who 's been in contact with those cases , " she said
" if you end up on a ventilator in intensive care because you have measles , if you have a brain infection that causes lifelong brain damage , that 's a burden on all of us
" saying ' you should vaccinate ' does n't work but the message that parents should vaccinate their children , a message that has been growing louder and louder in recent weeks , does n't necessarily seem to be working , all of the experts i spoke with said
telling parents what they should do may just have them dig their heels in deeper in their anti-vaccine approach to their children
what 's needed , said @entity129 , is more conversation parent to parent
it 's not doctors versus parents , he said , doctors are parents too
@entity129 , @entity277 show support for voluntary vaccines " what i do is basically say , ' when you love your child , you bring your child to us to care for your child
by saying you do n't want to get vaccines , you are asking me to practice substandard care , ' " said @entity129
' " ' you are asking me to send your child out into a world that is becoming progressively more dangerous
it 's an unloving thing to do
it 's a dangerous thing to do
please do n't put me in that position
' " @entity86 says she tries to tell her story as a scientist and as a parent
" i have three children , and they are all fully vaccinated , including a 13 - month - old at home ( who ) just recently got his mmr and his chicken pox vaccine , " she said
" i acknowledge as parents we all just want to do what 's best for our kids , there 's no doubting that , but what i feel is best is to follow the science
and i feel very secure in that science as a scientist
" more disease = more vaccinations sadly , what may get more people to get on board and start vaccinating their children is more disease itself
@entity129 recalled how his parents did n't need to be convinced to be vaccinated because when they were young , teens died of diptheria , whooping cough killed 8,000 people a year and people got paralysis from polio
" but for my children , who are 22 and 20 , they not only do n't see these ( diseases ) , they did n't grow up with these diseases , " said @entity129
" for all the talking we do , nothing talks louder than the virus itself or the disease
" " and that 's what you are seeing now , " said @entity129
people who have been on the fence about getting the measles vaccine themselves or getting the vaccine for their children are starting to get vaccinated because now they fear the disease , he said
" it 's too bad it has to come to that because it 's always the children who suffer our ignorance and that 's certainly the truth here
" do you think children should be vaccinated ? share your thoughts with @entity350 on @entity351 or @entity352 on @entity353 .
