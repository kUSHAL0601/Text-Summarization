-- we can spend the next few years beating ourselves up and debating the proposition that @entity3 saved @entity4 and @entity5 lost it
or we can get real and try to sort out what we can do now to protect @entity8 interests in a region that 's melting down
@entity4 was never the @entity8 's to win
that point -- along with lowered expectations and focused goals -- must be the basis of any new approach to the region
and here are three reasons
demography : there are two factors that nations -- even functional ones ( and @entity4 is not ) -- ca n't alter : what they are -- their demography ; and where they are -- their geography
@entity4 has been dealt an unhappy hand in both departments
there is , to be sure , a sense of @entity4 national identity
but at the same time the end of @entity36 's cruel rule -- for which the @entity8 is responsible -- opened up a @entity37 of sectarian tensions and expectations -- for which the @entity8 is partly responsible -- that have never been adequately addressed
in essence , the @entity8 overturned a brutal minority @entity43 rule and enabled @entity46 majority rule
the ins became the outs , and the outs the ins
and guess what ? despite several successful elections , $ 25 billion from the @entity8 to train and equip the @entity4 military , and another trillion in support of the @entity56 government , @entity4 never equitably distributed political and economic power
@entity43 became disenfranchised , angry and vulnerable to jihadi persuasions ; @entity46 sought to get even , get ahead and maintain a privileged position ; and @entity60 sought to protect their own interests and effectively create a separate governing authority
@entity4 these days is n't so much a nation as it is a collection of battling sectarian groups , each seeking advantage at the expense of the @entity4 state
geography : @entity4 's neighbors , particularly @entity71 and @entity72 , do not share @entity8 's vision of an equitably balanced and independent polity
each of them has its own vision
@entity4 has become a pawn in a regional competition between @entity43 and @entity46 and @entity80 and @entity81
@entity71 wants a weak , stable @entity4 not aligned with the @entity82 , under @entity46 influence
the @entity72 want @entity56 out and are happy that the militant group @entity85 in @entity4 and @entity86 may provide that opportunity , even as they fear the jihadists
they want @entity43 empowered and @entity71 disempowered
@entity90 has made its peace with the @entity4 @entity60 and hopes to get them to moderate the radical tendencies of those in @entity86 , but really has no answer to the @entity97 contagion
@entity98 is vulnerable to @entity97 too , but ca n't exercise much influence in @entity4
the regime of @entity102 is aligned with both @entity71 and @entity56 , and -- likely under @entity104 's encouragement -- has begun to use military force against @entity97 along the @entity86 - @entity4 border
all this regional maneuvering reflects the reality that the neighbors ' interests will continue to trump @entity8 's by virtue of their proximity , their influence in @entity4 , and the reality that @entity4 is more vital to them than it is to us
@entity86 : @entity4 ca n't be stabilized without dealing with @entity86
and to date , the @entity8 -- by default the only power that remotely has the capacity to alter the course of the civil war there -- has been unable and unwilling to do that
the @entity97 threat may prompt a review of the @entity5 administration 's @entity86 policy , but we should be under no illusions that @entity129 is ready to jump in with a comprehensive political , economic , and military strategy to end the conflict
indeed , the @entity8 will be faced with some tough choices
it may find itself in the odd position of ramping up support for the more moderate @entity43 rebels in @entity86 but also striking @entity97
that means we will be trying to weaken @entity102 on one hand , but indirectly strengthening him on the other by attacking a common enemy
under no circumstances should the @entity5 administration commit to trying to put two broken nations back together again
bottom line is that the real challenge is @entity97 , which is likely to remain ensconced in parts of @entity86 and @entity4
what should @entity5 do ? first let 's be clear about what he should n't do
the @entity8 needs to abandon any illusions that it can transform or find an easy way out of the situation
it is stuck in a region that it ca n't fix or leave
there is n't a single problem in this region that has a comprehensive or definitive solution
instead , the @entity8 should accept the reality that it will be dealing with outcomes , not happy endings , there
@entity4 may never be a unified polity , but it need not necessarily be a failed one
the question is , can we shape these outcomes to our advantage ? @entity3 tried to do too much ; @entity5 too little
is there a balance ? the @entity8 needs at least three different but related approaches : 1
sure , in the case of @entity71 , it 's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop
but the @entity8 ca n't begin to deal with @entity97 on its own
@entity71 is the key external power in @entity4
and @entity90 , @entity98 and @entity72 have a stake in stopping @entity97 's advances
the @entity8 may have to accept the reality that the evil @entity102 is a hedge against @entity97 , even though his policies helped to facilitate its rise
think diplomacy first , then military force
you need the first to make the second effective
that coordination must try to produce a more acceptable political arrangement in @entity193 , with or without @entity56
without the @entity4 government regaining @entity43 support , @entity97 will continue to roll
and this means some new and more inclusive political arrangement in @entity193 to share power
forget democracy and making @entity4 whole
to bring @entity43 around and check @entity97 , we may have to not only concede influence to @entity71 but also to some pretty bad @entity43 , including former @entity36 supporters and insurgents
the @entity8 will need to do what it can to buck up the @entity4 military
this could easily lead to sending additional advisers , but under no circumstances should it involve the use of combat forces
we may well have to use airstrikes and drones against @entity97
and this is tricky , because it risks feeding jihadi sentiment
that 's why a new political arrangement is mandatory
but even without it , the @entity8 must face the reality that @entity97 -- with money , passports , and a base of operations -- will emerge as a threat to our friends in the region , to @entity229 and ultimately to us
we should n't run scared
@entity97 's own ideology will produce a counterreaction among @entity4 who will oppose its harsh , unforgiving ideology
indeed as the @entity234 points out , @entity97 is its own worst enemy
the region is littered with the remains of failed jihadi efforts , including @entity240 central
in 2013 , there were 17,800 global fatalities as a result of terrorist attacks
only 16 of those were @entity8
@entity246 is not a strategic threat to the homeland right now
but it may well require a coordinated counterterror effort with our regional and international partners to prevent it from becoming one .
