-- @entity1 have rejected out of hand a formal offer from @entity4 for their talismanic captain @entity5 , the @entity7 club confirmed on wednesday
the @entity9 champions officially launched their bid to re-sign the 23 - year - old earlier in the day when director general @entity12 told reporters an offer had been made
fabregas came through the youth ranks at the @entity17 before joining @entity1 in 2003 , and declared last month he would like to return to @entity19
the midfielder then backtracked by saying that he would put his future in the hands of @entity1 manager @entity23 and instead focus on playing for @entity19 at the @entity24 in @entity25
but @entity1 met @entity4 's offer with a curt response
a statement on their official web site read : " @entity1 captain @entity5 is under contract with the club until the summer of 2015
he is a highly valued member of the team and part of our future plans
" we have followed recent speculation linking @entity5 with a move away from the @entity42 but as there has never been any official approach for him , only two informal exchanges , in which we made it abundantly clear that we have no interest in transferring @entity5 , we have refrained from publicly passing comment
" however , yesterday evening we received an offer from @entity4 for @entity5 and in response , we immediately and resolutely told them once again that we have no intention of selling our captain
" to be clear , we will not make any kind of counterproposal or enter into any discussion
@entity4 have publicly stated that they will respect our position and we expect that they will keep their word
" @entity55 had earlier told reporters during a presentation of the club 's latest sponsorship deal : " everybody knows that @entity5 wants to sign for @entity4 and that we also want him to come here , but there is also a third party involved -- @entity1
" any agreement has to be with them
the official window for transfer negotiations opened on june 1 , and although we 'd had unofficial conversations with them before yesterday , we 've now made a formal written offer , which we presented to @entity1 yesterday afternoon
" @entity4 vice-president @entity70 said that director of football @entity71 and director @entity73 were leading the negotiations
" i 'm optimistic that he 'll be able to sign for @entity4 as soon as possible , and it 's clear that everybody here will give him a warm welcome , " @entity70 said in quotes on the @entity4 web site
" we 'll do nothing that might make it more difficult for him to come here , and we wo n't rush things -- but we wo n't stop either ! " meanwhile , @entity70 also played down reports that last summer 's marquee signing @entity88 would be leaving @entity4 after a disappointing first season in @entity19
the recent signing of @entity19 striker @entity91 from @entity92 for $ 49 million has put the @entity95 international 's @entity17 future under some scrutiny
" there is no problem with @entity88
he 's happy and i hope he 'll be here scoring goals as he did last season for many years to come
there 's nothing to say other than that we are very satisfied with him , " @entity70 said .
