@entity0 -- a top @entity3 official said saturday that authorities believe those responsible for a pair of deadly car bombings earlier in the day had been in contact with the @entity10 government 's secret police force
in a news conference , deputy prime minister @entity11 said the @entity10 government was linked to the attack
" the investigation into the perpetrators is for the most part complete
it has been determined that the organization and its members who carried out the attack were in contact with @entity27 regime @entity25 ( @entity28 ) organization in @entity10 , " he said
" the organization is identified and for the most part the persons involved are identified
" @entity11 added that license plate checks have been " completed " and " the organization and its members ( behind the attacks ) have been largely identified
" but @entity10 's information minister denied that his country had any involvement in the bomb attacks
@entity40 made the comments sunday while speaking to journalists in @entity43 on @entity44
" we were saddened yesterday for the fall of martyrs in @entity3 , " @entity40 said
" in one way or another ; @entity3 people are the @entity10 brothers
" the two car bombs exploded saturday afternoon in the southern @entity3 town of @entity52 , according to @entity3 interior minister @entity53
in addition to the 43 people dead , 29 people were injured critically , said @entity57
@entity11 added that 50 people were still hospitalized as of saturday night
the first blast occurred at about 1:55 p.m. at the municipality building , which houses city government offices
a second , more powerful blast occurred in front of the post office
in both cases , cars were loaded with large amounts of explosive material , according to @entity57
there was a third explosion of a diesel fuel tank elsewhere in @entity52 , but @entity57 said this was ruled an accident
@entity74 was just outside of the town when he heard the blasts and hurried to the scene of one of them , where he saw " body parts everywhere
" " buildings and the walls of buildings are collapsed , " @entity74 said
" the windows , the cars , everything is burned around it , people are burned
the scene is outrageous , may @entity91 grant us peace
" a video posted on @entity95 showed a column of thick , black smoke rising from the center of town ; another video showed what appeared to be where one of the bombs erupted
rescuers were pulling bloodied people from the street , the side of a building had been torn off and the windows of the building across the rubble - crusted street had been blown out
@entity1 is not able to confirm the videos ' authenticity
the blast drew swift condemnation internationally , including from @entity117 secretary of state @entity116 , who vowed that @entity120 will " stand with our ally , @entity3
" the report came shortly after the @entity122 for @entity10 , an opposition group , reported that @entity10 government forces had fired several shells toward @entity52 , which is in @entity3 's southern province of @entity127
several @entity10 were among the casualties , according to the @entity129 , another opposition group
but that did not spare @entity10 residents of the town from being blamed by residents
" people with sticks in their hands are going after @entity10 , " @entity74 said
" we almost have more @entity10 here than @entity3 , and people are getting angry
" the town 's location in @entity127 along the southern border with @entity10 " carries sensitivity , " prime minister @entity139 told reporters here , according to @entity141
" around ( 20,000 ) to 25,000 @entity10 live here in camps as our guests
certain steps as in @entity52 today may be taken to affect the sensitivity in @entity127 by those not willing to accept the status quo
" @entity3 hosts more than 190,000 @entity10 refugees in state - run camps , and more @entity10 who have fled their country to @entity3 cities and towns
in addition , @entity3 has played a major role in providing assistance and a relatively safe springboard for operations to @entity10 opposition groups
the timing of the blasts comes as momentum toward a resolution of the @entity10 issue has grown , said foreign minister @entity168 , @entity141 reported
" such blasts taking place on saturday were no coincidence , " he told reporters in @entity170 , where he was on an official trip
" the tranquility and stability of the @entity3 and our citizens have priority more than anything else , " he said
" it is possible that certain sides may want to sabotage @entity3 's tranquility
no power would be successful in hurting @entity3 's tranquility
" in a statement , the opposition @entity185 condemned the attacks
" the @entity185 sees these heinous terrorist acts as an attempt to take revenge on the @entity3 people and punish them for their honorable support for the @entity10 people , including their welcoming of @entity10 refugees who have fled the regime 's crimes in their villages and cities , " it said
" the @entity185 views this attack as a desperate and failed attempt to sow discord between the two peoples
" the conflict in @entity10 has repeatedly spilled across borders to @entity3 , prompting @entity3 security forces to reinforce the frontier
at @entity3 's request , the @entity209 military alliance deployed several @entity212 missile batteries to protect @entity3 border cities from the threat of @entity10 missile attacks
