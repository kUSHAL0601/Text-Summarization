@entity0 , @entity1 -- a bomber who apparently killed himself in central @entity0 on saturday was probably on his way to a more crowded location , but his bomb went off prematurely , @entity1 authorities said monday

the warning came from a man called @entity19 , the news agency that got the e-mail told @entity2 monday

a car exploded shortly before @entity26 's bomb , injuring two people ; police are also linking that blast to him
no one other than @entity26 was killed
the @entity30 said the incidents appeared to be the work of " a single perpetrator
" he appears to have been acting alone at the time of the explosion , @entity8 said monday
police believe that he had some kind of outside help in preparing the explosives , but they have no additional suspects at the moment , @entity8 said
on sunday , @entity41 of the @entity30 called the explosions " an act of terrorism
" but he said monday that there was no reason for the public to be worried and that @entity1 was not raising its terror threat level

" they are experts at tracing explosives , and they have knowledge of what explosives that have been used at other attacks in the world
" @entity75 spokesman @entity74 said " a small team of experts " was sent after @entity1 authorities requested @entity61 assistance in investigating the bombings
prime minister @entity79 called the explosions " completely unacceptable " as he mounted an impassioned defense of @entity1 society in the face of what seems to be its first suicide bombing
" this is not the path we want to go down , " he said sunday
" @entity1 is an open society , " @entity79 added
" it is an open society which has demonstrated a will that people must be able to come from different backgrounds , believe in different gods or not believe in any god at all

" they expressed their mutual involvement in the fight against terrorism , and they also stressed that the two countries ' authorities will continue to cooperate closely in this investigation
" regional police chief @entity115 said the bomber had " failed
" " while this was a very serious event , no innocent people were seriously hurt
if that was the intention , then the perpetrator failed , " she said

the spokesman , who would not give his name , said that the warrant was executed under @entity102 's @entity132 and that " no arrests have been made ... and no hazardous substances have been found
" the writer of the e-mailed threats to the @entity1 news agency and police mentioned the presence of @entity1 troops in @entity141 and a @entity1 cartoonist who depicted the prophet @entity143 , according to @entity54 , a @entity1 news wire that received the threats
the e-mails contained sound files featuring a person speaking in @entity1 and @entity149 , @entity54 reported
about 500 @entity1 troops are in @entity141 , according to @entity152 's @entity151
the sender referred to @entity1 silence regarding the @entity141 troops and the controversial cartoon by @entity157 that depicted @entity143 as having the body of a dog
" now your children , daughters and sisters will die like our brothers and sisters and children are dying , " the e-mail states , according to @entity54
" our actions will speak for themselves , " the person said in an audio recording
" as long as you do n't end your war against @entity174 and the humiliation against the prophet and with your stupid support to @entity157 the pig
" @entity41 said over the weekend that authorities are working on both intelligence and a normal police investigation and will try to determine " if there may be any more acts of terrorism like this one being planned
at this point , we do n't think there are more acts coming , but we ca n't say for sure
" @entity188 , chairman of the @entity189 , a mosque north of @entity125 , said he had a " series of confrontations " with @entity26 during the month of @entity191 in either 2006 or 2007
he said @entity26 was propagating an extremist message around the mosque , " sowing the seeds of violent radicalization " by preaching violent jihad as an obligation for every @entity200
@entity188 said @entity26 also accused other @entity200 leaders of apostasy , denouncing them as untrustworthy and claimed they were working for the government
the two men parted ways after a final confrontation , and @entity26 did not return to the mosque , @entity188 said
@entity2 's @entity208 contributed to this report .
