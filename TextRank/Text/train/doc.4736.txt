-- as @entity2 continues to celebrate @entity5 's @entity4 title , things are n't going quite as well for @entity6
@entity6 , who owns a men 's record 17 grand slam titles , slumped to his lowest world ranking in 10 years when the new standings were released monday
the @entity11 dropped from third to fifth in the aftermath of his upset loss in the second round to @entity15 at @entity4 , matching the ranking he last held in june 2003 when he was n't yet a grand slam winner
@entity6 , a month away from his 32nd birthday , responded to the defeat by entering a pair of smaller clay court tournaments in @entity23 in a bid to reverse fortunes
he is sixth in the calendar - year points standings , with the top eight earning a berth at the year - end championships in @entity30
@entity6 will play at next week 's @entity31 in @entity32 before contesting the @entity33 in @entity34 the following week
" i 'm really looking forward to playing in front of my home fans in @entity34 this summer , " @entity6 told his website this month
" i have got a lot of great memories of the tournament in the mountains of @entity11
" @entity6 last played in @entity34 in 2004 , winning the event for the only time
he lost his first four matches there before reaching the final in 2003 a week after his maiden grand slam triumph at @entity4
while @entity6 frets over his drop in the rankings , man of the moment @entity5 is very much on the up
he has spectacularly recovered -- with the help of coach @entity54 -- from losing his first four grand slam finals and in the 2011 semifinals at @entity4 to @entity57 when he was firmly in control
he has now captured two of the last three grand slam tournaments he has competed in and replaced @entity6 as the world 's best grass court player , having also claimed @entity64 gold at @entity4 in 2012 and a @entity4 warm - up in @entity30 last month
" under pressure right now @entity5 has two majors and a gold medal , " his coach @entity54 told @entity2 newspaper the @entity68 as he reflected on @entity5 's @entity4 victory over @entity70 on sunday
" @entity70 is a great player , do n't get me wrong
he has had a phenomenal last 12 months , basically since the start of 2011 , so the rankings look at all of that
" [ but ] if somebody has two majors and an @entity79 , and everybody else has only one major
" @entity54 added , before tailing off
" everybody can make their own opinion on that
" when the @entity86 downed world @entity87 in straight sets in sunday 's final , it ended a 77 - year wait for a @entity2 men 's singles champion at tennis ' most prestigious tournament
@entity5 said monday that he only had one - hour of sleep after his victory -- and that he did n't want to go to sleep at all because he thought when he woke up it would all be a dream
the @entity97 was one of those to congratulate @entity5 and he is being tipped to receive knighthood
the @entity86 's last loss on grass was to @entity6 in the 2012 @entity4 final
" i did n't always think it was going to happen , " said @entity5 of his @entity4 conquest
" i did n't doubt myself so much after last year 's final
" it was the best i 'd recovered from a grand slam loss
maybe a couple of years ago when i lost in the semis to @entity57 when i was up a set , maybe a break as well or had break points , and did n't get that , that was a tough , tough one for me
" and @entity5 said he does n't expect his motivation to dip after his historic fortnight at @entity4
" i hope i do n't lose hunger -- i think i should be able to use this as motivation , " said the @entity86
" i know what it 's like losing in a @entity4 final , and i know what it 's like winning one
and it 's a lot better winning
" i just need to make sure i do n't get side - tracked by anything
