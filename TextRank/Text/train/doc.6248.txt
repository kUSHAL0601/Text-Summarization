-- @entity1 ca n't reach his hotel in @entity3 because there 's a police barricade in front of it
a manager promises to " help " him cancel the reservation , but three days later , his credit card is charged $ 113
now his credit card has sided with the hotel
is there anything else he can do ? q : i do n't know where else to turn
i recently booked a room at the @entity19 in @entity3 through its central reservations phone number
when i arrived , the @entity21 had the entire block closed off
i immediately called the hotel and told a manager i could n't access the hotel
he said he did not know when the blockade would be lifted and could n't help get my car or luggage to the hotel
he could n't cancel my reservation because i had made it through @entity34 's central reservations number
after several more attempts to reach the hotel , he agreed to help me cancel my reservation
i stayed at another hotel that night
three days later , a $ 113 charge appeared on my credit card from the @entity34
i disputed the charge , but they told me i could n't get a refund because i could not prove that they refused me the room
when i called guest relations they said they needed a cancellation number before they would consider a refund
otherwise the hotel itself would need to reverse the charge
when i call the hotel , i get only voicemail
can you help ? -- @entity1 , @entity57 , @entity58 a : if a hotel representative says your reservation is canceled , you should n't be charged for your stay
but a review of your correspondence raises a few red flags
first , a manager told you that it was impossible for him to cancel a reservation made through @entity34 's 800 - number
then , a few minutes later , the same manager agrees to " help " you cancel the reservation
i would assume that " helping " you means your reservation is officially canceled , but what if he just looked into it and then decided it could n't be done , and left your original reservation intact ? since @entity34 did n't have a cancellation number , it probably means there was no cancellation
here 's what you did right : you noted the name of the manager with whom you spoke
you followed up with @entity34 , and you were persistent but polite
here 's what you overlooked : you should have called the central reservations number and asked for a cancellation number
if they refused to give you a number , you should have given a representative the name of the manager you spoke with
i would have followed up with the manager and not let @entity34 off the hook until you had a number
but getting a number is n't enough
instead of continuing to call @entity34 , i would have sent it a short , cordial email asking for a verification of your cancellation in writing
if you send an email through a hotel company 's web site ( @entity34 ) you 'll typically receive a meaningful answer in a matter of days , if not hours
with that information , your credit card dispute would have probably been a slam - dunk
before getting to the resolution on your case , let me add one more thing
as far as i can tell , @entity34 was under no obligation to refund your money
you could n't reach the hotel because of a police barricade , which the property could n't control
but since a manager assured you that he would help you make a cancellation , i think it 's reasonable to expect a refund
i contacted @entity34 on your behalf
it reviewed your case and apologized for the way in which your refund was handled
" clearly the inability to access the hotel was beyond your control , and in as such , you should be relieved of the $ 113 charge you have received , " a representative wrote to you in a letter
you 're getting your $ 113 back
