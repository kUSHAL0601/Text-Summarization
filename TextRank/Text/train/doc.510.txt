-- @entity1 had been acting strangely for almost a month
weeks of pounding , wall - to - wall headaches had left the normally calm and confident 35 - year - old mother of three feeling confused , anxious , and doubting
" she could n't function , " recalls @entity6 , @entity1 's husband
" she could n't do anything , and she had these really intense levels of paranoia
" over-the - counter medications did nothing to relieve her headaches , and visits to the doctor and a local emergency room were similarly fruitless
@entity1 's state of mind continued to deteriorate
the breaking point finally came on a december night in 2008 , when she stood in the middle of the kitchen floor and screeched at the top of her lungs
" it was a bloodcurdling scream , " @entity6 recalls
later that night , @entity6 found his wife slumped on the concrete floor of the garage , moaning
that chilling evening marked the beginning of a medical odyssey that would ultimately involve four hospitals , experts in three states , and 10 months of guessing , testing , doubting , and hoping
something was attacking @entity1 's brain
she 'd spend five months in a drug - induced coma before doctors knew what it was
@entity0 : your life - saving guide to bad headaches buying time an ambulance rushed @entity1 to the @entity44 after she collapsed , but she was quickly transferred to the intensive - care unit ( @entity46 ) at nearby @entity47 , in @entity48 , @entity49
neurologist @entity50 , @entity51 , was there when she arrived
" she was psychotic and required restraints , both physical and emotional , " @entity50 says , referring to tranquilizers
" she was trying to hurt herself and the people around her
after hearing her symptoms , he at first suspected encephalitis , a swelling of the brain usually related to an infection
he tested @entity1 for more than a hundred viruses and bacteria that can cause the condition , but everything came back negative
in no state to return home , @entity1 was admitted to the hospital for tests and observation
two weeks later , @entity50 and his team had a breakthrough when an electroencephalogram , or @entity74 , revealed recurring seizures in @entity1 's brain that were unaccompanied by physical symptoms -- a serious condition , known as nonconvulsive status epilepticus , that kills 56 percent of the people it affects
but their relief at having finally arrived at a diagnosis was short - lived ; the seizures failed to respond as expected to a slew of drugs
@entity0 : 20 medical mysteries and miracles shortly thereafter , @entity6 walked into the hospital to visit his wife and found her bed empty
unbeknownst to him , doctors had used a powerful anesthetic to put @entity1 in a coma and had transferred her to an icu on another floor
" the doctors explained to me that if they continued to let her brain seize like that , it would eventually wear out and start shutting down , " @entity6 says
" they induced the coma
that was the only way they could buy more time to seek and find out what was wrong
" as @entity6 remembers it , the scene that greeted him when he saw @entity1 in a coma for the first time was like something out of " @entity44 " or " @entity111 , " not real life
" it was kind of freaky , " he says
" you do n't expect to see that with a loved one
everything just comes slamming right at you
it 's very overwhelming to walk in and witness it alone
" @entity0 : tv doctors bring unethical behavior to prime time an elusive tumor by mid-january , @entity1 's condition had n't improved , and she was transferred to a larger facility in @entity48
the doctors at @entity128 decided to take a more aggressive approach , deepening her coma with the drug pentobarbital
but after six weeks @entity1 was even worse
her blood pressure had plummeted and she had developed hypothermia -- common complications of lying in the @entity46 for so long
" i still have the image of walking into the room and seeing despair on the nurses ' faces , " says @entity6 , who visited @entity1 on all but four days during the ordeal
" i got terrified that maybe we were taking a turn for the worse
" in reality , the doctors were getting warmer
they began to speculate that an antibody produced by @entity1 's own immune system -- a protein that usually fights disease -- was damaging her brain
to confirm their hunch , they sent samples of @entity1 's cerebrospinal fluid ( @entity154 ) to the @entity155 , in @entity48 , @entity156
the test results provided a glimmer of hope : pathologists had found an antibody -- they just did n't know what it was
@entity0 : ' indescribable , crazy pain ' : i survived dengue fever experts at the @entity168 eventually identified the mysterious antibody as a type that targets receptors in the central nervous system that are involved in memory and neuron function
( the antibody can also attack nerve cells in the brain , which would explain @entity1 's seizures
) these so - called anti-nmda receptor antibodies usually arise in response to a type of tumor called a teratoma
teratomas tend to appear in ovaries and testes and can contain cells and tissues of all kinds , even embryonic body parts such as hair and teeth
once again , the doctors ' optimism waned quickly as they struggled to locate the tumor
meanwhile , chemotherapy had no apparent effect
even though they could n't find a tumor , the doctors decided that the only remaining option to save @entity1 's life was to remove her ovaries and hope for the best
a few days after @entity1 underwent surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes , @entity6 got a call on his cell phone from one of @entity1 's doctors
" we found a tumor , " she told him , sounding choked up
it was indeed a teratoma , a benign but messy jumble of hair cells , nerve tissue , and teeth
the antibodies created by @entity1 's body to fight the nerve tissue in the teratoma were inadvertently attacking healthy tissue in her brain
with that , @entity1 became one of about 100 people in the world to be diagnosed with @entity227 receptor encephalitis
in many ways her case is typical
the vast majority of patients who develop this rare condition are women , and most experience psychiatric symptoms , memory problems , and seizures
ovarian teratomas are the culprit in most cases , but not all
but no one has experienced seizures for as long as @entity1 did and survived , according to @entity50
a slow recovery once the tumor was removed , @entity1 's doctors started the slow , painstaking process of tapering off the drugs and bringing her out of her five - month coma
on @entity249 2009 , @entity1 awoke briefly and smiled when she heard the nurses in her room mention @entity253 fries
" @entity1 , do you like @entity253 fries ? " they asked her
she mouthed the word " yes
" @entity1 took about four weeks to become fully alert and conversant
her first memory upon waking , she says , was hearing that @entity260 was dead
( ironically , @entity260 suffered cardiac arrest after overdosing on propofol , the drug that @entity1 's doctors used to induce her coma
) it was june 2009 , and she remembered nothing since october of the previous year
@entity0 : @entity260 's death : why cardiac arrest is deadlier than heart attack the seizures have stopped , but @entity1 , now 36 , is still struggling with the aftereffects of the coma
now , more than a year after waking up , she is at home but in a wheelchair , suffering from nerve damage and muscle spasms
she had hoped that she would be walking by now
" i like to believe it 's temporary , " she says
three - quarters of the people who have contracted anti-nmda receptor encephalitis have recovered fully or with minor neurological problems
@entity50 , who took care of @entity1 for the duration of her illness , is grateful that she seems well on her way to joining that group
" this was a very unusual outcome , especially for someone with seizures that long , " he says
