@entity0 -- a war of words continued tuesday over the possible contempt of @entity6 vote against attorney general @entity7 later this week , with the @entity8 citing past examples of presidents claiming executive privilege in similar disputes over documents
the @entity8 response followed a letter monday night from @entity17 chairman @entity16 , @entity18 , that slammed president @entity20 's assertion of executive privilege in the panel 's probe of the botched @entity24 gun running sting
with the @entity8 scheduled to vote thursday on the contempt measure against @entity7 , the @entity8 fired back against @entity16 with a list of past cases in which presidents asserted executive privilege for the same kinds of documents sought by @entity16 's committee
@entity8 spokesman @entity32 told reporters tuesday that @entity8 @entity34 have made the dispute a political issue , while another spokesman , @entity37 , ridiculed @entity16 's analysis of the executive privilege claim by @entity20
@entity16 's panel has been seeking documents that show why the @entity42 decided to withdraw as inaccurate a february 2011 letter sent to @entity6 that said top officials had only recently learned about the @entity24 operation
however , @entity7 has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations , and asked @entity20 to assert executive privilege over such documents last week
in his letter monday , @entity16 said @entity20 's assertion of executive privilege means that he and his most senior advisers were involved in " managing " @entity24 and the " fallout from it " or that the president asserted a power he knows is unjustified " for the purpose of further obstructing a congressional investigation
" " to date , the @entity8 has steadfastly maintained that it has not had any role in advising the @entity59 with respect to the congressional investigation
the surprising assertion of executive privilege raised the question of whether that is still the case , " @entity16 said in his letter
@entity67 responded that @entity16 's account " has as much merit as his absurd contention that @entity24 was created in order to promote gun control
" " our position is consistent with executive branch legal precedent for the past three decades spanning administrations of both parties , and dating back to president @entity79 's @entity42 , " @entity67 said
" the courts have routinely considered deliberative process privilege claims and affirmed the right of the executive branch to invoke the privilege even when @entity8 documents are not involved
" a supporting document provided by @entity67 listed five such cases , including an october 1981 assertion by @entity79 involving documents describing internal deliberations inside the @entity91 and another by @entity79 a year later involving internal @entity93 files
republicans on @entity16 's committee approved the contempt measure against @entity7 for refusing to hand over all of the requested documents in the panel 's investigation of the operation run by the @entity101
the vote last week came after @entity20 asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel
the @entity8 move means the @entity42 can withhold some of the documents
opinion : do n't be nosy about @entity24 the @entity101 launched @entity24 out of @entity109 to track weapons purchases by @entity112 drug cartels
however , it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border , and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of @entity123 agent @entity24
if the @entity8 passes the contempt measure thursday , it would be the first time in history a sitting @entity129 attorney general was cited for contempt of @entity6
" i urge you to reconsider the decision to withhold documents that would allow @entity6 to complete its investigation , " @entity16 said in his letter
" i remain hopeful that the attorney general will produce the specified documents so that we can work towards resolving this matter short of a contempt citation
" by the numbers : @entity24 the showdown between @entity16 and @entity7 over the @entity24 program dates back to subpoenas issued by the @entity145 last year
@entity16 and @entity34 contend that @entity7 and the @entity42 are concealing details of how @entity24 was approved and managed
@entity147 argue that @entity16 and his @entity34 colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting @entity7 and , by extension , the president in an election year
a video released tuesday by @entity147 on @entity16 's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of @entity8 links to @entity24 , juxtaposed with @entity16 saying sunday there was no evidence of a @entity8 cover - up
read the report , " the video says in conclusion
@entity167 @entity166 , @entity168 , alleged last week that @entity34 were targeting @entity7 because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in november
@entity16 , however , said in his letter that the assertion of executive privilege " raises more questions than it answers
" the letter provided details of a june 19 meeting between @entity16 and @entity7 on the eve of the committee 's partisan vote on the contempt measure
@entity16 said @entity7 wanted to " buy peace " on the matter
" he indicated a willingness to produce the ' fair compilation ' of post-february 4th documents
he told me that he would provide the ' fair compilation ' of documents on three conditions : ( 1 ) that i permanently cancel the contempt vote ; ( 2 ) that i agree the department was in full compliance with the committee 's subpoenas , and ; ( 3 ) that i accept the ' fair compilation , ' sight unseen , " @entity16 said in the letter , calling @entity7 's conditions " unacceptable
" " the attorney general 's conditional offer of a ' fair compilation ' of a subset of documents covered by the subpoena , and your assertion of executive privilege , in no way substitute for the fact that the @entity42 is still grossly deficient in its compliance with the committee 's subpoena , " @entity16 's letter said
" by the department 's own admission , it has withheld more than 130,000 pages of responsive documents
" @entity16 also stressed the importance of forging a settlement rather than pursuing contempt of @entity6 proceedings , and asked the @entity8 for answers to questions about the executive privilege assertion
" to what extent were you or your most senior advisers involved in @entity24 and the fallout from it , including the false february 4 , 2011 letter provided by the attorney general to the committee ? " @entity16 's letter said
" please also identify any communications , meetings , and teleconferences between the @entity8 and the @entity42 between february 4 , 2011 and june 18 , 2012 , the day before the attorney general requested that you assert executive privilege
" @entity24 investigation started with agent 's death
