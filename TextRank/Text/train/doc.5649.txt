@entity0 , @entity1 -- with a natural disaster playing out in slow motion as lava from @entity7 on @entity1 's @entity1 inches towards homes and businesses in @entity0 , officials are preparing to begin evacuations
the 2,000 - degree river of molten rock is advancing on up to 12 homes and businesses , @entity11 , director of the @entity12 , told reporters on tuesday
" the last couple of days we 've been going door - to - door , working with residents in the area , preparing them for an evacuation , and it 's likely tonight we will begin some of those evacuations based on the conditions we are seeing , " he said
" for the most part , the residents have been preparing for this
" the evacuations , if they occur , would be among the first to take place since the slow - moving lava flow began moving towards @entity0 in june , when a volcanic crater vented and released the river of liquid rock
" our goal is to work with the residents and business owners , as the lava flow goes through their area , " @entity11 said
" there will be an opportunity for them to stay on site as long as it 's safe to do so
" @entity46 chest high in some places the dark ooze has swallowed up fences , flowed over a cemetery and neared major roads
on tuesday morning , it set a wooden garden shed ablaze
in some places in this community of about 950 residents , the lava is chest high
" everybody , including myself , is quite nervous , " @entity59 told @entity2 affiliate @entity60
" we do n't know
we ca n't see the future
the flow does what the flow does
" by tuesday morning , the lava was about 200 yards from the closest home and moving in a northeast direction
it was flowing 10 yards per hour , @entity72 of @entity73 said
@entity1 officials have n't issued a mandatory evacuation yet
but many residents in the community have already chosen to leave on their own
" most people have vacated , " @entity1 civil defense worker @entity79 told @entity2 affiliate @entity80
" they have moved out of their homes
there 's only a few people left
" @entity87 has started packing his things , including his parents ' memorabilia , @entity2 affiliate @entity86 reported
his mom and dad lost their dream @entity93 home to lava flow in 1991 , and @entity87 never thought he 'd see his home meet the same fate , he told the station
he hopes to watch the lava pass through , if it does
" to see it , in actuality , i think it might bring closure to know that it 's done and turn that page , and we 're starting another chapter , " @entity87 told @entity86
@entity72 said authorities were n't going to try to divert the flow
" no matter how you would turn it , you would direct it toward someone 's property , " he said
there are about 40 to 50 homes in the first group of residences that are being threatened
taking precautions the lava flow is expected to displace 900 schoolchildren in the area
residents who do n't expect their homes to be destroyed worry about being cut off
" a lot of us are loading up on gas , getting generators in case the energy goes out , " @entity124 told @entity2
" and we 're checking to make sure the @entity131 stays up
" the @entity73 has rebuilt two gravel roads to give residents escape routes from the lava flow
power company crews are installing 70 - foot - tall poles with heat resistant protection to raise cables higher off the roads
@entity141 , a spokeswoman for the @entity142 , said there were no outages due to the lava flow
" if for some reason someone ca n't get to our clinic , we will be there with the mobile unit , " said @entity146 , ceo of @entity147
" there 's going to be people who need prescriptions and more
" smoke a problem the smoke is a problem for residents , especially those with respiratory conditions
" it 's burning through thick brush , fern , " @entity162 , a @entity163 geologist , told @entity2 affiliate @entity86
" a lot of smoke ( is ) coming off the front , a lot of cracking noises , methane explosions are going on
so it 's a noisy situation out there just from all the burning vegetation
" some evacuated homes are being targeted by looters , a business owner said
" crime is starting to pick up because a lot of people abandoned their houses
two of my brother - in - laws ' houses got ripped off , " said @entity182 , owner of the @entity183 , on monday
but the @entity73 said it has received no reports of looting at evacuated houses or businesses
' not going to happen ' @entity190 , the @entity1 mayor , said residents must work together
" as it gets closer , the key is communication with the community , keeping people informed and everybody continue to work around the clock really hard just to minimize as much as possible the impact on the people of @entity0 , " he told @entity86
but many residents are rolling with the punches
the lava flow is not exactly a surprise , since it started june 27 and has advanced about 13 miles since then
@entity7 is one of the world 's most active volcanoes
" i think it 's going to be a little intense at first , a little crazy , " resident @entity207 told @entity60
" i think people will adjust
everybody knows what 's happening
" @entity59 said people must plan to rebuild
" everybody would wish this lava flow to stop , " he told @entity60 , " but it 's not going to happen , " @entity2 's @entity213 reported from @entity0 , @entity214 from @entity215 and @entity216 from @entity217
@entity2 's @entity218 and @entity219 also contributed to this report .
