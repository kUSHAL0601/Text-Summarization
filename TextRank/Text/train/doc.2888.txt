@entity0 -- authorities have identified the @entity6 user accused of posting violent threats against the @entity8 , @entity3 comissioner @entity2 said wednesday
@entity2 said the user is not located in @entity0 , but police were preparing to interview the person
@entity2 declined to offer details on the person 's exact whereabouts , but did say reckless endangerment is one of the possible charges the alleged tweeter could face
@entity6 initially had refused to disclose the user 's personal information to police investigating the threats , but identified the individual after being served with a subpoena
" we think in an instance like this , sort of common sense would dictate that we get that sort of information , " @entity2 said
" certainly this message referred to ( the mass shooting in ) @entity33
referred to a specific location
this is the type of thing that a law enforcement agency needs to know
" @entity6 has not responded to multiple @entity1 requests for comment
deputy police commissioner @entity40 told @entity1 tuesday , " we take the threat seriously , especially in light of recent attacks in @entity45 and @entity46
" authorities said the @entity6 user posted a threat about an attack at the @entity8 in @entity51 , where former boxing champion @entity52 , 46 , is performing his one - man show , " @entity52 : @entity54 , " a @entity56 production that centers on his well - publicized life
additional information about the incident was not disclosed , but authorities have bolstered security at the theater and other public areas across @entity0 after two deadly mass shootings in @entity46 and @entity45
authorities ' quest this week for personal user information highlights a growing conundrum for companies in the internet age , when privacy concerns are pitted against those of public safety .
