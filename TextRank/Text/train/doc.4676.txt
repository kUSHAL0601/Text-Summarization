@entity0 -- a former @entity4 station chief in @entity5 is under investigation by the @entity8 and justice departments after being accused of raping at least two women while he held the post , a source confirmed to @entity1 on wednesday
two @entity5 women allege that the @entity4 's former @entity5 station chief raped them at his home , a source says
the women told investigators that they think date - rape drugs were used in the assaults , which are said to have occurred at the officer 's official residence , according to the source
the story was first reported by @entity23
the allegations were made in the fall , when the unidentified officer was still serving as station chief
in october , soon after the allegations were made , the man returned to the @entity31 for a previously scheduled trip and was ordered not to return to his post , the source said
a senior @entity31 official confirmed that the case is under investigation but refused to comment on the details
@entity39 spokesman @entity38 issued a brief statement in response to a @entity1 inquiry , saying that " the individual in question has returned to @entity0 and the @entity31 government is looking into the matter , " and referring reporters to the @entity48
the women , who are @entity5 citizens , brought their allegations to a @entity31 government official , and federal authorities then launched an investigation
a search of the station chief 's residence in @entity5 was approved by a @entity31 district court judge after a request from the @entity48
the search found pills believed to be of a type commonly used in date rape , the source said
in that search , authorities also found about a dozen tapes that are thought to show the officer engaged in sexual acts , the source said , including some in which women are believed to be in a semiconscious state
@entity1 's source had not seen the tapes but had been briefed on their content
some of the tapes include date stamps indicating that the recordings happened when he would have been serving in @entity76 , @entity77 , before his tenure in @entity5
the investigation includes his time in both posts as well as other locations where he traveled
the identity of the officer could not be learned , and @entity1 was unable to reach a representative of the officer
it is against the law to reveal identities of covert officers
when the allegations surfaced in the fall , they were viewed as " tremendously explosive , no doubt about that , " the source said , especially because @entity5 is a @entity96 country
the @entity48 and the @entity4 would not comment on the allegations or any investigation
" i can assure you that the agency would take seriously and follow up any allegations of impropriety , " @entity4 spokesman @entity101 said
the officer has not been charged , the source said
the source would not speak for attribution because the investigation is ongoing and the source was not authorized to speak publicly
one federal law enforcement source said that no developments or activities relating to the case are " imminent
" a station chief heads the @entity4 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities in the country
@entity1 producers @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this story .
