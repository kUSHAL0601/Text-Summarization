-- @entity1 believed in @entity2
as we mourn his passing , we also mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the @entity7 , the agreement that culminated his efforts in the @entity11
the physical damage of the war has been largely repaired
while many psychological scars linger , progress is evident in @entity2
ambassador @entity1 knew that progress here was attainable
he was not only a great diplomat but also a true friend to our country
we should honor him by living out his dream for us to succeed and flourish as a nation
as we reflect on the past 15 years , there are still skeptics and critics who express their concerns about political stability
the country has challenges ahead , including the difficult task of changing its constitution
but the world should not have a short memory -- the political situation has improved tremendously since the official end of war on december 14 , 1995
tributes to @entity1 , architect of @entity2 peace @entity2 has signed a @entity38 ( @entity38 ) with the @entity39 and is well on its way to @entity42 membership
on december 15 , the citizens of @entity2 will gain visa - free travel to the @entity39 countries covered by the @entity47 agreement
and @entity2 currently serves as a nonpermanent member of the @entity49 and assumes its presidency in january 2011
that 's a significant achievement for a post-conflict country
these are all clear signs of improvement
there is one key element required for further progress -- economic growth
productive foreign investment will open markets , encourage stability and speed government reform
@entity2 's pre-war industries were destroyed , and a lack of domestic capital has meant that the country 's export and hard currency earning potential in agriculture and food processing , lumber and wood working , hydroelectric power and tourism remain untapped
most analysts expect foreign investment will be stimulated by the country 's entry into @entity42 and eventually the @entity39
it is true that after the war , @entity2 entered into a transitional phase with a corrupt administration and an economic environment that discouraged foreign investment , but many difficulties with post-war corruption are behind us
the investment environment has improved with foreign investments peaking at $ 1.7 billion in 2007 just before the global recession
that 's an impressive number considering @entity2 has only 4.6 million residents
@entity2 has a stable macro-economic environment that includes a strong convertible currency , low inflation and the most developed banking system in southeastern @entity96
the fact that investments in @entity2 have grown indicates that investors have confidence in @entity2 , even before @entity42 membership , and these early investors will reap the greatest rewards
@entity2 will become a member of the @entity39 , an ally of the west and follow the path of @entity108 , the @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112
i was born in @entity2 to an ethnically mixed family
after surviving the war , i immigrated to the @entity115 in 1994
i lived for 14 years in @entity116 , @entity117 , started a family , studied business at @entity120 and electronic business management at @entity122
my first job was as a stack clerk at the liquor store , and i later applied my schooling and worked in technology companies , higher education and for an industrialist , @entity131 @entity130 , who later became one of the chief sponsors of @entity134
after gaining a valuable education and work experience , i decided that i wanted to return to @entity2 to help rebuild a country and region by providing others the opportunity i had to gain a quality education
i wanted to help the people of @entity2 and region to build better lives and a better future
with the support of people i had met during my time in the states , i started the @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , partnering with @entity151 at @entity152
in 2006 , the school opened its doors with 21 students , and today @entity150 has more than 500 students at three campuses
our goal was to overcome ethnic differences and allow young people to learn and work together to build the future of their country
we were committed to building a university with a multi-ethnic body of students who will be future leaders in business and government and who have a shared vision of the country 's successful integration into @entity96
we are building a work force of educated leaders for the new century will be able to support and implement investments in @entity2
their ability to prosper with expanded employment will drive the necessary reforms to modernize government
@entity2 is a relatively small market , but it offers some unique resources , a favorable geographic location and , as a member of the @entity185 , access to millions of consumers in the region
and it offers a diaspora motivated to return and ready to help their homeland by taking positions in the government and opening their own businesses
the readiness of a new generation of @entity2 to commit to their country over a more comfortable life in the @entity200 is proof that young @entity2 are very optimistic about the nation
with increased investment and a new multi-ethnic generation of educated leaders @entity2 and @entity202 will have the bright future @entity1 believed in
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .
