after his talks with @entity13 , the @entity3 leader travels to the shrine of a revered @entity40 saint at @entity41 in @entity43 state
the private tour comes in the wake of @entity3 's recent promise to grant @entity5 " most favored nation " trading status
the @entity50 neighbors have fought three wars , two of them over the @entity59 territory of @entity60 , since the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into @entity54 @entity3 and @entity55 - majority , secular @entity5 after independence from @entity57
last year , both nations pledged not to let their fragile peace process unravel again over the range of thorny issues that put them at odds
in 2004 , the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues , including @entity60 , terrorism and @entity3 's concerns over river dams on the @entity5 side of the border , which it sees as a threat to its water supplies
since then , successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony
@entity13 and @entity2 hailed results from the dialogue in september 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings
but engagements were suspended two months later in november 2008 after the terrorist assault on @entity89 , which left more than 160 people dead
over the past two years , @entity5 and @entity3 have held a series of high - level meetings in their bid to put their peace dialogue back on track , a process considered crucial to regional stability ahead of the withdrawal of @entity100 troops from @entity101
in 2011 , @entity0 and @entity102 agreed to resume talks
" it 's a win - win situation when @entity3 and @entity5 are engaging in dialogue , are talking to each other , and are building better cooperation , " @entity104 , a deputy spokesperson for the @entity105 , said thursday regarding @entity2 's @entity5 visit
