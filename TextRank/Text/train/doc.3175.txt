@entity0 , @entity1 -- when police walked into the home , they found a 5 - year - old girl weighing nearly 160 pounds , her teeth rotting , her skin covered in spider bites
her 4 - year - old sister was lying on a filthy mattress , wearing only a urine - soaked diaper
police were responding to a domestic dispute call at the @entity16 , @entity1 , house monday when they encountered the shocking scene
they called in child abuse investigators , and ultimately arrested the parents , @entity24 and @entity25 , charging both with second - degree child cruelty , @entity20 police spokesman @entity18 said
the children are now in the state custody
their parents were released on bond , but @entity25 was arrested again late thursday for giving " misleading information " to a magistrate judge at the couple 's first court appearance tuesday , said col. @entity35 of the @entity20 sheriff 's department
she remained in jail friday without bond until further notice from court , he said
attempts to reach her husband were unsuccessful friday , and it was n't immediately clear whether they had retained legal counsel
asked by @entity2 affiliate @entity48 on thursday whether the children were mistreated at the home , @entity25 said no. police had only stopped at the family 's home in the @entity0 suburb one other time , more than a year ago , but had n't observed anything like they saw monday , @entity18 said
the house " stunk of urine and mold , " according to the arrest warrants for the @entity61
it is " infested with roaches , [ fleas ] , cobwebs and gigantic spiders , " the documents said
the bathroom and shower are covered in black mold and dirt , they said
neither girl is enrolled in school
the older daughter , who weighs 158 pounds , could not walk 10 feet without " becoming out of breath and wheezing , " officers said
the younger child weighs 89 pounds and still drinks from a baby bottle
her feet were blackened with dirt , her skin also covered in insect bites
" a situation like this is tragic -- tragic for the family , but mostly for the kids , " said @entity86 , executive director of the @entity87 , a trade group representing a range of agencies , including foster homes and family support programs
" this is an extreme case of neglect by the parents , " he said
" these kids are hurting on many levels -- certainly educational development , and probably social development
" @entity86 said it 's unlikely that the @entity104 would be able to regain custody of their children , saying it 's " too late " for the family to avoid foster care .
