@entity0 -- when @entity4 is tasked with debating @entity6 involvement in overseas conflicts , a common refrain from lawmakers is to follow the advice of military commanders
it has been repeated dozens of times , for instance , by sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , when discussing the wars in @entity16 and @entity17
" we urge the administration to work urgently with @entity16 authorities to reach an agreement that reflects the best military advice of @entity6 commanders on the ground , " he wrote in a news release in 2011 about reducing the @entity6 military footprint in @entity16
he said something similar in a 2012 statement about @entity17
now that @entity4 will have its say on @entity6 intervention in @entity32 , it has testimony and documents from top members of the military to reference , and some of the testimony falls short of an enthusiastic endorsement of @entity6 involvement
concerns exist within the ranks of the military over the outcome of such strikes , and those concerns are coupled with worries about strains on an already stretched military
@entity50 : intervention in @entity32 could cost billions a frank assessment of the risks in a series of communications with @entity4 over the summer , gen. @entity50 , chairman of the @entity55 , testified and wrote letters to @entity4 about the risk of @entity6 military involvement in @entity32
chief among them is the challenge that a limited strike remain limited in scope
in an assessment to sen. @entity67 , head of the @entity68 , on july 19 , @entity50 outlined possible scenarios and the risks they bring
@entity50 said @entity6 involvement , even if it 's limited in nature , would probably lead to an extended stay
" once we take action , we should be prepared for what comes next
deeper involvement is hard to avoid , " he wrote
@entity50 explains that risks include retaliatory attacks by the @entity82 regime , civilian casualties and " extremists " -- including @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 -- gaining more control and access to weapons , including chemical weapons
two days before the alleged chemical attacks in @entity32 , @entity50 replied to a request from @entity95 rep. @entity94 on @entity50 's assessment of different military options in @entity32
the general outlined a difficult path for @entity6 success in @entity32
" in a variety of ways , the use of @entity6 military force can change the military balance , but it can not resolve the underlying and historic ethnic , religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict , " @entity50 wrote
" it is my belief that the side we chose must be ready to support their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor
today , they are not
" another high - ranking member of the military urged extreme caution
according to the @entity125 , gen. @entity123 , former head of @entity124 , said at a security conference in july that " this is going to be a full - throated , very , very serious war " if the @entity6 becomes involved
@entity130 chairman @entity129 said he has concerns about the ongoing strategy after an attack
" i 'm concerned about more the military aspects , what are we expecting @entity32 , @entity86 , @entity85 , their other allies in the region to do
what are we doing about any attacks that might happen to @entity142 or @entity143 or @entity144 , other areas in the region , " said @entity129 , @entity139
" for that matter , our embassies around the world
are we doing everything we can to make sure we 're able to protect ourselves should they do any kind of counterattack ? " overstretched military any @entity6 involvement will not be cheap
the @entity6 is coming off a decade - long war in @entity16 and is still fighting a 12 - year - long war in @entity17
additionally , tight budgets caused by forced spending cuts are concerning to those both inside and outside the military
the most likely scenario in @entity32 would be cruise missile strikes followed by a bomb damage assessment , with additional strikes on what was missed or not destroyed
additionally , if the @entity6 goes after chemical weapons capabilities , airstrikes would necessitate taking out @entity32 's air defense and command and control capabilities
@entity50 wrote in his july letter that using " lethal force to prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons " could cost " well over $ 1 billion per month
" he also wrote that controlling chemical weapons would require more resources than just air and cruise missile strikes
he said it would need to be coupled with " thousands of special operations forces and other ground forces " to secure critical sites
president @entity184 , however , has said he would put " no boots " on the ground in @entity32
the $ 1 billion price tag could take a hefty bite out of a slimmed - down military budget
members of the military have testified before @entity4 and released statements about the crippling effect that the forced spending cuts has had on the military
military operations will be " significantly and adversely affected , " an august 10 @entity197 news release said
the military requested and the president proposed a budget of $ 526.6 billion for 2014 , which is 8 % more than what the @entity197 is currently operating with
@entity197 comptroller @entity203 told @entity4 that that request " supports national security interests in a time of very complex challenges
" but it 's unclear whether the military would get its wish
@entity4 has not overturned the forced spending cuts , which would slash $ 52 billion next year
as the military points out , the sequester 's impact in 2014 would be 40 % greater than 2013
sen. @entity214 , @entity215 , said the @entity6 simply ca n't afford to get involved in @entity32
" we 're in a position right now where we do n't have the assets to get involved in another intervention , " he said on @entity1 's " @entity216 " last week
@entity129 had similar concerns about the forced spending cuts
" that is the thing that really concerns me is , sequestration on the backs of our military is making it very difficult for them to carry out mission after mission , " @entity129 said
congressional hawks tie @entity32 to budget cuts in addition to budget cuts , the wars in @entity16 and @entity17 have strained the military but also taught military leaders valuable lessons
@entity50 wrote : " we have learned from the past 10 years ; however , that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state
... should the regime 's institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition , we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control
" rep. @entity252 , @entity253 , echoed @entity50 's sentiment
" the past decade has amply demonstrated the folly of military commitments poorly conceived , " he wrote in a statement
secretary of state @entity258 dismissed that argument
" fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility , " he said friday
despite concerns , support exists however , some former top military leaders are coming out in support of a military strike
gen. @entity268 , the former supreme commander of @entity269 who led military forces in the @entity272 war in 1999 , laid out a grim assessment
" at a time when the @entity6 faces many other security threats , not to mention economic and political challenges at home , it is tempting to view action against @entity32 's regime as a significant distraction
certainly , it also carries risks
... you ca n't always control the script after you decide to launch a limited , measured attack , " he wrote in an opinion piece friday in @entity286
despite his measured tone , he said the humanitarian crisis is the @entity6 's responsibility
" president @entity184 has rightly drawn a line at the use of chemical weapons
some weapons are simply too inhuman to be used
and , as many of us learned during 1990s , in the words of president @entity299 , ' where we can make a difference , we must act
' " @entity50 has not made any public statements about @entity6 intervention
he 's scheduled to testify on tuesday before the @entity304 .
