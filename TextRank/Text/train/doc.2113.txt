-- news that debris was found after an @entity4 flight went missing over the weekend marked the third major incident involving @entity7 airlines this year
in march , @entity8 went missing after it mysteriously deviated from its scheduled flight path from @entity10 to @entity11
the plane is believed to have been lost over the southern @entity13 near @entity14 , yet no wreckage has been found
then , in july , @entity16 was shot down over eastern @entity17 -- possibly by @entity19 separatists , although @entity20 suggested that @entity17 was in some way responsible
so , are passengers traveling in @entity7 rattled ? the latest incident has certainly fanned concern that travelers might lose confidence in regional airlines altogether , particularly @entity29 carriers
yet although @entity31 was an @entity4 flight , it was operated by @entity4 , which is not a @entity29 airline and is instead majority - owned by @entity35 interests
( the @entity4 group has similar minority holdings in subsidiaries in @entity39 , the @entity40 , @entity41 , and , soon , @entity42 , although these subsidiary airlines use the @entity4 brand )
yet while travelers will likely be somewhat unsettled by this year 's developments , @entity4 will probably weather this difficult period
after all , the group pioneered the low - cost model in @entity7 , and has built a strong reputation for affordable and safe flying
until the @entity31 incident , more than 200 million passengers had flown on the @entity4 network , including its long - haul arm @entity55 , with no plane having been lost
led by its formidable founder and ceo @entity58 , the airline has built a reputation as the champion of the average passenger in the face of more expensive full - service carriers
missing planes and air disasters : how bad was 2014 ? in the process , the airline has won the loyalty and gratitude of millions of working - class asians for whom flying has become an affordable reality
it is therefore unlikely that recent unfortunate incidents will be able to change this
what about rivals swooping in to pick up the business ? the reality is that there is no @entity84 low - cost competitor with operations on the scale of @entity4 's
indeed , because of restrictions in most countries in the region that prohibit foreigners from holding majority stakes in local airlines , @entity4 has had to improvise by establishing minority - owned subsidiaries all over @entity7
and , although these are technically separate airlines , their common branding and @entity96 booking platform ensures that there is only one @entity4 in most passengers ' minds
that said , the way @entity4 manages the crisis will also be critical in determining its future
so far , the consensus seems to be that @entity58 is faring pretty well by being open , forthright and consistent with the families and media
however , much will ultimately depend on what actually happened to @entity31
if it is determined to have been a weather - related accident , as has been widely suggested , the traveling public is likely to see this as a one - off event that can eventually be overlooked
it will only be if the airline itself is found to be somehow at fault -- or perhaps if the cause of the incident remains unexplained -- that there may be some lingering concerns among passengers
all this said , air transport is undergoing phenomenal growth in @entity7 , with the region poised to overtake @entity127 as the world 's largest and most dynamic aviation market
this suggests that the three , likely unrelated , incidents this year should not warrant sweeping generalizations or suggestions that airlines in the region have somehow become less safe than airlines elsewhere
of course , such incidents should still serve to remind airlines and governments everywhere that safety is of paramount importance , and that the explosive growth of air travel must also be accompanied by stringent safety and security standards
but for now , passengers in @entity7 are savvy enough to understand the difference between a trend and tragic but isolated accidents .
