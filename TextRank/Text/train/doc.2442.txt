-- the mother of @entity3 founder @entity2 will meet with @entity5 authorities monday to urge them to grant her son asylum
@entity8 , who arrived in the capital city @entity10 on saturday , told reporters she will appeal to @entity5 's stance on human rights during her meeting
" surely , the president and his staff will make the best decision , " @entity8 said , according to a report in the state - run @entity17 website
her son has been holed up inside the @entity23 since applying for political asylum on june 19
he is seeking to avoid being sent to @entity25 over claims of rape and sexual molestation and said he fears if he is extradited there , @entity25 authorities could hand him over to the @entity30
if her son is sent to the @entity30 , he " could expect a sentence of death or many years in prison with torture as they are doing now with @entity37 , " @entity8 said , according to the @entity17 report
" if they did that to a @entity30 citizen , they would have fewer qualms about doing it to a foreigner
" manning is a @entity46 intelligence analyst suspected of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and @entity49 documents while serving in @entity50
many of those documents ended up on the @entity3 website
he is being held on charges of aiding the enemy , wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the @entity57 , transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records , among others
he could go to prison for life if convicted
@entity5 has said it is weighing @entity2 's asylum request and will make the decision on its own , in its own time
' @entity68 ' unlikely to affect @entity2 embassy standoff " @entity5 will make its own , independent decision , " president @entity70 said in an interview to a local television station earlier this month
" the case is under review
" @entity70 noted that capital punishment exists in the @entity30 for a " political crime , " and that fact could be sufficient grounds to grant @entity2 asylum
@entity70 also stressed he is not afraid of international repercussions that might stem from whatever decision @entity5 makes
" we have to see whether everything that 's being done in the case of @entity2 is compatible with ... the constitution and our view of human rights , political rights and due process , " the president said
@entity2 was arrested in @entity92 in 2010 because @entity25 authorities wanted to question him about the sexual molestation and rape allegations , which he denies
his bail conditions included staying every night at the home of a supporter outside @entity99
@entity92 police say he violated his bail by staying at the embassy
after he entered it , they served him with notice to turn himself in -- an order he ignored , marking a further violation
diplomatic protocol prevents police from entering the embassy to arrest him
@entity8 said saturday her son was being treated well at the embassy
" i am grateful for the facilities @entity5 offered to my son in @entity99 , " she said
two women have accused @entity2 of sexually assaulting them in august 2010 , when he was visiting @entity25 in connection with a @entity3 release of internal @entity30 military documents
he was arrested in @entity92 that december and has been fighting extradition since , saying the allegations are retribution for his organization 's disclosure of @entity30 secrets
@entity122 of the @entity2 defense fund has said the @entity30 had empaneled a grand jury in its goal to press charges against the @entity3 founder
turning himself in to @entity92 authorities would start a process that would end with @entity2 being extradited to the @entity30 , @entity128 said
@entity3 , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information , has published about 250,000 confidential @entity30 diplomatic cables , causing embarrassment to the government and others
it also has published hundreds of thousands of classified @entity30 documents relating to the conflicts in @entity50 and @entity140
@entity2 sought refuge at the embassy five days after the @entity142 of the @entity92 dismissed a bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to @entity25 , his last option in @entity92 courts
@entity92 officials have met with @entity5 authorities , but no information has been released about those meetings
see yourself as another @entity2 ? good luck
