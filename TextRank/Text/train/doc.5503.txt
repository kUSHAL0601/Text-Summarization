@entity0 -- a seismic researcher told @entity1 sunday that he warned the owner of the earthquake - damaged @entity5 nuclear power plant two years ago that the facility could be vulnerable to a tsunami
the owner , @entity10 , appeared to ignore the warning , said seismologist @entity12
@entity10 has not responded to @entity12 's allegation
@entity12 heads @entity15 's @entity14
he said he told members of a @entity10 safety committee two years ago that data collected from layers of earth show that in the year 869 a massive tsunami devastated where the plant now is
the six - unit @entity5 plant is located about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0
without adequate safety measures , a repeat of the first millennium disaster at the site of a nuclear power plant could be far worse , @entity12 said he told the committee then
he said he raised the issue because no one else did
" i found that odd so i really wanted to speak out and let people know about it , " @entity12 said
" no one reacted in any way
" instead , committee members discussed a 1938 earthquake in the region that killed only one person
@entity12 said that is understandable because there was far more data available about that event
however , the power company should have considered the 869 tsunami , he said
@entity10 representatives have held frequent press conferences since the march 11 earthquake triggered @entity15 's nuclear crisis
however , critics say direct questions rarely get direct answers from the company
that includes @entity57 's allegation
one critic is the @entity15 government , which on sunday pressed @entity10 for better information about the @entity5 plant as it battled against criticism of its own handling of the crisis there
@entity67 , the government 's point man for the crisis , issued what he called " stronger instructions " to the @entity10 to fully disclose as much as possible about conditions at the plant
" every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly " to @entity15 's @entity75 , @entity67 , the chief cabinet secretary , told reporters
" without this communication , it 's very difficult for the government to ( establish ) proper safety measures
" workers have spent more than two weeks trying to stave off potential meltdowns in three reactors at the plant
@entity67 said @entity10 needs to be up - front with the @entity15 people -- millions of whom get power from the company , and millions more have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis
@entity10 is @entity15 's largest utility
both the company and the @entity15 government have been criticized for failing to provide more detailed information about the situation at @entity5 , one of three nuclear plants the company owns in northern @entity15
a poll by @entity15 's @entity100 found the government is getting poor marks for its handling of the crisis , with 58 % telling pollsters that they disapprove
though 57 % of @entity15 approve of how the government has moved to provide relief for victims of the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , the poll found , only 39 % approve of how it has managed the situation at @entity5
@entity67 said the government has done " everything possible
" " but we also realize that many of the people in the affected areas have been very inconvenienced , and they are in a very serious crisis , " he added
" we understand that , and there may be more such difficulties ahead
" @entity67 said prime minister @entity121 has been talking with local leaders " one by one " to find out what they need
he declined to share details of those conversations , telling reporters , " we are simply focusing on providing better assistance for the residents
" @entity130 , the director - general of the @entity131 , returned to his native @entity15 shortly after the crisis erupted to press @entity121 for more information
" in the beginning , we had some difficulty , " @entity130 told @entity1 sunday
" but i went to @entity0 and i talked to prime minister @entity121 and i asked him to facilitate the flow of information
" @entity121 " promised me the highest level of transparency , and the flow improved , " he said
the government has ordered residents within a 20 - kilometer ( 13 - mile ) radius to evacuate and those living from 20 to 30 kilometers to stay indoors
but levels of radioactivity above the levels considered safe for infants have turned up in drinking water as far south as @entity0 , and the anti-nuclear environmental group @entity151 said sunday that it had found high radiation levels in @entity153 , a town of 7,000 about 40 kilometers northwest the plant
@entity155 , a radiation monitor for @entity151 , said radiation levels ranged between .008 to 0.01 millisieverts per hour , or more than 50 times normal readings
though that 's a dose far below the levels that would cause radiation sickness , it presents " a serious risk for developing cancer in the longer term , " he told @entity1
" people living there -- and there are still people living there -- would exceed the maximum annual permitted dose in just a couple of days , " @entity155 said
he said the town 's mayor is seeking " practical , correct information " from the @entity15 government
" without the right information , you can not take the needed precautionary measures to protect yourself from radiation , " he said
" we think that , to the population , is really important
" @entity183 , a @entity121 spokesman , said the government understands the nuclear crisis has become " an issue of global attention
" traces of radioactive iodine have been detected in @entity194 's @entity193 province , the @entity196 state of @entity197 and as far away as @entity198 , authorities there announced over the weekend
none of those readings have been strong enough to harm public health -- and the @entity196 , @entity202 and @entity203 have put restrictions on imports of food products from some regions of @entity15
@entity1 's @entity208 in @entity0 and @entity209 in @entity210 contributed to this report
