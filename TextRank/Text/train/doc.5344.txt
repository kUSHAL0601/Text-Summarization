@entity1 , @entity0 -- a legal battle has put the future of @entity5 in jeopardy , according to @entity7 , which owns the online communications system
@entity5 's online phone and video communication service has been incredibly popular
if @entity5 loses the right to use a key part of its software and ca n't create an adequate replacement , " @entity5 's business as currently conducted would likely not be possible , " @entity7 said in its quarterly filing with the @entity17
there is no sign of @entity5 disappearing soon -- a relief to the more than 480 million registered users who have video or telephone conversations online through the technology
but the battle with @entity26 , the company that created the piece of technology at issue , shows no sign of being resolved anytime soon , either
@entity26 complains that @entity5 broke its licensing agreement to use the technology
@entity5 filed suit against @entity26 in @entity34 , saying it could not terminate the license agreement ; @entity36 struck back with a counterclaim saying @entity5 had broken the agreement
a trial is scheduled for june 2010 , @entity7 said in the @entity17 filing
" although @entity5 is confident of its legal position , as with any litigation , there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation , " @entity7 writes
" @entity5 has begun to develop alternative software to that licensed through @entity26
however , such software development may not be successful , may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful , and will in any event be expensive
" in an e-mail to @entity2 , @entity36 said @entity5 " accessed @entity26 's source code and modified it -- @entity36 then claimed a breach of license
" @entity5 denies any breach
" @entity26 is enforcing its rights in the courts , " @entity36 said in the e-mail
" like any member of the creative industries , @entity26 will defend its innovations with determination
" @entity2 's @entity67 and @entity68 contributed to this report .
