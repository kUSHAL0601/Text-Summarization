@entity0 -- at least 55 people were killed and scores more wounded when bombs exploded across @entity5 on tuesday , a stark reminder of the violence and instability that grips the country 10 years after the start of the @entity12 - led war
the attacks -- 17 car bombs , seven roadside bombs , and two shootings -- ripped mostly through @entity18 neighborhoods of @entity0 , but also struck @entity20 communities in other towns
at least 187 people were wounded
interactive : @entity5 10 years on the level of carnage has dropped considerably since the height of the sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007 that nearly tore @entity5 apart
but the continuing violence serves as a near daily reminder of the violence poses to the fragile political and economic gains in a @entity5
it 's the second time in less than a week that the @entity35 capital has endured major simultaneous attacks
ten years on , the war left more than 134,000 @entity35 and more than 4,800 @entity12 and other coalition service members dead
the war cost hundreds of billions of dollars
" it remains entrenched and pervasive , with a clear beginning but no foreseeable end , and very much a part of the present in @entity5 , " said @entity42 , a @entity44 - based group that tracks war deaths
" in major regions of the country armed violence continues to exact a remorseless toll on human life , young and old , male and female , across society
" in tuesday 's violence , car bombs rocked @entity0 neighborhoods long engulfed in conflict , like @entity59 and @entity60
they struck @entity62 in eastern @entity0 and the fortified @entity63 , also known as the @entity64 , where the city 's international presence is concentrated
they hit cities north and south of the capital as well
authorities defused four car bombs in the southern city of @entity73
attackers set off roadside bombs , another potent weapon for @entity35 insurgents and a defining symbol of the war
one of those bombs rattled @entity0 's teeming @entity18 slum of @entity81
the @entity12 mission in @entity5 condemned the attacks in @entity0 and in other provinces -- such as @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89
it was not immediately clear whether the attacks were related
no group immediately claimed responsibility for them
ten years later , @entity5 is on pins and needles change can be seen in the once war - torn nation
a robust form of democracy has taken hold
sunnis , @entity102 , @entity103 and others often work together
there is more political , economic and social stability
coalition forces that ousted @entity109 's government have departed
however , recent attacks in @entity18 areas have spread fear among @entity35 that sectarian warfare between @entity20 and @entity102 may ravage the country again
attacks targeting the @entity116 last week left 30 dead and 50 wounded in strikes authorities suspect were carried out by @entity119 in @entity5
@entity20 had more political clout during @entity109 's reign
the @entity102 and the @entity103 , the other two main groups , were second - class citizens
since @entity109 was toppled , the tables have turned
shiites -- the largest religious group in the country -- predominate in government
the @entity129 semiautonomous region in the north , and the @entity103 themselves , have more clout
today , @entity20 feel they 've been politically marginalized
they demand that the @entity18 - led government stop what they call negative treatment of @entity5 's @entity20 community
@entity20 largely boycotted @entity5 's 2005 elections , leading to the emergence of a @entity18 - led government
the move left the once - ruling minority disaffected
the deteriorating security situation prompted authorities to postpone provincial council elections scheduled for april in the predominantly @entity20 provinces of @entity85 and @entity145
expert : the @entity148 conflict is hitting home in @entity5 @entity150 , an expert on @entity5 , said the attacks were probably " prescheduled for the anniversary
" he also said the latest violence reflects the @entity18 sectarian tensions raging next door in @entity148
he believes such attacks illustrate the revival of the " capability and confidence " of @entity119 in @entity5 , buoyed by a @entity148 uprising " spearheaded by @entity20 militancy
" it stands to reason that the attackers are targeting the government of @entity35 prime minister @entity165
the @entity18 - dominated government is helping neighboring @entity167 , the largest @entity18 nation in the world and a supporter of the @entity171 - dominated @entity148 government
" @entity119 in @entity5 is becoming less exclusive to @entity5
they are trying to channel energy and piggyback off the @entity148 revolution by aiming to merge @entity5 and @entity148 into one theater of sectarian war , " said @entity150 , adjunct fellow at the @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity174
" given that @entity165 is helping @entity167 prop up the @entity148 regime , @entity180 is advertising their cause and looking to attract the support and resources of militant groups in @entity148
" @entity150 said @entity20 militants are baiting @entity165 and @entity102 to retaliate
" they 're working overtime to plunge @entity5 back to sectarian war
but more important than the attacks will be how the @entity102 respond
restraint will be key , but harder to achieve should attacks against @entity102 continue
@entity5 has already entered the electoral season , where everyone on the political scene fuels the fear factor towards their respective sectarian corners
" it is likely that these attacks are n't going to taper off soon , he said
" what 's going on is a campaign , nothing isolated
the @entity148 revolution is a strategic force of instability and will continue to provide both rationale and support to @entity20 trying to fight @entity102 anywhere in the region , " he said
" growing @entity20 discontent directed towards @entity165 's government could be providing more cover for @entity119 fighters to operate than before
" the @entity215 administration marks the milestone @entity12 president @entity215 and secretary of state @entity217 marked the 10th anniversary of the war 's beginning with statements praising the service members who fought in @entity5
@entity215 honored the more than 1.5 million service members and civilians who served there and the memory of the nearly 4,500 @entity12 who died there
" the last of our troops left @entity5 with their heads held high in 2011 , and the @entity12 continues to work with our @entity35 partners to advance our shared interest in security and peace
" @entity215 said a strong @entity236 would help veterans pursue jobs and education
" we must ensure that the more than 30,000 @entity12 wounded in @entity5 receive the care and benefits they deserve and that we continue to improve treatment for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder
" @entity245 and @entity215 also praised the sacrifices of service members ' families
" our reflections include the @entity35 people -- the @entity35 soldiers and police officers who died alongside our own , the men and women who were caught in the crossfire , and those who still struggle today to secure and govern their nation , " @entity245 said
" the @entity35 people will determine the future of @entity5 and the @entity12 will continue to support their efforts for a peaceful , secure , free , and prosperous nation
" @entity1 's @entity261 reported from @entity0
@entity1 's @entity262 reported from @entity263 .
