@entity0 -- a 63 - year - old man wanted in connection with the murder of five people in a remote @entity7 hamlet has been captured after a manhunt involving more than 400 police
three bodies were found on sunday after two houses in @entity15 , a tiny community in western @entity18 's @entity12 prefecture , were gutted by a " suspicious " fire , @entity12 police spokesman @entity10 told @entity1 on wednesday
the following morning , two more corpses were found a few hundred meters away in the same neighborhood in the victims ' respective homes
an autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head , prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer , @entity10 said
the wanted man -- who lived next to the burned out houses -- disappeared , prompting a huge manhunt
police found the man in the mountains barely 1 km from the village
he was barefoot , wearing only his underwear when he was discovered , police spokesman @entity36 told @entity1
the man was then taken to the nearest police station at @entity40 for questioning
the case attracted significant media attention after a note , apparently written in the form of a " haiku " poem -- a short form of @entity7 verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man 's home
according to the authorities , the poem translated as : " setting on fire , smoke gives delight , to country fellows
" they have refused to draw a link between the poem and the killings
@entity15 is a remote , mountainous community with less than 20 inhabitants
according to local media , the arrested man lived alone , and moved into the neighborhood about 20 years ago to take care of his elderly parents
reports suggested the man grew increasingly alienated in the small community after his parents died about 7 - 8 years ago
one of the victims frequently quarreled with him over his dog , according to @entity75 , @entity18 's largest newspaper .
