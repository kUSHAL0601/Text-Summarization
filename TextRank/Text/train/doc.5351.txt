-- if you are a coffee lover you might be tempted to pay for a cup of the most expensive coffee in the world
@entity6 's velvety tasting brew , @entity5 , gives new meaning to rich coffee
it can cost up to $ 50 per cup
" the supply is very limited in the world that makes the price is very expensive , " @entity5 brand managing director @entity11 said
the reason the supply is limited has to do with how the beans are initially processed
just a warning here , it is n't pretty
@entity5 means coffee in @entity6 and @entity21 is a wild @entity23 palm civet , a fury creature that looks like a cross between a cat and a ferret
the civet climbs the coffee trees to find the best berries , eats them , digests the berries and eventually out comes the coffee beans in its stools
farmers then pick up the civet droppings and take the beans to a processing plant
something about the gastric juices in the civet 's stomach gives @entity5 its unique flavor
" i do like it
compared to other kinds of coffee , it has a more distinctive coffee taste and aroma , " customer @entity45 said as he sipped his coffee after watching the ritual of making a cup of the expensive brew
at a @entity56 in @entity57 the staff brings out a gold - lined cup , a hot thermos of water and vacuum packed sealed package of the @entity5
the package is opened and poured into the cup and then the hot water is poured in
it is stirred and then covered
you have to wait two minutes before sipping it
when i first saw it being made i recoiled
i thought : " i 'm paying all this money for instant coffee , no way ! " but after taking the first sip i felt a little better
it is very smooth with hints of chocolate and caramel flavors and it does n't have that acidic aftertaste that coffee sometimes does
for years it has been more popular overseas than in @entity6 but that is fast changing as the economy in the country continues to grow at a rate far faster than those in the west
" we opened @entity56 in 2002 and already have 20 stores , " @entity11 said
it has become even more popular around the world after it was featured on " @entity104 " and in the @entity95 movie " @entity96 " where @entity98 's character was obsessed with it ( not knowing of course what made it so special until the end )
@entity5 's growing popularity and the way its made has run into trouble
it has been given some nasty names such as " crappuccino " and inspired two of @entity114 main @entity113 organizations to consider putting a fatwa on it because the process appeared to be ritually unclean
but that all changed , @entity11 said , after a bit of explanation about the bean when it is excreted
" it still has the skin , inner layer
and we do the cleansing process , before we do processing and roasting
it 's not a problem
and now , the @entity5 is certified halal , " he said
and it is being enjoyed for a heck of a lot less in its home country than elsewhere
a cup costs about $ 8 in @entity6 as opposed to up to $ 50 in other countries
" i feel it 's the type of thing you have to do once at least , " an @entity140 customer who happened to visiting @entity6 said .
