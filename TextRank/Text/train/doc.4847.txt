-- pastor @entity1 grabbed his first @entity3 victory as the @entity4 impressively held off @entity6 's @entity5 to win sunday 's @entity8 @entity7 , but his celebrations were muted by a fire in his team 's pit - lane garage
in only his second @entity3 season , @entity1 secured @entity15 ' first win since 2004 despite losing the early advantage of his pole position , thanks to some timely pit stops after @entity5 raced away from him at the start
@entity1 's second pit stop proved key to his victory and @entity5 then had to work hard to hold off @entity24 ' @entity23 , with the @entity26 's teammate @entity25 finishing fourth , while @entity27 of @entity28 was fifth and @entity30 's @entity29 sixth
@entity5 and defending champion @entity29 are tied on points in the 2012 standings after a race that produced the season 's fifth winner in five races , though the @entity38 driver stays ahead on count back
@entity1 had started on pole after @entity42 's @entity41 was relegated to the back of the grid on saturday because of a technical fuel breach , which resulted in the exclusion of all the @entity48 's qualifying times by the race stewards
@entity41 fought up from the back of the grid to eighth , with teammate @entity52 taking ninth
" i think it 's a wonderful day , not just for me but for all the team , " said @entity1
" we have been pushing so hard since last year to try to improve race by race and here we are
" @entity59 @entity5 added : " second place at home feels fantastic and thanks to the people that came here and the people at home and hopefully a step forward in terms of championship possibilities
" however @entity15 ' celebrations at @entity1 's win were marred after a fire broke out in the team 's garage just over an hour after the race finished as the @entity77 pit lane was engulfed in thick smoke
a number of personnel from the @entity15 , @entity82 and @entity83 teams were taken to the medical center , though no serious injuries have been confirmed
of the 31 people taken to the medical center , 24 were released and the remaining seven were transferred to local hospitals for treatment
" all the team 's employees have been accounted for and four people have been taken to the circuit medical center for examination ; one with a minor hand injury and three with respiratory issues , " said @entity83
@entity3 's governing body the @entity97 and the @entity8 authorities have opened an investigation into the fire
meanwhile , @entity103 driver @entity102 's collision with @entity15 ' @entity104 on lap 12 proved costly for @entity38 's seven - time world champion , who was handed a five - place grid penalty for the @entity107 later this month
race stewards decided @entity102 was at fault in the incident which forced the retirement of both drivers .
