-- a day after @entity1 @entity2 announced greater political participation for women in the future , some @entity1 questioned just how big a change may really be on the horizon
some women 's rights activists who were initially elated by sunday 's announcement said they were feeling disappointed because the changes do not kick in immediately
" we do n't really think now that we 've been promised a real right , " said one
but a member of @entity1 's @entity15 called one of the changes the king announced " hugely important
" @entity2 announced two changes sunday , which would be historic for @entity1
he said women will be allowed to serve as members of the @entity22 , the @entity15 that advises the king
its 150 members are appointed
the king also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections
it is unknown when those may ultimately take place
the changes do not apply to elections scheduled for this thursday -- which will be only the second set of elections in the kingdom since 1963
while the king did not use the word " vote " in his remarks , allowing women to take part in the nomination process would amount to voting within @entity1 's system
" we do n't really think now that we 've been promised a real right because it 's been postponed
" said @entity50 , a prominent @entity1 women 's rights activist
" the king could have said this is happening now because the next election is going to happen this thursday -- it would n't have been a problem to postpone this election for a month and have women participate in this round
" " for the shura council it 's another year and a half , for the municipal election it 's another four years -- anything could happen during that time , " she said
" whatever can be given can be taken
" " that will give time for extremists to reverse the decision , " said @entity65
" the government thinks they will give time for people to adjust to the idea , but if you 're against something , you 'll never change your mind and if you 're for it you 'll never change your mind
why do they hesitate when it comes to women 's issues ? the government always hesitates
" this thursday 's elections come after more than two years of delays , so any time frame for when future elections may take place is not seen as a solid plan
@entity90 said the announcement that women will be given the right to vote is " no guarantee of rights
" " it is a welcome , albeit limited , step along the long road towards gender equality in @entity1 , and a testament to the long struggle of women 's rights activists there , " said @entity97 , the human rights group 's deputy director for the @entity99 and @entity100 , in a statement
" it is , however , much overdue and does not go nearly far enough
" " the whole system of women 's subordination to men in @entity1 needs to be dismantled , " @entity97 said
@entity112 , one of the 150 members of the @entity15 , expressed no doubts that women will join the council in 2013 , and called it a very significant step
" i think it 's hugely important , " he said
" they will be full members of the @entity22 just like anybody else
we have women advisers , but in the next round of @entity22 appointments , they will be full members of the committee just like any other member
" the @entity128 notes that there are 13 advisers on the council
@entity112 said the 13 advise the council , but are not among the 150 members
the changes the king announced follow increasing pressure , from outside and inside @entity1 , to give women the right to vote and greater political participation
earlier this year , @entity1 women activists wrote the government requesting that women be allowed to vote and be candidates in the municipal elections , according to the @entity146 @entity145
@entity1 's " minister of municipality and rural affairs declared that @entity1 women will not be able to either run or vote in this election , " the @entity145 reported on its blog
" according to news reports , the minister stated that the ban on women 's participation is due to the lack of segregated voting facilities
" when election centers opened in april for voters to register , some groups of women turned up and were turned away
it was one of the first public acts of the " @entity164 , " a movement set up to campaign for the end of @entity1 's discriminatory laws
in june , a number of @entity1 women took to the streets -- in cars -- to demand the right for women to drive and travel freely in the country
there are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in @entity1
however , religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers
such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian
authorities stopped @entity189 , 32 , for driving a car may 21 and detained her the next day
she said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail
her case became a rallying cry for women activists
the @entity128 's human rights report on @entity1 , published in 2011 , notes many challenges facing women in @entity1 in 2010 : " by law a female rape victim is at fault for illegal ' mixing of genders ' and is punished along with the perpetrator
" " women continued to face discrimination under the law and remained uninformed about their rights
although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian , women have few political or social rights , and society does not treat them as equal members
" " the guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her ' guardian ' with the authority to approve her travel
" " women risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative
" " women also faced discrimination in courts , where the testimony of one man equals that of two women
" " the law requires a woman to obtain the permission of a male guardian to work if the type of business is not ' deemed appropriate for a woman
' " the report also noted some improvements
" increased efforts to protect women and children against domestic violence through the @entity247 , as well as the @entity248 , reflected a significant human rights achievement , " the report said
it also noted that in 2010 , " women increasingly participated in political life , albeit with significantly less status than men
" @entity0 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .
