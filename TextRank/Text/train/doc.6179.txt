@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 has pledged more than $ 500 million for famine victims in @entity1 as the @entity5 met in emergency session monday to address the aid response in @entity1 , the hardest - hit nation in the region
" immediate relief and recovery is the first priority , and it is important to act fast to reduce human suffering , " @entity3 president @entity9 said in a news release
also monday , representatives of 191 member countries of the @entity5 's @entity18 met in @entity19 to devise a plan to head off the imminent food crisis , which the @entity5 has said is affecting more than 12 million people
two regions in southern @entity1 are suffering famine
" world leaders have no excuses for not generously responding , " @entity26 chief executive @entity25 said in a statement
" this should not be happening
it is a colossal outrage that the warnings went unheeded , that the lessons of previous famines have been ignored
yes , we need to save lives today , but we also need to ensure that people have a future
above all , we need to build a global food system that allows everyone enough to eat
" but such efforts will take time to translate into aid on the ground for the many people in @entity1 whose needs are immediate
in @entity0 , across the border from @entity50 , @entity48 workers were registering women and children monday in a rocky square in this dusty town dotted with thorn bushes
in a visit monday by @entity2 , no one appeared to be receiving aid , and no one was receiving medical help -- they were just getting registered
aid officials said they hoped to get food to areas in need in the coming days
they said that some people who had fled across the border into neighboring @entity50 or @entity67 were returning after hearing that distribution was set to begin soon
at a second registration point nearby , neat lines of women , their children and grandchildren also waited to get registered
mixed with the town 's residents were people who had fled from other parts of the country in search of aid
children were drinking water from an oil drum perched atop a donkey
@entity2 's journalists reached the town by driving in a convoy protected by armed militia members aligned with the government
the militant @entity91 group @entity90 , which has sworn allegiance to @entity93 and is designated a terrorist group by the @entity95 , is less than 50 miles away and could easily move into this area if they wished , according to @entity5 security officials on the scene
@entity90 has reversed a pledge to allow foreign aid agencies to operate in famine - struck regions in the nation
the group originally banned the aid agencies from areas under its control in 2009 , describing them as @entity108 spies and @entity110 crusaders
" we are building up in @entity114 , where we are reaching up to 300,000 people , " @entity111 , executive director of the @entity48 , said about the violence - ravaged capital
" but the @entity48 has lost 14 people since 2008 , just trying to get kids food
it 's dangerous , and it 's risky , and we are committed to going to where the people need the most
" the @entity48 has airlifted supplies to @entity0 , which borders @entity50
" one thing that is important is to get the supplementary nutritional foods to these children , because children get very weak quickly on these treks , " @entity111 said
the @entity128 said operating in the nation is a challenge
" we have teams deployed throughout the country , " said @entity132 , a spokesman for the @entity133
" logistically , it is very complex to operate in @entity1
" more funds are needed to expand aid , the spokesman said
" we are covering most of the most vulnerable people in the areas we reach , but more needs to be done , " he said
" if we can get more money , we can do it
" he said the @entity128 was continuing to operate throughout @entity1 , as it has for the past 20 years , without encountering problems with @entity90
" we are deployed in all provinces , while most of the organizations have just a few spots , " he said
the @entity3 announced monday that it is providing more than $ 500 million to assist drought victims and $ 12 million in immediate aid to the hardest - hit areas
the drought has led to starvation and the loss of crops and livestock
food prices have nearly tripled in some areas since last year , worsening the crisis
the funds will go toward battling the worst drought in 60 years in @entity160 nations , including @entity50 , @entity67 and @entity161 , the @entity3 said
the pledge comes as international aid groups warned that most @entity1 have no access to food , and failure to reach them puts children most at risk as their parents trek for days in search of help
" women have been telling us throughout the area that they 've had to leave children along the road who ca n't make it , who are too weak to make it and have died along the way , " @entity111 said
as the crisis escalates , relief agencies are scrambling to find ways to deliver supplements to areas that are hardest - hit
about 60 % of the @entity1 population is not getting aid , @entity111 said
aid groups are hoping to reach @entity1 in the country before they flee to overcrowded camps in @entity67 and @entity50 for help
" when children have to move long distances , their bodies deteriorate very quickly , " @entity111 said
" for children under 5 years old , their bodies and brains ca n't grow normally
" @entity2 's @entity198 contributed to this report .
