@entity0 -- a plan to allow presidential assailant @entity4 to spend more time away from his government mental hospital and eventually to become a permanent outpatient " lacks specificity , " a psychiatrist who has closely followed @entity4 's case for over a decade said tuesday
testifying on the 10th day of a federal court hearing over @entity4 's status , dr. @entity10 said , " we are talking about putting someone in a community for extended time who has been institutionalized for 30 years for trying to assassinate the president
" he said the proposal by @entity21 hospital to let @entity4 spend much more time visiting his mother at her home in @entity24 , @entity25 , " is not good enough " because it lacks firm details about what kind of therapy sessions , group sessions and art and music classes @entity4 could attend in @entity24
@entity10 said the @entity25 mental facility that agreed to provide outpatient programs for @entity4 has not received records from @entity21 about @entity4 's condition it needs in order to construct a program for him
@entity4 , 56 , was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of president @entity42 , press secretary @entity43 , secret service agent @entity44 and d.c. police officer @entity45
the four men survived the attack , but @entity43 was shot in the head and left permanently disabled , and @entity45 's wound forced him to retire shortly afterward
the psychiatrist , who is acting as an expert medical witness for the government , testified for the second day on tuesday in proceedings on @entity4 's future freedoms
@entity4 currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in @entity25
officials at @entity21 want to increase that to two visits of 17 days to be followed by six visits of 24 days
@entity21 is seeking authority to then decide whether @entity4 can be released as a permanent outpatient
during the 10 days of hearings , various experts have said @entity4 's most severe illnesses -- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in full remission
however , @entity10 said he does not agree @entity4 's depression is in full remission and says he displays some symptoms , including sullen behavior and weight gain
@entity10 said this alone does n't mean @entity4 should n't spend more time in @entity24 , but he said @entity4 's doctors and case manager need to pay close attention to the problem
witnesses have testified @entity4 has been taking @entity77 for several years after complaining of anxiety
@entity10 said he thinks the drug is also meant to help with depression
@entity4 's defense attorney , @entity81 , took issue with @entity10
@entity81 ticked off a list of symptoms for major depressive disorder from a psychiatry publication that said a patient would need to have five of those symptoms to be suffering from the disorder
@entity10 acknowledged that @entity4 does not appear to have five of the symptoms but persisted in his view that @entity4 is experiencing some level of depression
@entity81 noted all of the concerns raised by @entity10 -- including @entity4 's relationships with women , the fact that he is sometimes deceptive and his social isolation -- and said that despite those issues , @entity4 had not engaged in violent behavior
@entity10 said he did not think @entity21 should be given authority to decide if and when @entity4 is permanently released from the hospital
@entity105 district court judge @entity104 indicated in december that he thinks that decision should rest with him
the hearing will resume next week
@entity4 has the right to testify , but his lawyer said he does not expect to call him .
