@entity2 an idealist who became disillusioned by what was being done in @entity6 and elsewhere in the name of @entity9 national interests , as the attorney for the former army intelligence analyst has argued ? or is he , as the prosecution contends , a traitor who leaked classified material to @entity16 that he knew could assist terrorists ? the formal answers to those questions , at least , will come in the anticipated verdict by a military judge , who will decide @entity2 's guilt or innocence in a case that has been described as the largest leak of classified material in @entity9 history
authorities have accused @entity2 of delivering three - quarters of million pages of classified documents and videos to @entity16 -- which has never confirmed the soldier was the source of its information -- about everything from the @entity9 military strategy in @entity6 to @entity38 cables detailing its foreign relationships
there is little debate over the basics of the case : @entity2 pleaded guilty in february to 10 lesser charges related to the leaks , and spent more than an hour in court reading a statement that detailed why and how he sent classified material to @entity16 -- a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website
but @entity2 refused to plead guilty to the most serious allegations , including that of aiding enemies of the @entity9 -- a charge that falls under the @entity55 and carries a sentence of life in prison , if convicted
as the soldier sits in a military prison cell at @entity63 's @entity62 awaiting word of his fate , questions remain about what damage his actions caused to @entity9 intelligence gathering
the answer depends on who is doing in the talking
" @entity72 asked for some of the information himself , " the prosecutor , @entity77 maj. @entity76 , said during his closing argument thursday , referring to the documents provided to @entity16 by @entity2
but @entity2 's attorney , @entity80 , told the court friday that despite claims that the leaks harmed national security , the @entity77 did not make any major changes to its operation
it 's a sentiment that has been echoed publicly by his supporters
" they really have not reported any great impact
more embarrassment than anything else , " @entity93 of the @entity94 , an online group that supports the soldier 's actions and has been raising funds for his legal defense
embarrassing or not , the publication of the leaks rocked the @entity9 government , with then - secretary of state @entity102 saying the release of the material threatened the lives of @entity9 and damaged foreign relationships
prosecution witnesses have testified @entity2 downloaded and leaked 400,000 @entity109 field reports from @entity6 and 90,0000 similar documents from @entity111
there evidence also was presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 @entity38 cables
' collateral murder ' video for most people , the story began on april 5 , 2010 , when @entity16 released a video that it called " collateral murder
" the video was shot from a @entity9 @entity122 helicopter as it opened fire on a group of people in @entity126 in 2007 , killing a dozen people
among the dead were a @entity130 tv news cameraman and his driver
the video showed @entity130 ' @entity132 survived an initial strafing by the helicopter , but apparently died when it opened fire again -- this time on people attempting to get him off the sidewalk where he lay and into a van
the footage quickly made news , elevating what was once a virtually unknown @entity16 to a globally recognized name
later , a @entity9 investigation into the attack found that the crew mistook the journalists ' cameras for weapons while seeking out insurgents who had been firing at @entity9 troops in the area
but , according to court documents and testimony , by the time the world saw the video , @entity2 had already downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified documents and videos
within months , @entity2 was behind bars , accused of using his computer skills to commit what the government called treason
from @entity164 to @entity6 it was a far cry from his beginnings
hailing from the small @entity164 town of @entity170 , population less than 1,300 , he was a gearhead with a love of computer games and a passion for current events , his friends and family told @entity0 in 2011
after working a series of part - time jobs and , at one point , living out of his car , he joined the @entity77 in 2007
but it was a tough acclimation , his friends later said , in large part because of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy
according to friends and his own writings on the @entity188 , @entity2 is openly gay
then , in 2009 , @entity2 deployed to @entity6
he was at @entity189 in southeast @entity126 , where he worked as an analyst reviewing possible threats to @entity9 troops
according to @entity76 , the prosecutor , within two weeks of his arrival in @entity6 , @entity2 began working with @entity16 founder @entity195 over what to leak and how to do it
@entity195 has taken refuge at the @entity199 in @entity200 to avoid extradition to @entity202 to face questioning in sex - crimes allegations , charges he claims are a ruse by allies of @entity208 to arrest him and then extradite him to the @entity9 to face charges
@entity2 spent hours at work during off - hours downloading documents , @entity76 said
@entity2 , the prosecutor said , was well aware of the military 's policy about divulging classified material and the repercussions of doing it
the soldier had even taught classes about protecting the material , @entity76 said
" @entity2 had no allegiance to the @entity9 , " @entity76 told the court last week , adding that he was " not a whistle - blower ; he was a traitor
" but @entity2 's attorney offered another picture , one in which the war deeply affected his client
it began , his attorney told the court , after an attack on a convoy with his comrades
a roadside bomb exploded beneath a car full of civilians that had pulled aside to let the military vehicles pass
although members of his 305th @entity244 were not hurt , @entity80 said , at least one civilian was killed
that changed @entity2 's outlook on the war , his lawyer said
" he was further disturbed by the " @entity251 " video , the attorney said
" did they all deserve to die ? that is what @entity1
@entity2 is seeing when he watches this , " @entity80 told the judge after playing the video in court
it was for those reasons , according to @entity80 , that @entity2 then started selecting information to reveal , believing that it would be better if it were public
@entity80 said his client was selective in the information he diverted from a controlled - access computer system where he worked as an " all source " intelligence analyst
what would you do ? @entity2 came to the attention of authorities in may 2010 after a confidential informant , later identified as ex-hacker @entity273 of @entity274 , @entity275 , came forward with a stunning story
it began with a message said to be posted by @entity2 , using the instant message handle " bradass87
" " if you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8 + months , what would you do ? " it read
according to testimony , that was purportedly part of a string of instant messages that a person sent to @entity273 , who was convicted in 2004 for hacking the @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity294 computer systems
over a period of days beginning on may 22 , 2010 , @entity273 testified , he and the man identified as manning instant - messaged about the release of the documents and videos
@entity273 has said he reported manning to authorities
@entity302 special agent @entity301 has testified that the chat logs that @entity273 provided to the @entity77 largely matched chat logs found on @entity2 's computer in @entity6
solitary confinement @entity2 was arrested in @entity6 on may 27 , 2010 , and then transferred to @entity307 before being returned to the @entity9 two months later
he was formally charged on july 6 , 2010 , with violations of the @entity309 and the @entity55
in march 2011 , the military revised the alleged violations and filed 22 charges against @entity2
he was held for months by the military in solitary confinement , a move that drew sharp criticism from @entity317 and other human rights groups
it even cost @entity320 his job as @entity38 spokesman after he said in march 2011 that the conditions of the soldier 's detention were " ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid
" @entity320 resigned just days later amid reports that the @entity328 administration was furious over his suggestion that @entity2 was being treated badly
president @entity328 publicly defended the conditions of the soldier 's detention , telling reporters that he had been assured by the @entity109 that the conditions were appropriate and met basic standards
even so , the outcry grew , with academics , medical professionals and others weighing in as @entity2 's attorney filed motions to move the soldier from the @entity342 prison at @entity343
after 11 months in solitary confinement , @entity2 was transferred to @entity345
he has since been moved to a jail at @entity62
dueling portraits during closing statements last week , attorneys on both sides pointed to a picture of a smiling @entity2
each had their own take on the man in the cross-dressing image that was taken in 2010 while he was on leave -- just weeks before his arrest
" this is a gleeful , grinning @entity1
manning , " who had little regard for his allegiance to the @entity9 , @entity76 told the court
but @entity80 told the judge that picture showed a situation in which @entity2 could " be himself
" the only question now is what portrait of @entity2 the judge will offer with a verdict
@entity0 's @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 and @entity374 contributed to this report .
