-- since 1995 the @entity2 shoe manufacturer @entity1 has worked hard to ensure consumers are spared the inconvenience and embarrassment of sweaty feet
its patented " breathable shoe " technology -- a combination of a membrane insole that absorbs sweat and lets it out through an outer sole filled with holes -- has turned the company into a multi-million dollar shoe empire
the idea of a sole filled with holes came to the company 's founder , @entity17 , when he was on a business trip to @entity20 , @entity21 , to promote his family 's wine products
after the meeting @entity17 decided to go for a wander in the hot @entity26 , and necessity turned out to be the mother of invention
as his feat quickly began to overheat @entity17 decided to make holes in the bottom of his shoes
" with my pocket knife i cut holes in the right and left part of the soles and i realized the ventilation in my shoes , " he said
when @entity17 returned to @entity2 he started to develop a shoe with holes in the sole that let air in and perspiration out
the design was patented and in 1995 @entity1 was founded with five employees ; today it employs 30,000 people around the world
scientific and technological innovation has been key to @entity1 's success , and the company has patented numerous new materials in rubber , leather and fabric
each prototype is designed in @entity2 but to shorten delivery times the company outsources much of its manufacturing to @entity59
" we invest a lot in quality control
in every factory where we produce there is an @entity2 technician , a shoemaker , that controls shoe by shoe , " said @entity17
despite being @entity2 's number one shoe brand , the economic crisis has affected sales in @entity1 's core market
the company 's distribution network is clogged up with last year 's stock and orders for next season are down

nearly seven years after @entity1 opened a megastore on @entity94 in @entity95 , the company is looking east to expand its empire
" our program now is to open 300 @entity1 stores in @entity79 , " he added .
