@entity0 , @entity1 -- former presidents of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity1 called wednesday for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics on the war on drugs , a @entity14 news agency said
people march in support of legalized marijuana in late january in @entity18 , northern @entity1
ex-presidents @entity22 of @entity4 , @entity23 of @entity5 and @entity24 of @entity1 made their announcement at a meeting in @entity1 of the @entity27 on @entity28 , the @entity20 news agency said
" the problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results , " @entity23 said at a news conference in which the commission 's recommendations were presented
the 17 - member panel worked on the report for a year and will forward it to all @entity41 governments as well as the @entity42 and the @entity43 , @entity20 said
@entity23 said the time is right to start a debate on the subject , particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of president @entity49 in the @entity42
" in many states in the @entity42 , as is the case in @entity52 , they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes
and in @entity59 there 's some consensus that the current policy is failing , " @entity20 quotes @entity23 as saying
decriminalization should be accompanied by treatment for addicts and public service campaigns on abuse prevention , the commission said
" if you do n't help those who are dependent , you are half way there because they are going to commit crime to get money and pay for the drug , " @entity23 said
@entity24 said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because " you have to start somewhere " and it would have been unrealistic to ask the same for all drugs , @entity20 said
marijuana was chosen because it is grown in all countries in the region and because it is " less harmful
" the decades - old criminalization of personal consumption has failed to stop the plant 's cultivation and distribution , the group said
the commission urged that all current criminal prosecution be aimed at drug cartels and organized crime and not marijuana smokers , @entity20 said
@entity22 did not attend the news conference but worked on the report , @entity24 said
wednesday 's recommendation was the second time in less than a week that a @entity41 government official called for decriminalization
a mayor in @entity100 suggested friday that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry
@entity105 , the mayor of the @entity107 district in @entity108 , said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but does n't say where to acquire them , the @entity100 21 newspaper reported in a front - page story headlined " say yes to drugs ? " @entity105 said he will take the matter up with the nation 's executive branch
@entity22 served as president of @entity4 from 1994 - 2000
@entity23 was president of @entity5 from 1990 - 94
and @entity24 led @entity1 from 1995 - 2002 .
