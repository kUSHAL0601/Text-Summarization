-- for the third year in a row , the @entity1 has been named the best overall diet by @entity4
each year , the publication asks experts to rank more than 25 diet plans to help consumers make informed decisions about nutrition
" to be top - rated , a diet had to be relatively easy to follow , nutritious , safe and effective for weight loss and against diabetes and heart disease , " according to @entity4
@entity1 , or @entity15 , was developed by the @entity16 for people with high blood pressure
but it is also effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing your risk for heart disease , stroke , kidney stones and diabetes , its website states
unlike many diet plans , @entity1 does n't cut out or extremely restrict certain foods
its focus is on limiting your daily sodium intake
the meal plan has three whole - grain products each day , four to six servings of vegetables , four to six servings of fruit , two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts / seeds / legumes
" it certainly looked like an all - star to our panel of experts , " @entity4 wrote
" though obscure , it beat out a field full of better - known diets
" following @entity1 on the list was the @entity53 ( @entity51 ) diet , which also was created by the @entity16
next in line were the @entity55 , the @entity56 and @entity57 -- all tied for third place
@entity4 also published several other lists , including best weight - loss diets , best diabetes diets , best commercial diet plans and easiest diets to follow
@entity57 topped best weight - loss , best commercial diet plan and easiest to follow lists
also high on several lists were the @entity69 plan and " @entity71 " plan
