@entity0 , @entity1 -- opposition fighters continued to push west , entering territory loyal to @entity1 leader @entity6 , but were quickly beaten back , rebels told @entity2 , as diplomats arrived tuesday in @entity8 to discuss the crisis
the setback for the rebels highlights the tenuous nature of their recent gains and suggests they might face more resistance in the days to come
as they moved into @entity17 -- near @entity18 , @entity6 's birthplace -- rebels began searching homes and found that @entity6 's forces had armed residents in the area , they said
as they were talking to residents , asking them to join the opposition , gunfire broke out
rebels told @entity2 they refused to fire back and began a hasty retreat
a stream of vehicles could be seen fleeing the area
@entity2 could not independently confirm details of the report
earlier , a wounded rebel with bandages on the left side of his head and face described what happened monday about 30 kilometers ( nearly 20 miles ) from @entity18 , near the city 's main entrance
he said he and a group of fellow opposition fighters came across a group of @entity6 forces who raised a white flag -- a suggestion that they would not shoot
but as the opposition approached the group , @entity6 forces fired on them indiscriminately , killing some of the opposition members and wounding others , the rebel told @entity2 's @entity53
vehicles were destroyed as well , he said
rebels credited coalition airstrikes with helping them regain ground , noting that they had encountered little resistance as they headed west over the weekend
but they said monday that they need more airstrikes to advance further
coalition officials say they are enforcing a @entity62 resolution approved on march 17 that creates a no - fly zone above @entity1 and mandates the protection of civilians
taking @entity18 would be a symbolic victory for the rebels , who regained control of several significant towns over the weekend as coalition airstrikes continued
rebels said the fight to take over @entity18 could be their toughest and bloodiest battle yet
opposition forces claimed to have gained control of the town of @entity77 on sunday
the opposition also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of @entity81
those victories marked a comeback for the ragtag group of amateur soldiers who are unified by one mission : toppling @entity6 's nearly 42 - year rule
on monday , opposition troops and @entity6 's security forces battled over the town of @entity91
rebel forces told @entity2 they had gained control of the city
@entity2 could hear explosions and see plumes of smoke in the area of @entity91 and @entity18
in @entity100 , where rebel fighters have said they have been under siege for weeks , @entity2 's @entity99 saw evidence of heavy fighting and damage monday when the government organized a trip for reporters to the city
government forces said they were in control of @entity100 , though they did not allow @entity99 and others into the city center , which rebels have said they control
meanwhile , diplomats from around the world began arriving in @entity8 tuesday for a conference on the crisis in @entity1
more than 40 foreign ministers , representatives from regional groups and top diplomats are expected to attend , including @entity62 @entity121 ban ki - moon , @entity123 prime minister @entity122 , @entity125 @entity124 and @entity127 secretary of state @entity126
@entity127 president @entity128 delivered a speech about @entity1 monday , making his case for military intervention amid tough calls for him to clarify the @entity127 ' role in the @entity62 - authorized military mission
he stressed the @entity127 has a strategic interest in stopping the @entity1 leader , and said " history is not on @entity6 's side
" despite the pressure for more international action , @entity140 foreign minister @entity139 complained monday that the coalition 's actions seemed to expand beyond the @entity62 resolution 's scope
" there are reports -- which go undenied -- that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on @entity6 's troops and support the military actions of rebels
there is an obvious controversy there , " he told reporters in @entity157
" we believe that the interference into what is , essentially , an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the @entity62 resolution
" @entity140 abstained from voting on the @entity62 resolution but did not veto it
@entity1 government officials have also argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to @entity6
" the rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them
and no one is even talking to them or saying , ' where are you going ? ' or ' why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the @entity1 army and @entity1 cities ? ' " @entity177 , a @entity1 government spokesman , told reporters in @entity179
he accused @entity180 of " starving the @entity1 population to get @entity1 on its knees to beg for mercy
" " they are trying to weaken our spirits
they are not trying to protect civilians , " he said
@entity180 , which has 28 member countries , formally approved plans sunday to take control of enforcing the @entity62 resolution
the coalition enforcing the resolution has been led by the @entity127 , the @entity123 and @entity195
" our mandate is very clear
we 're there to protect civilians against attacks
no more , no less , " @entity180 secretary - general @entity201 told @entity2
@entity201 said military commanders will make decisions on day - to - day operations within the framework @entity180 members agreed upon over the weekend
he declined to discuss specific rules of engagement , but stressed that @entity180 also is enforcing an arms embargo in @entity1
" we are not in @entity1 to arm people , but to protect people , " he said
on monday , @entity1 state television displayed images of injured people in a hospital and destroyed buildings as it reported that civilians were wounded when bombs struck the central @entity1 city of @entity219 in the early morning hours
@entity2 was unable to independently verify that report
@entity127 navy vice adm. @entity221 said at the @entity222 monday that there have been no confirmed civilian casualties in @entity1 as a result of coalition activity
also monday , video footage emerged online purporting to show forces loyal to @entity6 abusing prisoners
@entity2 was not able to confirm the authenticity of the video or determine exactly when and where it was shot
in the clip , soldiers are seen taunting and slapping prisoners , who are crouched in the back of a truck with their hands bound
@entity239 announced monday that it would recognize the @entity240 , composed of opposition representatives , as the sole legitimate representative of the @entity1 people
@entity2 's @entity244 , @entity53 , @entity99 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report
