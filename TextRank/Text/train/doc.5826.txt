is the president doing a good job handling the @entity3 crisis ? that 's one question the @entity7 senator running for reelection in @entity9 said is hard to answer
when faced with the question , sen. @entity10 could n't come up with an answer because , well , " it 's hard to know
" " @entity14 ... i would say that ... it 's hard to know , uh , because i have n't heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details -- i mean , i read the paper and all , but , " @entity10 said in an interview that aired tuesday on @entity22
@entity10 , who is locked in a tight contest this fall , said he is of course aware of the efforts by the @entity27 to contain the virus and the efforts of medical and engineering professionals fighting @entity3 in @entity31
so what gives ? has @entity33 done enough ? " umm ... again i 'd have to see the latest numbers , " @entity10 said
@entity10 's nonresponse comes just over a month after he attacked his opponent , rep. @entity36 , in an august ad that gave the @entity3 crisis a starring role
after rolling news clips about the crisis , the ad claims @entity36 " voted against preparing @entity41 for pandemics like @entity3 " and " cut billions from our nation 's medical disaster and emergency programs
" @entity10 's hesitation on judging @entity33 falls in a state where support for the president could hurt any @entity7 candidate , as just 33 % of @entity52 approve of the president 's job performance overall
no poll has shown what @entity52 think of @entity33 's handling of the @entity3 crisis
but maybe @entity10 will get some sympathy from voters
they have n't made up their mind yet on whether to give him another term
a @entity65 / @entity64 poll last month showed the race a dead heat , with @entity36 holding a 2 - point advantage that did n't break the margin of error .
