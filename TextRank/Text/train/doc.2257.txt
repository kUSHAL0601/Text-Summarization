@entity1 sought shelter in this small , ethnically - mixed market town populated by @entity24 , @entity6 and @entity64
the town was built along train tracks that divide the border between @entity1 and @entity11
on november 8 , @entity1 rebels mounted an assault on @entity18

the flood of refugees increased in the following days when @entity1 helicopters and jets began bombing @entity18 @entity18 , spreading fear throughout the neighboring @entity11 town of @entity88
a team of @entity91 journalists visited @entity18 last friday during a lull in the regime airstrikes
by then , the town 's central bazaar district was in ruins and almost deserted , except for roving bands of rebel fighters
a few shopkeepers were seen hurriedly emptying their businesses of all merchandise , clearly afraid there would be more fighting
there were no victory scenes of jubilation among locals
some refugees told @entity91 they were unhappy with the arrival of @entity41 rebels
that was echoed by a @entity6 umbrella group , which issued a public statement demanding that all armed groups evacuate @entity18 @entity18
" most of the @entity6 want neither the rebels nor the regime , " said @entity115 , a @entity6 farmer who had fled to neighboring @entity11 , in an interview last week with @entity91
tensions between the predominantly @entity24 rebels and members of the militia affiliated with the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) erupted monday
however , @entity24 and @entity6 offered contradictory accounts of how the fighting began
spokesmen for the rebels claimed their fighters came under attack when they approached a @entity6 checkpoint unarmed
@entity6 activists said snipers opened fire on a demonstration organized to demand the withdrawal of @entity41 fighters
" the reason why they organized the demonstration was to bring the refugees back to @entity18 and to tell the @entity41 to leave the town , " said @entity138 , a female @entity6 activist and @entity18 resident , in a phone call with @entity91
" this was a safe area before the @entity41 came to @entity18
" the deadly ethnic clashes appeared to have embarrassed prominent officials in the @entity1 opposition movement
" i have been trying to organize talks between the @entity6 and the @entity41 since yesterday , " said @entity150 , a spokesman for the @entity41 based in @entity11
" it was wrong for the @entity41 to enter @entity6 areas like @entity18 , " he added
" the @entity6 do n't think the way we think
they have another culture , another ideology ... this is exactly what the regime wants , to create problems between the @entity24 and the @entity6 so that we stop struggling to bring down the regime
" monday 's battle in @entity18 marked the second time in less than a month that anti-regime rebels have clashed with @entity6 militia members
on october 27 , at least 21 people were killed and more than 100 kidnapped after @entity6 gunmen linked to the @entity124 fought @entity41 rebels in the battleground city of @entity171 , in northern @entity1
both factions have since reportedly worked out a cease - fire agreement .
