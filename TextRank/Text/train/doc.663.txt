-- most @entity1 in several key @entity3 and @entity4 countries hold negative views of the terrorist network @entity6 a year after @entity8 forces killed its leader , @entity9 , according to a recent survey
the poll by the @entity13 's @entity12 , released monday , found that a high proportion -- between 71 % and 98 % -- of @entity1 questioned in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 viewed @entity6 in an unfavorable way
in @entity20 , where @entity21 killed the @entity6 leader during a raid on a compound a year ago , 55 % of the @entity1 surveyed had a negative opinion of the terrorist group , according to the poll
only 13 % had a favorable view
the @entity8 has used controversial drone strikes in tribal areas of @entity20 to try to dismantle @entity6 's infrastructure
in may 2011 , an elite team of @entity21 flew two helicopters into @entity33 , @entity20 , where @entity9 was living in a three - story compound with approximately two dozen people , including his wives and children
the killing of @entity9 in that raid prompted an uproar in @entity20
the blatant violation of the country 's national sovereignty embarrassed the civilian government and especially the military , which has a prestigious military academy in @entity33
the drone strikes , the @entity9 raid and airstrikes by @entity51 forces in november that killed two dozen @entity20 soldiers near the border with @entity54 have soured relations between @entity56 and @entity57
but they do not appear to have created a high level of support for @entity6 in @entity20 , according to the @entity13 survey
interfaith activist @entity62 concurred , saying his organization uncovered nuanced feelings in @entity20 about the killing of @entity9
" they were unhappy about the way the killing had taken place , but there was no sense they were angry he had been assassinated , " he said his @entity67 - based @entity66 found two days after the killing
and with the passing of time , support for @entity6 has fallen further in key parts of @entity20 , he said
" as more and more information comes out and more and more attacks take place , the population has gotten fed up with @entity6 's tactics , " said @entity62
" because of the actions of @entity6 specifically in the @entity54 - @entity20 border region , they have managed to turn off a lot of people in @entity20 , " he said of the terror network
" they are not interested in seeing @entity9 as some great martyr , feeling : ' we are unhappy with the @entity8 , but we are not going to grieve over @entity9 , ' " he said
sympathy for the terrorist group appears to be stronger in @entity15 , the poll 's findings suggest
twenty - one percent of the @entity1 questioned there had a favorable view of @entity6 , while 71 % had an unfavorable one
the second highest level of positive opinions of the terrorist network among the countries surveyed was found in @entity16 , where 15 % viewed @entity6 favorably and 77 % viewed it unfavorably
muslims polled in @entity17 and @entity18 were much less likely to see the extremist organization in a positive light
only 6 % in @entity17 and 2 % in @entity18 viewed it favorably
in @entity18 , 98 % of those questioned held a negative opinion of @entity6
the number in @entity17 was 73 %
the survey 's results were based on face - to - face interviews with 1,000 adults each in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 between march 19 and april 10
in @entity17 , 1,001 adults were surveyed in person between march 20 and april 11
a total of 1,206 adults were interviewed face - to - face in @entity20 between march 28 and april 13
the @entity13 noted that the question about views toward @entity6 was asked at a later point in the interview in @entity20 than in the other four countries .
