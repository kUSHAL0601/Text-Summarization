-- @entity1 in the @entity2 are giving no credence to those looking for a real scandal over a lewd picture that appeared on the @entity8 account of @entity10 congressman @entity9
@entity12 's @entity11 , the @entity2 minority leader , stuck to her party 's main legislative focus thursday -- " @entity15 , @entity15 , @entity15
" when questioned as to whether the situation was turning into a distraction , @entity11 replied " that 's your problem
if that 's what 's important to you , then that 's what you 'll report
that 's not what 's important to us
" @entity9 has insisted that he did not post the photo , which shows the lower body of a man wearing underwear
the image appeared briefly on the @entity10 representative 's @entity8 account friday night
@entity9 says he does n't know where the picture came from and he believes his account was hacked as a prank
he told reporters wednesday that he has hired a private firm to investigate
@entity9 told @entity0 thursday that he intends to " get back to work doing the job that i 'm paid to do
" @entity2 minority whip @entity43 , @entity44 , said he wanted to go over the facts before offering comments
he said it was a serious issue , and that it is important to maintain privacy
on the other side of the spectrum , @entity52 , who recently considered a presidential run , weighed in on the issue
he told @entity0 's @entity55 that @entity9 is either " incompetent " or " lying
" the conservative blogger who broke the story has been calling for a full investigation of what he describes as either the hacking of a congressman 's account or something @entity9 wants to hide
@entity64 runs the conservative website biggovernment.com , which first reported the photo on @entity9 's @entity8 account
he has told @entity0 that the case warrants further inquiry by the @entity70 and @entity71
it was @entity64 who posted the heavily edited and incomplete video of a speech by @entity77 employee @entity76 last year
the version he placed online suggested that she refused to offer her full help to a white farmer and @entity76 was forced to resign
a full version of the speech showed that @entity76 had assisted the farmer , who later came forward and credited @entity76 with helping save his farm
@entity76 has since filed a civil suit , accusing @entity64 of defamation , false light and infliction of emotional distress , according to a statement issued by the law firm representing her
@entity93 is also named as a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by the @entity96 , or @entity96 , over secretly recorded videos that proved deeply embarrassing to the agency
the video shows two conservative activists , posing as a pimp and prostitute , seeking advice from @entity96 workers on setting up a brothel
the videos , which were posted on @entity64 's website , prompted a groundswell of action against the organization , including a limited investigation by the @entity112 @entity111 and a slashing of funds from the federal government and several states .
