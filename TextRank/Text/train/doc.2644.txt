-- the @entity2 's sanctions will devastate @entity4 football for years to come
they will also harm the university as a whole , with consequences felt not only in the athletic and budget departments , but probably in the development and admissions offices , too
the severe penalties are probably appropriate , but i question whether the @entity2 overstepped its legal authority in issuing them so hastily
@entity4 acknowledges institutional responsibility by accepting the sanctions without a legal fight
it can try to repair the institutional flaws that enabled @entity21 to rape children and allowed a coverup of those crimes , but it misses a historic opportunity to legally challenge the scope of @entity2 authority and how it 's applied
news : ' @entity30 wake - up call ' for @entity4 the @entity2 is in the business of ensuring that college sports are separate from professional sports and that they keep within the academic mission of its members
@entity4 supporters have reason to insist that the @entity2 lacks the jurisdiction to punish its members for off - field , nonplayer related crimes
after all , what do @entity21 's crimes , however heinous , and the associated coverup , however despicable , really have to do with the @entity2 's purpose ? the @entity2 's constitution , which all members must follow , requires that the coaches and athletic officials display ethical conduct
a football coach raping children and the head coach and athletic officials covering it up clearly constitutes unethical behavior
news : paterno loyalists call @entity2 sanctions excessive the @entity2 also knows that if the @entity4 scandal been unveiled years ago , not only would some boys have avoided the horror of @entity21 , the football team probably would have faced @entity2 sanctions
on balance , the @entity2 had grounds to sanction @entity4
the heinous acts warranted a stiff penalty
but i 'm less comfortable with how fast the ruling was made
the @entity2 clearly bypassed its normal procedure for investigating and sanctioning
this procedure often takes more than a year and involves several hearings
consider what the @entity2 did not give @entity4
normally the association notifies the school that an official inquiry is going to be held
notice is followed by an investigation and , if the @entity2 finds fault , a written explanation of the allegations is given
the school has 90 days to respond , after which it may request more time to respond or schedule a hearing before the @entity2 's @entity85 on infractions
experts : what happens to @entity4 football now ? then comes the hearing , which resembles a trial or arbitration hearing
if the school is found to be at fault , it can appeal to the @entity2 's @entity85
@entity4 did not receive 90 days to respond , nor did it get a trial or an opportunity to appeal
to bolster that its decision - making process makes sense , the @entity2 could maintain that @entity4 president @entity100 's decision to sign a consent agreement takes any potential challenge off the table
besides , the @entity105 @entity104 , in @entity2 v. @entity106 , made clear the association is not a governmental actor and thus is not obligated to provide due process
although the absence of due process does not mean the @entity2 can act arbitrarily and capriciously , it does provide it with significant immunity from lawsuits
the @entity2 could also assert that @entity4 's own @entity115 treated the school fairly in finding university officials covering up @entity21 's crimes
in addition , the @entity2 could insist that @entity4 is voluntarily a member and has contractually consented to @entity2 authority
last , the @entity2 could emphasize that the extraordinary circumstances of @entity4 compelled instant action
if the @entity2 had waited until next year , @entity4 would have played the 2012 season under a cloud of suspicion
news : do sanctions alter history books on @entity4 and @entity130 's legacy ? but does the @entity2 's swift justice mean it will now regularly bypass its normal infractions process when it penalizes other schools ? will " swift justice " become the norm ? probably not , because the @entity4 scandal is unique on many levels , including that the @entity2 could rely on an extensive internal report commissioned by the university itself
few schools could afford to commission such an internal report ; even fewer would choose to do so
i imagine the @entity2 would probably prefer to employ its more deliberate and transparent process as often as possible
a respected process helps to legitimatize @entity2 penalties
if @entity2 members were routinely subject to swift justice , they may seek alternatives to the @entity2 for organizing games
still , longstanding criticisms of the how the @entity2 does business will only become louder because of today 's news
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .
