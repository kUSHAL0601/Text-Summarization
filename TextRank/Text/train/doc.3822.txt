-- a mortar landed near the @entity2 embassy in the @entity6 capital of @entity7 on thursday , killing a @entity6 civilian and injuring nine @entity6 security personnel who work for the diplomatic post , @entity2 's foreign ministry said
no @entity2 were hurt in the attack , according to the ministry , which said it was trying to determine who launched the shell
the @entity15 condemned the shelling
" the @entity15 continues to emphasize that those responsible for atrocities on all sides must be held accountable , " @entity18 spokeswoman @entity17 said in a statement
the death was one of dozens reported thursday throughout @entity6 , plagued by civil war
state - run media reported that the regime 's army recaptured the city of @entity31 from opposition militants on thursday
the army killed an unspecified number of militants who earlier this month had taken the city , about 50 miles northeast of @entity7 , the state - run @entity33 reported
the opposition group @entity39 reported at least 55 people were killed thursday , including 20 in @entity7 and its suburbs and 10 in @entity42
@entity42 , in northern @entity6 , is where a regime - fired scud missile hit a market a day earlier , killing about 35 people and wounding dozens of others , according to the main opposition umbrella group , the @entity49
the @entity6 conflict began in march 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the @entity54 movement
it is now a full - blown civil war
the @entity57 estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , and 9 million have been displaced
@entity6 plans to send a delegation to @entity60 early next year to participate in peace talks , but the opposition @entity62 says it will pass
the @entity57 announced that the often - delayed @entity64 conference aimed at ending the @entity6 civil war starts january 22 in @entity64
@entity64 is a successor to @entity67 , a june 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan for @entity6 that calls for a transitional governing body
it left open the question of whether president @entity75 must leave power
the @entity15 and @entity2 announced in may that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in @entity64 to implement the plan
but the second @entity64 conference has been delayed several times .
