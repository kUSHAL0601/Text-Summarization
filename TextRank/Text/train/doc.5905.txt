-- the civil warfare and social instability in @entity5 have prompted the flight of more than 50,000 refugees to neighboring @entity8 this year alone , the @entity2 refugee agency said friday
the @entity10 refugee complex is the largest of its kind in the world
@entity5 are arriving at an average rate of 6,400 a month , and their presence has placed pressure on northern @entity8 's @entity10 refugee complex -- bursting at the seams with three times the population it was built to hold
there are more than 281,000 @entity5 refugees there , and the @entity23 fears that heavy rains in @entity8 will lead to flooding at the complex and pose " considerable health risks to the refugees
" the @entity29 has been working with the @entity23 , @entity8 authorities and non-governmental organizations to relocate refugees from @entity10 to the @entity34 camp in the northwestern part of the country
@entity5 has been in turmoil for years
clashes have raged between pro-government forces and rebel groups such as @entity41 , the @entity42 militia with ties to @entity44
and this fighting has prompted widespread displacement in the war - wracked nation
@entity41 has been targeting the most prominent @entity50 - linked entity in the capital , @entity52 -- the @entity54 peacekeeping mission , the de facto military force of the weak , transitional @entity5 government
fighting has forced about 250,000 @entity5 out of their homes in @entity52 since may and many of the displaced have sought refuge west of the capital in the @entity62 corridor , the @entity2 agency said
also , many @entity5 have chosen to flee the country by traveling across the @entity64 and the @entity65 to @entity66 or the @entity67 to @entity68
many have drowned or have gone missing in their journey .
