thousands of @entity1 protesters hurled bottles and eggs outside the @entity5 embassy in @entity6 over the weekend amid growing tensions between the two nations over a group of disputed islands
waving @entity1 national flags and holding portraits of the late chairman @entity14 , the mostly young protesters chanted " down with @entity5 imperialism " and called for war as they made their way down the streets under the watchful eyes of police and guards
elsewhere in @entity1 , anti-japanese rallies broke out in dozens of cities and sometimes turned violent
messages and photos posted on @entity1 social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking @entity5 stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of @entity5 make
@entity5 media also reported incidents of assault on @entity5 nationals in @entity1 in the past few days
a @entity1 foreign ministry spokesman insisted friday that the public anger was not aimed at the @entity5 people , whose safety would be protected in @entity1 according to law
authorities rarely permit protests in @entity1 , prompting suspicion that saturday 's nationwide rallies were government - sanctioned
in @entity6 , police walking along the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street
by saturday night , @entity1 's state - run media had started appealing for restraint , running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the true meaning of patriotism
in a sign of rising concern over the gathering of large crowds , authorities in cities that had seen the most ferocious protests canceled entertainment and sporting events
@entity67 islands dispute : who claims what ? tensions escalated friday when @entity1 maritime surveillance ships ignored warnings from @entity5 and briefly entered waters around the group of islands at the center of the heated territorial dispute
the ships arrived near the uninhabited islands -- which @entity5 calls @entity81 and @entity1 calls @entity81 -- and began patrols and " law enforcement , " @entity1 's state - run news agency @entity78 reported
economic consequences of island spat the islands , situated in the @entity87 between @entity88 and @entity89 , are under @entity5 control , but @entity1 claims they have been a part of its territory for ages
the long - running argument over who has sovereignty has triggered protests in both nations
the @entity99 , a key ally of @entity5 , has repeatedly urged @entity100 and @entity6 to resolve the dispute through dialogue
@entity99 defense secretary @entity104 will meet with his counterparts in @entity5 and @entity1 this weekend , the @entity103 said thursday
@entity1 vessels had all left the waters by friday afternoon and headed north , the @entity106 said
@entity5 said it will intensify patrols of the area
the controversial @entity1 move to begin patrols around the islands follows @entity5 's purchase of several of the islands from a private owner this week
@entity1 described the deal as " illegal and invalid
" animosity between the two countries over the islands runs deep
they have come to represent what many @entity1 see as unfinished business : redressing the impact of the @entity5 occupation of large swathes of eastern @entity1 during the 1930s and 1940s
@entity1 says its claim goes back hundreds of years
@entity5 says it saw no trace of @entity1 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity5 sovereign territory in 1895
@entity5 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers
the @entity5 surrender at the end of @entity139 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further
the islands were administered by the @entity99 occupation force after the war
but in 1972 , @entity144 returned them to @entity5 as part of its withdrawal from @entity88 .
