@entity0 -- president @entity2 on thursday placed the @entity3 squarely on the side of democratic reform in the @entity6 and @entity7 , declaring in a major policy speech that the wave of change sweeping the region " can not be denied
" addressing a global audience , @entity2 condemned the use of force against @entity16 protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike
he also said the eruption of demands for greater opportunity in @entity23 nations could be used to kick - start stalled @entity27 - @entity26 peace talks
at the same time , @entity2 applied his own pressure by declaring as policy the long - held idea that a future @entity26 state should be based on borders that existed before the 1967 @entity6 war
in the past , the @entity3 has unofficially supported a two - state solution to the @entity27 - @entity26 conflict based on the borders in place prior to the war 44 years ago in which @entity27 seized the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
@entity2 became the first president to formally endorse the policy , but he acknowledged the need for modifications through the negotiating process due to conditions on the ground
@entity2 also dismissed the notion of @entity52 - style extremism appealing to future generations of @entity54 , asserting that the organization was " losing its struggle for relevance " long before the killing of @entity60 on may 2
the president 's speech -- the subject of intense speculation in recent days -- was a long - promised overview of @entity3 's changing @entity6 policy in the wake of the @entity16 that started unfolding in @entity68 last december
in recent months , @entity0 has often appeared to struggle to keep up with the pace of events not only in @entity68 , but also in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , and elsewhere
administration officials have also wrestled with an @entity23 suspicion of @entity3 motives fueled by decades of @entity3 support for the region 's autocratic regimes
" shouts of human dignity are being heard across the region , " @entity2 declared , speaking in front of a group of diplomatic and military officials at the @entity85
" we support political and economic reform in the @entity6 and @entity7 that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region
" the president acknowledged that " there will be times " when @entity3 's " short - term interests do not align perfectly with our long - term vision
" " but we can -- and will -- speak out for a set of core principles " including freedom of religion and expression , and equality under the law , he promised
" it will be years before this story reaches its end , " @entity2 said
but " the events of the past six months show us that strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore
" among other things , @entity2 accused @entity115 of hypocrisy for publicly supporting protests in parts of the @entity23 world after violently cracking down on protests at home
he blasted the @entity73 regime for reacting to dissent by choosing " the path of murder and the mass arrests
" " the @entity73 people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy , " @entity2 said
president @entity133 " now has a choice : he can lead that transition , or get out of the way
" on wednesday , @entity2 imposed new sanctions against @entity133 and other top officials in @entity136
@entity2 also criticized the crackdown against @entity139 protesters in @entity75 -- a key @entity141 ally and home of the @entity144 's @entity143
the president made no mention of struggles for greater rights in neighboring @entity149 , another close ally
a large portion of the president 's speech was devoted to the @entity27 - @entity26 conflict
the administration 's strategy for a comprehensive settlement has been seemingly derailed in recent months
former sen. @entity158 unexpectedly submitted his resignation as the president 's @entity6 envoy friday , and deadly clashes broke out sunday between @entity164 protesters and @entity27 forces
ongoing @entity27 settlement construction in the @entity39 and @entity26 steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart since @entity2 took office
additional doubts about the viability of the stalled peace process were raised this month in the wake of a formal reconciliation agreement between the two largest @entity26 factions : president @entity179 ' party , the @entity39 - based @entity180 ; and the @entity182 group @entity181 , which rules @entity40
both @entity27 and the @entity3 consider @entity181 a terrorist organization and have voiced strong opposition to the inclusion of the group in any unity government , demanding that it first renounce violence , recognize the state of @entity27 and abide by all previous agreements
nevertheless , the president renewed his push for a two - state solution thursday , declaring that the borders of @entity27 and a future @entity26 state should be based on pre- 1967 lines " with mutually agreed swaps , so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states
" " the full and phased withdrawal " of @entity27 security forces from the @entity39 has to be accompanied by evidence of a @entity26 state that can help secure the peace and prevent attacks against @entity27 , he said
but a continued @entity27 presence in the @entity39 is inconsistent with long - term dreams of a secure @entity209 and democratic state , @entity2 said
" the @entity26 people must have the right to govern themselves , and reach their potential , in a sovereign and contiguous state , " the president said
neither the @entity26 nor the @entity27 offered a warm response to @entity2 's speech
@entity181 called @entity2 's remarks " empty of concrete significance " and promised not to recognize " the @entity27 occupation
" @entity27 prime minister @entity221 's office stated that @entity0 should stand by previous @entity3 commitments relating " to @entity27 not having to withdraw to the 1967 lines , which are both indefensible and which would leave major @entity27 population centers ... beyond those lines
" on a broader regional level , @entity2 stressed the importance of economic development to accompany political reforms
toward that end , he announced $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for @entity71 , as well as another $ 1 billion in loan guarantees for @entity233
he also promised a new " comprehensive " trade and investment partnership initiative with the @entity6 and @entity7
@entity236 will play a key role in moving the initiative forward , he said
@entity2 also defended @entity3 and @entity240 intervention in @entity72 , arguing the move was necessary to prevent an imminent massacre
" @entity243 is working against ( @entity72 leader @entity245 ) @entity244 , " he asserted
when @entity244 goes , " decades of provocation will come to an end " and a democratic transition can begin , he said
thursday 's speech came nearly two years after @entity2 delivered an address in @entity233 , the @entity71 capital , that called for " a new beginning " between the @entity3 and the @entity253 world
today , many in the @entity6 and @entity7 consider the @entity233 speech a collection of lofty ideals that lacked sufficient follow - through , and they have been looking for @entity2 to signal substantive and concrete policies that support the aspirations of the region 's people
@entity263 , a former @entity264 foreign minister and longtime advocate of @entity23 reform , said wednesday that the @entity6 is a new environment now , where young men and women are laying their lives on the line for democracy throughout the region
they need to be told their cause is just and how the @entity3 will support them
if thursday 's address is viewed as just " another @entity233 speech , forget it , " said @entity263 , now at the @entity280
" it was great two years ago , and even then the feedback was mixed , because people wanted to see what he would do
if he does n't have much to add this time , people will not be fooled by it
" @entity289 , a 24 - year - old @entity71 activist and blogger , predicted @entity2 's words will have little impact in her country
" at this point , whatever president @entity2 will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we 're really building democracy from the bottom up , " @entity294 told @entity1 , adding that " @entity3 is not the model of democracy that we are striving for
" she called @entity3 policy on the @entity6 " hypocritical " because , she said , the @entity3 " will support a dictatorship if it 's aligned with its interests
" that attitude is still rife throughout the @entity6 and @entity7 , noted @entity1 senior political analyst @entity309
with @entity71 facing economic crisis , the @entity72 conflict at a stalemate , an ongoing harsh crackdown on demonstrators in @entity73 and the @entity27 - @entity26 peace process at a standstill , there is little belief in the region that @entity2 or the @entity3 can do much to help , @entity309 said
" i think it 's going to be very difficult in the near term to generate excitement about his policies in the @entity6 , " @entity309 said
@entity2 's speech came in a week when the @entity325 is strongly focused on @entity6 issues
he met tuesday with @entity264 's @entity327 at the @entity325 , and will meet friday with @entity221
@entity1 's @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this story .
