@entity0 , @entity1 -- two @entity1 destroyers and a supply ship set sail friday for the @entity7 on a mission to protect @entity1 merchant ships from an increasing number of pirate attacks occurring in the waters off @entity13 , state media reported
@entity1 has reportedly been working to rapidly modernize its fleet
the @entity16 fleet left from a port in @entity18 in the southernmost island province of @entity20 at 1:50 p.m. , according to @entity21
it marks the first time @entity1 naval vessels have left @entity1 waters in centuries
they will will join a multinational naval force already patrolling the area , including vessels from the @entity31 , @entity33 member states , @entity34 and @entity35
" this demonstrates that the @entity1 government is committed to the international community and a responsible player and a major country in the world , " rear admiral @entity36 told reporters when the mission was announced last week
the ships are carrying two helicopters and special operations forces , officials said
figures from the @entity50 for the year - to - date show pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels and hijacked nearly 40 off the coast of @entity13
the all - important @entity7 links the @entity54 and the @entity55
around 20,000 oil tankers , freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year
@entity1 's move is one of the latest reactions to piracy in the gulf
a top @entity66 official said wednesday that @entity67 was considering sending vessels to join the effort
meanwhile , @entity72 sailors on thursday foiled an attempt by pirates to hijack an @entity76 cargo ship off the coast of @entity78 , the @entity70 said
the @entity72 navy frigate @entity80 responded to an emergency call from the @entity82 thursday morning , sending helicopters to the stricken vessel
when the helicopters arrived , the pirates broke off the attack , the ministry said
a crew member on the @entity82 was wounded when the pirates attempted to board the vessel
he was flown by helicopter for treatment aboard the @entity80 , the ministry said
the @entity72 sailors captured the pirates and disarmed them , destroying the weapons , the ministry said
@entity1 's navy is considered a " brown - water fleet " -- designed to operate almost exclusively along its coast
but the country has reportedly been working to rapidly modernize its navy for the past several years
@entity1 officials have said their mission would last as long as is necessary and in accordance with @entity107 regulations
the @entity107 passed a resolution last week aimed at combating piracy along the @entity110 by allowing military forces to chase pirate onto land in cases of " hot pursuit
" the @entity107 resolution , which passed unanimously , expands upon existing counter-piracy tools , including a stipulation that would allow for national and regional military forces to chase pirates onto land -- specifically into @entity13 , where many of the pirates have their bases
among the victims of pirate attacks have been cargo ships , oil tankers and luxury yachts
at least one major company pulled its ships from the @entity7 region this year , meaning cargo bound for @entity133 had to round the @entity135 continent rather than use the @entity136 .
