@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday replaced gen. @entity3 as commander of @entity6 and allied forces in @entity7 and nominated gen. @entity8 to replace him while affirming support for a counterinsurgency strategy encountering problems
the dramatic shift came a day after @entity3 's disparaging comments about @entity6 's civilian leadership surfaced , and reignited the national debate on the war in @entity7 -- now in its eighth year with a june death toll of coalition forces that is close to becoming the highest of the war
@entity2 accepted @entity3 's resignation " with considerable regret " and named @entity8 , the head of the @entity22 , to take over pending @entity24 confirmation
" it is the right thing for our mission in @entity7 , for our military and for our country , " @entity2 said outside the @entity29 , flanked by top civilian and military leaders including vice president @entity31 ; adm. @entity34 , chairman of the @entity35 ; defense secretary @entity36 , and @entity8
@entity3 's remarks in a @entity39 article undermined the civilian control of the military " at the core of our democratic system , " @entity2 said , noting the decision to replace the general did not involve any disagreement over strategy or personal issues
" i believe that it is the right decision for our national security , " @entity2 said
" the conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general
" @entity2 said that as hard as it is to lose the general , the " war is bigger than any one man or woman
" more importantly , he said , the war requires a unified effort from civilian and military leaders , warning that he wo n't tolerate division within his team
" i believe that this mission demands unity of effort across our alliance and across my national security team , " @entity2 said
" and i do n't think that we can sustain that unity of effort and achieve our objectives in @entity7 without making this change
" the president urged the @entity24 to swiftly confirm @entity8 , who would leave his @entity22 position
@entity76 chairman @entity75 , @entity77 , later said a confirmation hearing would begin no later than tuesday , and he expected it to take one day
" we know @entity8 , " @entity75 said
" i do n't think there will be anybody who will say we need more time
" @entity3 issued a statement wednesday saying that he strongly supports @entity2 's strategy in @entity7 and is " deeply committed " to the coalition forces and the @entity7 people
" it was out of respect for this commitment -- and a desire to see the mission succeed -- that i tendered my resignation , " @entity3 's statement said
" it has been my privilege and honor to lead our nation 's finest
" a source close to @entity3 offered a description of the roughly 30 - minute meeting between @entity2 and @entity3 that led to the general 's resignation wednesday morning
@entity3 briefly explained the magazine article at the center of the controversy , took responsibility and then offered his resignation , the source said
@entity2 accepted the resignation , the source said
the president " had no intention of keeping him , " and @entity3 knew that going in , the source said
@entity3 is not returning to @entity7 , and his personal belongings will be shipped home , according to the source
immediate political reaction from both parties was positive , with lawmakers saying @entity2 had little choice in making a change and that @entity8 was the best choice for the job
@entity75 noted that @entity8 authored the counterinsurgency strategy now being followed in @entity7
the spokesman for @entity7 president @entity121 expressed disappointment at the loss of @entity3 but called @entity8 the " obvious " replacement , while statements from allied governments and @entity127 also offered support and commitment to the @entity7 mission
in the magazine article , @entity131 and his top officers are quoted making disrespectful comments about civilian officials including @entity31 , @entity6 ambassador to @entity7 @entity136 , special representative to @entity7 @entity138 and national security adviser @entity139
news of the article set off a political firestorm tuesday
@entity2 was " angry " after reading the general 's remarks , said @entity29 press secretary @entity145 , who added that @entity3 had a " profound " mistake
@entity3 apologized tuesday , but was recalled to @entity0 and met with @entity36 and @entity34 on wednesday before going to the @entity29 , @entity148 spokesman @entity147 said
after he met with @entity2 , @entity3 was not invited to participate in a separate @entity29 national security meeting on the war in @entity7 , two sources told @entity1
the reported remarks by @entity3 and his staff were strongly criticized on @entity154
three key @entity24 leaders on defense and foreign policy issues -- @entity159 sens. @entity158 of @entity160 and @entity161 of @entity162 and independent sen. @entity163 of @entity164 -- said in a news conference wednesday that @entity2 had no choice but to replace @entity3
" the statements of the general not only were outside the norm , they really did put into question military subordination of civilian control , " @entity161 said , taking particular issue with unnamed officers in the article who he said showed disrespect and a cavalier attitude he termed " unacceptable
" " this is a low point in my view for the armed forces in a very long time , and i 'm glad the president made this decision , " @entity161 said
" there are some other officers that need to be looked at , and they need to be replaced
" at the same time , the senators and others said @entity2 should now make clear that a troop withdrawal from @entity7 will only occur when conditions allow it , rather than on the july 2011 date set by the administration
@entity8 " is an outstanding military leader , but even he ca n't win in @entity7 if the president continues to insist on an arbitrary withdrawal date -- a fact our enemies are counting on and our allies fear , " said sen. @entity194 of @entity195 , the top @entity159 on the @entity196
@entity75 , @entity77 , told reporters that @entity8 supports the july 2011 date for starting a troop withdrawal based on conditions on the ground
" what will be conditions - based is not whether reductions begin in july 2011 , but the pace of those reductions , " @entity75 said @entity8 told him
@entity75 acknowledged that @entity8 or @entity2 could change their minds on the issue , saying , " nothing is etched in stone
" @entity218 chairman @entity217 , @entity219 , said in a written statement that @entity2 's " decision to return @entity222 ( @entity8 ) @entity8 to the battlefield provides not just continuity in philosophy , but tested diplomatic skill that is at the very center of a military strategy which hinges on progress in governance to sustain military gains
" @entity233 chairman @entity232 , @entity195 , said that @entity8 " is the best that we have
" " i have great confidence in his ability to bring about a successful outcome in @entity7
the commander - in - chief must have confidence in his commanders in the field , " he said
" it is time to move on and return our focus to waging the war in @entity7
" a spokesman for the @entity248 said his government would have preferred to see @entity3 stay , but was happy @entity8 had been tapped as the replacement
" we 're not happy to see gen. @entity3 go , but of all the choices that could have been made , we are happy to hear it is @entity8 who will continue the mission , " gen. @entity251 said
@entity2 tapped @entity3 to head the @entity6 military effort in @entity7 in the spring of 2009 shortly after dismissing gen. @entity259
@entity3 was strongly recommended as the best choice to carry out the counterinsurgency strategy created by @entity8 in @entity262 , but administration officials later expressed displeasure with what they thought was @entity3 's leak of his request for more troops for @entity7 before @entity2 completed his review of the issue
the president eventually ordered 30,000 additional troops to @entity7 , most of the number sought by @entity3
@entity1 's @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 contributed to this report .
