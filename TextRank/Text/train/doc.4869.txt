@entity0 -- a stampede on a university campus in @entity0 tuesday left one woman dead and several people injured , according to eyewitness reports
the victim was the mother of one of many prospective students who had gathered in the early hours to enroll in the @entity10 , according to the @entity11 , the youth wing of the governing @entity13 party
local media reported that 17 people were also injured
thousands of young people and their relatives had gathered outside the campus gates hoping to secure some of the last remaining university places or admission slots for students
some chose to sleep outside overnight , desperate to sign up
one eyewitness told @entity1 how the stampede began
" there was a girl who tried to jump over the fence but unfortunately she tripped and the fence went through her from her back area so when the police came the people saw the police van as an excuse to jump over it to use it to go over
" the first lady went over and i think that broke everything off because we were all looking at her , we never thought she would jump over
she jumped over , everybody screamed , clapped and started pushing their way through and that is when the commotion started happening
" another witness recounted how a gate was opened " and then people started fighting and running towards the gate , and then there was a stampede
people were stepping on each other , and i was also there by the gate , but i was able to survive
" sitting among the debris of shoes , @entity54 cards and blankets -- all discarded during the stampede -- june @entity59 told @entity1 how she was accompanying her grandson to the university when they also got caught up in the chaos
" so we came here very early in the morning
we found that there was a stampede
we had to run back , we could n't go in , " said @entity59 , who is retired
" after it was a bit tense and we saw a woman lying there , a dead woman
so it is a scary situation
" she told @entity1 that this was the second time she and her grandson had been waiting outside the campus trying to secure him a place
in a statement , the @entity11 called on the government " to urgently put in place measures that will remedy the situation of many prospective students and fewer admission spaces in institutions of higher learning not only in @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , but across institutions of higher learning in @entity87
" the situation is reaching crisis level , with the number of places available for higher education students now far less than the number of people qualified to take them , the statement said
the @entity11 will work with the @entity98 and education ministers to try to find a sustainable solution , it added
some experts agree that there is an education crisis in @entity87
" the crisis is one of young people who want opportunities and struggle to get them
there are not enough jobs , places at university , or alternatives like vocational colleges , nor enough money to pay for it all , " said @entity107 , visiting adjunct professor for the @entity109 at @entity110 , another @entity0 university
the country also suffers from high levels of unemployment , particularly among young people
even after the ambulances had left the scene of the stampede , hundreds of people were still lining up behind the university 's closed gates , hoping to be admitted .
