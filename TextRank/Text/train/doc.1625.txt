-- @entity3 's iconic @entity2 -- widely known as trouble in @entity6 cartoons -- has been put on the country 's endangered list , environmental officials announced friday
the @entity2 's future is threatened by a contagious facial cancer that has killed large numbers
" my decision to uplist the @entity2 is based on advice from the @entity16 , which lists the devil facial tumor disease as the major threat to the devil , " environment minister @entity12 said in a statement
" this disease has led to the decline of about 70 percent of the @entity2 population since the disease was first reported in 1996
" the disease has devastated the animals , native to the @entity3 state of @entity27 , an island off the southeastern coast
devil facial tumor disease is one of only three cancers known to spread like a contagious disease , according to the @entity2 government 's web site
as the name implies , it causes tumors on the face and neck , and sometimes other parts of the body , and it 's passed by biting
the @entity3 government has committed $ 7.8 million over five years to the @entity43 the @entity2 program , according to @entity12
" this is to help with research into disease transmission and treatment , and will support captive and wild populations , " he said
in 2005 , the program established a captive breeding insurance population
disease - free animals were gathered from the wild population and are being bred on the mainland
" as of february 2009 , the insurance population had grown to 145 disease - free @entity2 devils " at 10 zoos and wildlife parks , the @entity2 government said
" the animals in this breeding program could play an important role , if ever needed , in helping re-establish healthy wild populations in @entity27
" although the image of the @entity2 has been popularized around the world by the @entity6 cartoon character @entity67 , the real thing is a much different animal
the devil , the world 's only surviving marsupial carnivore , is about 25 pounds ( 12 kg ) of bad attitude , with a haunting cry that 's a combination of snorting and growling .
