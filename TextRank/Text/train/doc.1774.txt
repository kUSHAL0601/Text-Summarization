@entity0 -- @entity2 prepared saturday for a journey back to a place of darkness in @entity6
soon , he plans to stand again in @entity7 , @entity8 at the @entity9 in @entity10
only this time , the metal door will not slam behind him , caging him in a bathroom - size cell
he will be a free man within the confines of what became a potent symbol of @entity17 's repression -- @entity6 's @entity18
@entity2 wants to return to the place where he witnessed a massacre that fuels his nightmares
sometimes , he said , his wife would wake him up in the middle of the night , saying , " @entity24
you are scaring the kids
" as many as 1,200 prisoners were killed at @entity9 in the summer of 1996 , according to @entity28
without justice , the infamous event festered in @entity6 's national psyche and eventually acted as tinder to spark the flame of revolt in february of this year
rebels stormed the prison a few days ago , freeing those held inside , including an @entity39 journalist
" i am so excited about @entity10 , " @entity2 said of the distinct possibility of the capital falling under rebel control
" this is the moment i have been waiting for for so many years
" since his release in 2000 , @entity2 had thought about @entity9 's dead
where were their bodies ? what was it like for their children to grow up without their fathers ? for a wife to not know what happened to her husband ? he vowed to expose the carnage of that june day
then this week in @entity59 , he watched a video posted on @entity61 that purportedly showed the storming of @entity9
@entity2 , now working with the opposition in @entity59 , knew he had to return there
he was waiting to board a plane to @entity10
or perhaps , with the fighting still raging in places like @entity17 's hometown of @entity69 , he will have to go by boat
with the @entity6 regime on the brink of collapse , @entity2 hopes the truth about @entity9 will finally be known
he is hardly alone in his wish
the shooting went on for almost three hours @entity2 was a teenage college student when he was arrested for offending the regime
inspired by perestroika reforms in the @entity80 in the late 1980s , he spoke out in favor of greater freedoms in his own country
@entity2 's mother , @entity84 , clearly remembers that day in 1988 when she returned to her home in @entity59 to find her daughters wailing
" we had no idea where he was , " she said from her home in @entity0
" whether he was alive or dead
" nineteen months passed before @entity91 learned , through contacts , her son 's whereabouts
after that , she occasionally made the long trek west from @entity59 to the prison in @entity10
the guards would drag her son out of his cell and into a warehouse at the entrance of the jail , where mother and son met
if she was lucky , she got 20 minutes with him , she said
she could never ask him about his situation
there were always guards listening in
he could never tell her about what he knew was going on in that jail -- beatings , torture , deaths
@entity2 spent eight years that way , in a cramped cell , without his family or the education he should have finished
his father died in 1994 and he was released for three days to attend the funeral
that was the extent of his freedom
then , on june 28 , 1996 , prisoners rioting over poor conditions and restricted family visits seized a guard and escaped from their cells
" five or seven minutes after it started , the guards on the roofs shot at the prisoners who were in the open areas , " @entity2 said in an interview with @entity28 many years later
security officials ordered the shooting to stop and feigned negotiations
but @entity2 told @entity28 that the officials instead called in firing squads to gun down about 1,200 people
he said a grenade was thrown into the courtyards where the prisoners were gathered
" i heard an explosion , and right after , a constant shooting started from heavy weapons and kalashnikovs from the top of the roofs , " he said
" the shooting continued from 11 until 1:35
" much later , while buying lamb at a slaughterhouse in the @entity39 , @entity2 commented to his brother @entity154 : not even here can they kill at the rate @entity17 's men did that day
" i could not see the dead prisoners who were shot , but i could see those who were shooting , " @entity2 told @entity28
" they were a special unit and wearing khaki military hats
i saw them -- at least six men -- on the roofs of the cellblocks
" the next day , @entity2 was ordered to clean the blood - smeared watches taken off the wrists of the dead
@entity28 said it had no way to verify @entity2 's story but another description of the incident from a report by the opposition @entity174 corroborated @entity2 's account
@entity17 's government did not acknowledge the killings and denied any crime had taken place
more than a decade after the @entity9 incident , the @entity180 noted that the @entity6 government was unable to provide any information on its investigation of the allegations
but the families , mostly from @entity59 , now the de facto rebel capital , did not abandon their longing for answers
some of them filed a complaint in a @entity6 court in 2007
the @entity17 regime offered them compensation in exchange for their silence , according to @entity28
but the families refused the money , considering it a bribe
instead , they boldly began to protest each saturday in @entity59 , an action unprecedented in @entity17 's four decades of rule
" it was radical , " said @entity203 , director of the @entity205 and @entity206 division at @entity28
the government began informing some of the families that their loved ones were dead
but no bodies was ever returned nor a cause of death given
among those waiting to find out more are three brothers in @entity0 whose father , opposition activist @entity216 , was plucked from his home 20 years ago
the @entity216 brothers know their father was detained at @entity9 -- they received letters from him in the early 1990s
but the letters stopped a few years into @entity216 's imprisonment
his sons do not know whether their father was among the massacre victims
@entity225 , a @entity6 - @entity39 journalism student in @entity226 , recalled in a blog post the funerals for the @entity9 victims held in the summer of 2009 when she visited @entity59
" @entity231 , " each family said
verily , we belong to @entity233 , and to @entity233 we return
@entity225 tripped over the words in @entity235 , but by the end of her stay she had repeated the phrase so many times that she was fluent
" i spent more time in tents that summer than in my own home , the cloth of my black abaya sticking irritatingly to my skin from the @entity246 humidity , " she wrote
" in the faces of the family of the dead , i detected relief in the sea of sadness
' at least now we know , ' they said
" then in february of this year , the regime arrested @entity256 , a human rights lawyer who represented some of the @entity9 families
hundreds of people jammed the streets of @entity59 to protest
@entity256 was released but the demonstrations did not stop
" the memories of that summer come rushing back as i watch the present events in @entity6 unfold from my home in @entity269 , @entity226 , " @entity264 wrote
" it was , after all , the @entity9 families who kick - started this revolution
it was they who initiated protests in @entity59 in front of police headquarters when their lawyer , @entity256 , was mysteriously detained by security officials
" exposing the carnage after 12 years at @entity9 , @entity2 was released in 2000
he often cried openly , with flashbacks triggered by something as small as macaroni reminiscent of @entity9 chow , said his older brother , @entity285
he eventually made his way to the @entity39 , where @entity154 lived
" @entity24 came here and had a mission , " @entity285 said
" he wanted to expose the massacre of @entity9
" @entity2 told @entity28 about the carnage he witnessed
he even approached the @entity291 , which includes the @entity9 massacre in its statements on human rights abuses in @entity6
as the civil war raged this year and @entity59 blossomed as a city free of @entity17 's grip , @entity2 , now 42 , returned there from @entity298 , @entity299
he took his wife and three children with him
he has been working with the opposition television station and telling the world about the dark secrets of @entity9
now , as the newly freed prisoners began returning home to @entity59 , @entity2 knew the time had come for him to go back to the prison
it is part of his own healing
the nation must heal , too , he believes
the first step will be to hold @entity6 leaders accountable for what happened at the prison
@entity91 is wary of her son 's trip to @entity10
she remains fearful about what might happen to him as long as @entity17 is still alive
but @entity2 is determined to complete his mission
he owes it to all those who survived @entity9
but mostly , he owes it to the souls of the dead .
