-- with car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right , it 's important to remember that today 's automotive titans started out as tiny startups , not unlike @entity8 entrepreneurs
@entity9 was almost called @entity10 names like @entity12 , @entity9 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today
but behind every brand name , there is a flesh - and - blood inventor , entrepreneur or industrialist
most of the time , they gave their name to the companies
and that fame was often about all they ended up with
@entity30 , who invented the overhead valve engine , founded the @entity32 in 1903
@entity33 , the industrialist who would eventually found @entity9 , took over the company in 1904 , when it ran into financial trouble
@entity36 stayed on as a director , but left in 1908 , never making much money from the enterprise
he reportedly died in 1929 , unable to afford one of his cars
@entity33 kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car , even though he worried that people might pronounce it " @entity48 , " according to one author
strangely enough , the man who practically created @entity9 single - handedly never really liked the idea of a ' @entity33 ' car
in another example , @entity53 invented the @entity55 , ' a two - seat runabout , in 1908
but he sold his stock in his @entity55 in 1911
he turned around and founded the @entity55 that same year
investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the " @entity55 " from his new company 's name and they won
his own automotive glory quickly faded , although the @entity55 survived until the 1940s
@entity67 - born @entity66 's experience was similar
@entity33 brought him into a new car - building venture in 1911 , hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver
@entity71 left the company in 1913 , apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles
but its name stuck to the new @entity71 vehicles ; @entity33 reportedly liked its musical lilt
it could also work the other way around
in 1925 , @entity80 got the naming rights to the @entity82 after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two - year period
things turned out a little differently for @entity88
he suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name
but his revenge was sweet
the @entity93 , which traded freely on @entity12 's early fame as an inventor , fired him in 1902 " because he was spending all his time developing a race car , not a passenger car , " according to the @entity96
@entity101 autos : @entity12 's ' @entity103 ' engineers most important new car after @entity12 was gone , the company was renamed @entity106 , after @entity107 , the @entity108 nobleman who founded @entity109 in 1703 ; his heraldry became the model 's badge and the company became a part of @entity9 in 1909
after his firing , @entity12 quickly found investors to help him found his own firm , the @entity12 , in 1903
he introduced the company 's first new vehicle , the model and followed it up with other low - cost vehicles , including his greatest achievement , the @entity122 , in 1908
its price tag started at $ 850 and fell steadily as @entity12 introduced more production innovations
the young firm became phenomenally successful
@entity101 autos : 10 classic @entity129 rides in the 1920s , he got the chance to buy the five - year - old @entity133 out of bankruptcy
it was then owned by one of the very people , @entity136 , who fired him in 1902
then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the @entity133 name
for its part , @entity9 almost did n't get the name it bears today
@entity33 actually incorporated his company under the name " @entity10 " , in @entity147 in 1908
but his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name
" we might use ' @entity154 ' were it not for the fact that there is already a @entity157 in that state , " the attorney wrote
" we suggest the name @entity9 , as we have ascertained it can be used
" a newly coined @entity108 word , auto - mobile , inspired many vehicle names of the early years
@entity163 filed a patent for an " auto - mobile " during the mid- 1890s
names like @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity55 , and of course , the @entity170 , could not have come along without it
the origins of some names can be tricky to trace
the first use of @entity175 , for instance
@entity178 , the author of a book called " jeep , " concludes that it 's based on early @entity183 slang for " a new , unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle
" it was n't until 1950 that @entity188 - based @entity187 , one of the producers of the early four - wheel - drive vehicle , trademarked the term
many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry
the @entity14 name came from the @entity198 loom works in @entity199 , @entity200 ; when it turned to car production , the @entity198 family changed the 'd ' to a ' t ' to make it simpler and more elegant in @entity200 script
@entity101 autos : top 10 best car names there 's little doubt about other brand names
@entity212 was an offshoot of the @entity214 , a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned @entity217 chief
mechanic @entity218 started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of @entity183 and eventually graduated to cars
@entity101 autos : pontiacs we 'll never forget @entity225 , a response to @entity228 's call for a car for the common folk , means ' people 's car ' in @entity233 , evidently beating out the prototype 's name , ' @entity236 , ' for the honors
in 1917 , the @entity238 became known as the @entity239 , or @entity239 ( @entity239 ) as the four - year - old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines , with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo , according to some authorities
the first @entity239 cars were produced 11 years later
the legendary @entity248 name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time
it beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a @entity255 ad agency in 1935
in 1939 , @entity88 struck gold with @entity257 , the fleet - footed messenger of the gods
it tapped into @entity262 and @entity263 mythology for the name , just as it did for the similarly styled @entity265 , the god of the wind , three years earlier
some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms
@entity270 stands for @entity271 , or @entity272
similarly , @entity273 stands for @entity274 , or @entity275 , hearkening back to the automaker 's origins as an aircraft company
@entity12 might have done better with an acronym in 1958
the @entity280 was conceived as a new , distinct @entity12 brand , with its own models , badge and division
the mission was to take on @entity9 's @entity170
after considering thousands of suggestions , @entity12 named the new brand after @entity288 , @entity88 's only child
he had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943
the name @entity280 was an immediate letdown
@entity12 stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced
one disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales
@entity101 autos : best and worst automotive designs of all time its name was n't the sole reason for its failure
it did n't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on @entity12 and @entity257 models
but all that did n't stop @entity280 from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure .
