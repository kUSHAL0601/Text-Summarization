@entity0 -- the first days of the protests in @entity3 were torture for @entity5
" i waited two days and i finally heard my mom 's voice , " says @entity5 , who lives just outside of @entity0 with her husband , @entity6
" and of course when i heard her voice i started crying , and screaming ' come home
' " her parents , @entity13 and @entity14 , live half the year in @entity15 , and the other half in @entity17 , just 20 minutes from @entity18 , the epicenter of recent protests
after days of not hearing from her parents , her worry turned to frustration
random families answered her repeated phone calls because the telephones were getting crossed , she says
" i kept calling and calling , " says @entity5 , the youngest of three children , and the only one of her siblings to be born in the @entity32
" i had to purchase a calling card and that was the only way i could get through
" @entity5 's parents immigrated to the @entity32 with only $ 45 to their name more than 30 years ago
they were in @entity17 when the protests broke out , and have decided to remain in @entity17
" she does n't want to come home , " @entity5 says , referring to a recent phone conversation she had with her mother
" ' we need peaceful democracy @entity44 , ' that 's all she kept saying
' it 's a revolution and we want peaceful democracy
and i 'm going to stay until its finished
' " people across @entity3 took to the streets on january 25 in demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies partly inspired by similar january rallies that erupted in @entity54
since the protests began , president @entity55 -- in power since 1981 -- has appointed a vice president for the first time , reshuffled his cabinet and announced that he wo n't seek a new term in september
as the chaos enters its third week , @entity5 's daughter , @entity62 , eagerly awaits her grandmother 's return
" i just wish she was here
even though it 's crazy , she does n't want to leave , i do n't get why , but she does n't want to go , " she says
@entity62 says she supports the protesters , but not the violence
" i would rather them not be violent , and , i am worried about my family
this is an extremely serious thing
they ( the people ) do n't act like this , " she says
" so , i was surprised and worried
" a sophomore at @entity75 , @entity62 first read about the protests on @entity77 where she learned the internet was being shut down
as the events escalated and gained more international interest , she was overwhelmed by the onslaught of questions from classmates
" it 's sad that people really did n't know anything about the way it was before
but i 'm hoping this ( uprising ) will implement and bring changes for the better , " she says
@entity62 's brother @entity91 , a freshman at @entity75 , says he would be among the protesters if he were in @entity3
" fighting for a free democracy is something that 's great , they definitely deserve the right to do that , " he says
" i feel like they should be protesting , they should be fighting for their county to get better , they should be wanting things to get better , because they deserve it , they want a better life
" a better life is what @entity44 and @entity107 were looking for when they came to the @entity32
the couple constantly stressed how blessed the family was to live in @entity32 , and told the children to take advantage of the opportunities before them , she says
when things in @entity3 began to settle down a bit last week , @entity44 said her parents tried to ease her fears by talking about everyday events
" my mom said that the rabbits had 12 babies , and the pigeons had six babies , and the @entity126 shepherd is pregnant
so , that 's my conversation with them , other than that , she says nothing to worry about , " @entity5 says , letting out a loud laugh
joking aside , she knows the seriousness of the events
the uprising is long overdue , she says
" it 's a blessing in disguise what 's going on , this needs to be done , " she says .
