-- what is the value and impact of international aid ? in an era of global austerity , this is a question that is frequently posed by policymakers and the citizens they represent
the truth is , it is actually quite hard to measure
but there are important questions about both the quantity and quality of aid that must be answered
contrary to popular perception , aid is not one homogenous entity or a single transfer of money from donor to recipient countries
the term " international aid " actually covers a wide variety of things , including food and commodities , advice and training , and debt relief
in 2011 -- the last year we have comprehensive data for -- total development aid from rich countries stood at nearly $ 150 billion , according to the investments to end poverty report
only $ 59 billion identifiably involves the transfer of actual cash to , for example , recipient governments , @entity44 operating on the ground or special project funds
aid in kind makes up another $ 25 billion
most of this is food aid , which is used to tackle acute hunger -- but even this form of aid is not without controversy
many donors avoid shipping actual food to developing countries , aware that it destroys local markets and harms local farmers
research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money , especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world
sorghum shipped from the @entity70 is 200 % more expensive than it is in @entity71 and almost 100 % more than in @entity72 , according to @entity74 calculations
despite this , the @entity70 and @entity75 continue to make extensive use of food shipments
perhaps even more surprising is the fact that large amounts of aid money never actually leave rich countries
as much as $ 22 billion -- or 20 % of bilateral aid spending -- is spent on activities in donor countries or put towards the cancellation of debt
this includes funds to cover housing , food and other services for the first 12 months of refugees ' stay in the donor country
it also includes public spending on universities to cover the costs for students from developing countries
in 2011 , $ 4.5 billion was spent on refugee costs , $ 3.5 billion on university costs and around $ 7.5 billion on debt relief
as important as these expenditures may be , they do not result in any transfer of resources to developing nations
these schemes may of course be beneficial to recipient countries in the long term -- for example , contributing to capacity development if students return to their countries
but it is undeniable that these schemes are at odds with the common perception of aid as financial support transferred from donor to recipient countries to fight poverty
these different elements of aid obviously have very different effects on economic development and growth
a dollar of cash will have a very different impact to a dollar 's worth of food or a dollar 's worth of a consultant 's time
it is difficult to understand just how bundling all of these items into one lump sum can allow us to draw meaningful and reliable conclusions about the value of aid
this lack of clarity was part of the motivation for investments to @entity154 -- a major new report that analyzes aid in all of its complexity
at @entity74 we reviewed each individual record of foreign aid from @entity162 donors over the period 2006 - 2011 -- over a million rows of data
now , for the first time ever , we can see just how much aid flows between specific countries and , crucially , what that aid consists of
for example , according to our calculations , @entity171 and @entity172 both gave very similar levels of bilateral aid , just above $ 2 billion , in 2011
but almost 70 % of @entity171 's aid stayed in the country , spent on refugee costs and debt relief , whereas around 70 % of @entity172 's aid resulted in a transfer of resources to developing countries
on the recipient side , some countries that appear to receive considerable funds in fact receive a lot less than advertised
our research found that of the $ 7.5 billion in aid reported as given to the @entity192 in 2011 , more than $ 5 billion was not transferred to that country , and consisted instead of debt relief
all of this matters because we are at a crossroads in international development
in the last few decades , we have seen unprecedented progress in alleviating poverty , as recognised by world leaders meeting at the @entity201 in @entity202 in september
there is a growing consensus that we can end extreme poverty by 2030
the truth is that we can not meet this goal without international aid
while @entity210 and remittances undoubtedly contribute to economic growth in developing countries , aid is the only international resource flow which can be targeted explicitly to improve the lives of the poorest people around the world
in @entity219 alone , 400 million people live in extreme poverty and require interventions that are targeted and complementary to existing support to lift them out of it
without the support of international aid , most poor people will be left behind
if we want to maximize the impact and reach of international aid , we need to ensure that every dollar is spent as efficiently as possible
we can only do this with better information and a clear understanding
then policymakers in both donor and recipient countries can make better and more informed decisions , and civil society can better monitor progress and hold them to account
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .
