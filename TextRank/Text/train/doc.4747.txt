-- secretary of state @entity1 closed a trip to the @entity3 saying countries " in the region " and " outside the region " are prepared to engage in military assistance against @entity7 and " in actual strikes if that is what it requires

in an interview taped saturday in @entity20 , @entity21 , that aired on @entity23 ' " @entity22 " sunday , @entity1 said some nations " are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the @entity26 and to do airstrikes , if that 's what they 're called on to do , " but did not get more specific
separately , a @entity26 official traveling with @entity1 told reporters , " there have been offers to ( @entity37 ) from @entity17 countries willing to take more kinetic actions , " according to a pool report
on @entity23 , @entity1 admitted that airstrikes alone will not solve the challenge of defeating @entity7 , but he reiterated the administration 's stance that there is no plan to put troops on the ground outside of local @entity49 forces and @entity51 rebel groups
" well , we 're not looking to put troops on the ground
there are some ( nations ) who have offered to do so , but we are not looking for that at this moment anyway , " @entity1 said
@entity59 to the @entity61 strategy is an effort to train and equip @entity51 rebel forces
on @entity0 's " @entity65 , " @entity61 chief of staff @entity64 said : " we have had a relationship with these fighters now for a couple of years
they 're getting better and more capable
and what 's most important here is that the @entity51 opposition on the ground fighting @entity7 can count on @entity26 and coalition airpower to supercharge their effort
that 's important and that 's ultimately going to be what is called for in this strategy
" @entity7 , which calls itself the @entity81 , is also known by the acronym @entity7

" " i will not let this president suggest to the @entity26 people we can outsource our security
and this is not about our safety -- there is no way in hell you can form an army on the ground to go into @entity51 to destroy @entity7 without a substantial @entity26 component , " @entity83 said
" this is a turning point in the war on terror
we are fighting a terrorist army , not an organization , " @entity83 said
" it 's going to take an army to beat an army , and this idea that we 'll never have any boots on the ground to defeat them in @entity51 is fantasy
" " this president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home , " @entity83 said
