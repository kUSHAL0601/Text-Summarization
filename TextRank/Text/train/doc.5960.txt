-- the bodies of three men have been found in shallow graves in eastern @entity4 , all of them believed to have been killed after answering a @entity8 ad to work on a cattle farm , according to authorities
the @entity13 medical examiner 's office on saturday identified one of the victims as @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity4
the 47 - year - old 's death , caused by " gunshot wounds to the head , " was ruled a homicide , the office said in an audio recording
a phone call led police friday to @entity16 's body in a shallow grave behind an @entity30 mall , authorities said
multiple law enforcement authorities , including @entity33 officials , have tied @entity16 's death to a wider investigation into the two other killings
in his last @entity38 posting , dated november 10 , @entity16 wrote : " just got one of the strangest job offers
a good offer but strange
the job is to watch over 680 acres south of @entity43
odd jobs and such but mainly just secure it
trailer , utilities , salary
drawbacks ? no cell phone service , kids are up here , and i have to move this sunday
" meanwhile , the body of a " white male " was also discovered friday " in a shallow grave in @entity59 , " about 120 miles south of @entity30 , @entity56 sheriff @entity55 said in a statement
the sheriff did not respond to calls saturday from @entity0
but @entity55 said earlier this month that there are " two suspects in custody " in the case
@entity65 told @entity0 affiliate @entity66 that his 16 - year - old son @entity67 of @entity68 is among them , charged with attempted murder
the father claimed that his son had been " manipulated " and " corrupted , " insisting that his son is a " mild - mannered gentleman
" the other suspect in the case -- 52 - year - old @entity75 of @entity30 , as identified on a @entity13 court website -- is being held on unrelated charges
no attorney was listed for @entity75 in the court document
the investigation began the night of november 6 , when a @entity56 deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a " white , middle - aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm , " according to @entity55
the shooting victim , who is from @entity87 and was not identified by police , told the sheriff he had answered an ad on the @entity8 website offering work caring for cattle on a 688 - acre property
@entity66 : body of missing @entity17 man identified he met with the two suspects and drove with them toward @entity59
after being told a road was closed due to a landslide , the @entity87 man got out of the car to start walking toward the property , which he was told was nearby
he told the sheriff that , while walking through a heavily wooded area , he then turned around " to see a gun pointed at his head
he deflected the gun and ran " -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing , according to the sheriff
the victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help , @entity55 said
then , on november 11 , the sheriff received a call from a @entity117 , @entity116 , woman who said her twin brother had not been seen since october 22 in @entity119 , @entity120
the brother had also answered a @entity8 ad " and she felt very sure it was the same advertisement ( the shooting victim from @entity87 ) had answered
" on november 15 , authorities -- including agents from the @entity33 and @entity4 's @entity127 , plus " cadaver - sniffing " dogs -- found " the body of a white male buried in a shallow grave " near where the first man had been shot , @entity55 said
police have not identified the body
the sheriff tied that man 's death to the investigation of the shooting that left the @entity87 man wounded in the arm
multiple authorities since then have also linked the two bodies discovered friday -- including that of @entity16 -- with the same investigation
@entity146 , 19 , told @entity0 that he last saw his father november 12 after he 'd gone with another son for the job interview
" he was all stoked about it , " @entity146 said of his father 's feelings about the opportunity to work on the cattle farm
" my brother ... thought the whole situation was sketchy
" @entity16 ended up going to the would - be job site alone , not with the 17 - year - old son who 'd accompanied him to the interview , @entity146 said
the same son added that his father , divorced and with three children , worked " odd jobs " including recently as a street cleaner in @entity166
he said that his father saw his children daily , adding that the whole family is struggling to come to grips with his death
" we 're just trying to get through this , " @entity146 said saturday .
