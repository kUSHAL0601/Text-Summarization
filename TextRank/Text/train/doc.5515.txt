-- @entity1 is back on track after a severe allergic reaction put the pop star in the hospital
the 21 - year - old is scheduled to resume her previously postponed " @entity8 " tour in august after being forced to hold off on the remaining performances due to her illness
@entity1 ' new @entity12 lineup features nine stops : seven shows to make up for the ones that she missed , plus an additional two concerts for fans in @entity19 and @entity20
fans who purchased tickets to her april 7 concert in @entity25 , @entity26 ; the april 16 show in @entity28 ; and the april 15 show in @entity30 , @entity31 ; will receive full refunds and be able to purchase tickets to her rescheduled dates -- on august 6 , august 10 and august 12 , respectively -- starting may 2
those who purchased tickets to her april concerts in @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 ; @entity42 ; and @entity43 will be able to use them for admission to her august shows in those locations
the " @entity50 " songstress was initially put out of commission in early april with a flu - like illness , which caused her to pull out of her @entity25 show
yet after being prescribed the antibiotic @entity55 her health woes only grew worse ; an allergic reaction to the drug left @entity1 hospitalized for more than a week , according to a statement from her representative earlier this month
by april 25 she seemed back to her old self
if her @entity64 photos are to be believed , pancakes were a part of her recuperation
@entity1 ' next " @entity8 " stop will be @entity68 , as she kicks off the @entity70 leg of her tour on friday .
