@entity0 -- a bill to allow same - sex marriage in @entity4 and @entity5 is now law , though the unions are n't expected to take place until 2014
@entity9 has given her assent to the landmark bill , which the @entity12 passed tuesday , the house 's speaker , @entity13 , said wednesday
the first same - sex wedding could be held as early as next summer
the law does not come into force immediately because government departments need time to make changes
new processes must be drawn up for registrars , and new forms will also have to be drawn up
the government expects to announce a more formal timetable for the implementation of the law in the fall
the @entity29 cleared the @entity30 and the @entity12 this week , just before the summer recess
the monarch 's assent -- a formality in the @entity35 -- makes the measure official
what you need to know about same - sex marriages in the @entity40 and worldwide the bill had the backing of @entity35 prime minister @entity43 , but his commitment to it put him at odds with many in his @entity48 and its grass - roots supporters
the @entity50 govern in coalition with the @entity52
the bill was also opposed by religious groups , including the @entity55
the @entity56 in @entity4 and @entity5 said that the law 's passage " marks a watershed in @entity4 law and heralds a profound social change , " and that it regretted that the bill had been " rushed though " @entity63
" with this new legislation , marriage has now become an institution in which openness to children , and with it the responsibility on fathers and mothers to remain together to care for children born into their family unit , are no longer central
that is why we were opposed to this legislation on principle , " a statement said
' go forth and propose ' the debate over the legislation became heated at times in the @entity12 , where the issue exposed divisions within @entity43 's party
conservative mp @entity85 angered many when he referred to " the aggressive homosexual community " that would " see this is as but a stepping stone to something even further
" responding to the news that the law had passed , @entity92 lawmaker @entity91 tweeted : " @entity9 has given @entity95 to @entity96
aggressive homosexuals , please note
" the new law will allow same - sex couples to marry in civil or religious ceremonies
however , religious organizations must explicitly " opt in " if they want to perform such ceremonies , and the religious minister conducting the ceremony must also agree
the law also protects religious organizations and their representatives who do n't wish to conduct marriages of same - sex couples from being challenged in the courts
it will allow couples in civil partnerships to convert to marriage if they wish
the new law also allows married men or women who wish to change their gender to do so without ending their marriage
a law recognizing civil partnerships in @entity4 and @entity5 was passed in 2004
the issue of same - sex marriage has also divided other nations
a law that allows same - sex couples to marry and adopt was passed by @entity128 this year , despite large street protests and vocal opposition from religious groups
the move made it the ninth country in @entity134 to allow same - sex marriage
in the @entity40 , two landmark rulings by the @entity137 last month gave the gay and lesbian rights movement huge political and legal momentum
by the numbers : same - sex marriage the justices said legally married same - sex couples will now enjoy the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples , striking down a key provision in the @entity148
and although not granting a sweeping right of gays and lesbians to marry nationwide , a separate high court ruling effectively allows same - sex marriage to resume in @entity154 , the nation 's most populous state
