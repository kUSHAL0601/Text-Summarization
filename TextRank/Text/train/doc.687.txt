-- @entity1 recently spent a night in a jail in @entity3
she apparently was a little ticked off at the behavior of some of the folks who watched over her stay
the @entity9 - winning singer told the audience at her next show about it , and videos of her harsh speech were posted on the web
the @entity16 must have gotten wind of it because its public information officer issued a sharp rebuttal monday
@entity20 even had some advice for @entity22 : " just shut up and sing
" @entity24 agents arrested @entity22 after finding marijuana and hashish on her tour bus on wednesday
investigators found 0.010 pounds of marijuana and 0.010 pounds of hashish , a statement said
after she was released from jail , @entity22 did a concert in @entity36 where she launched into her critical remarks before her first song
" most of the people were very nice to me , " she said
" there are four of you out there , and i want you to know that i heard everything you did
i wrote it all down with your names and everything you did and said stupidly thinking i could n't hear or see you
" then it got interesting
@entity22 said she ripped the paper up , not before " encoding " the information and putting it in a " lock box " or a " holding cell
" another holding cell holds the decoder and @entity22 is the only one with the key , she said
she said the behavior of the four was inappropriate and likely illegal
@entity20 said it was the official position of the sheriff 's office that if she has a legal complaint she should call the state attorney general
" we 'll give her the number if she needs that , " the release said
@entity22 told the @entity36 concertgoers that she was going to keep the information private unless " you 're interested in being a celebrity , i 'll make you ... famous any time you ask , " she said , referring to members of the sheriff 's department
@entity20 was not amused , it seems
" first , honey , i 'm already more famous than you , i do n't need your help
however , it would appear that you need mine
two weeks ago nobody in the country cared about what you had to say
now that you 've been arrested it appears your entire career has been jump started
do n't worry , sweetie , i wo n't bill you , " he wrote
the sultry - voiced singer first shot to fame in 1997 with her hit single , " criminal , " which earned her a @entity9 for best female vocal rock performance
she is currently on tour promoting her new album and was scheduled to perform in @entity97 on monday night
so far , no new videos on @entity99
more celeb arrests : @entity101 in trouble again @entity0 's @entity103 and @entity104 contributed to this report .
