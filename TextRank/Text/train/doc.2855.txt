-- february 8 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity12 , @entity13 : today 's show goes out to our @entity16 fans at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20
get ready to update your maps , because the world is about to get a new country ! i 'm @entity26
this is @entity0 ! first up : meeting with business @entity29 : first up , president @entity30 and business : can they work together ? the president has not had the best relationship with business leaders , specifically with the @entity37 @entity36
the group was against the health care and @entity41 reform laws that the president pushed for and passed
and the @entity36 supported a lot of @entity45 candidates in last year 's midterm elections
the @entity37 @entity36 is the country 's largest business organization
it represents 3 million businesses from all across the @entity37 and its main purpose is to work on behalf of those businesses , especially in @entity51
during his speech to the 200 members of the @entity36 yesterday , president @entity30 acknowledged the tension between them
but he says he 's convinced that they can and must work together
one thing that both sides want : more jobs
the president promised that he 'll work on programs and policies , like spending money on education and improving transportation networks , that would help the country 's businesses and would help get the economy back on track
economy in @entity71 @entity29 : things are moving forward in @entity4
the country 's new cabinet had its first meeting yesterday
there are some protesters still out in the streets , saying they 're not gon na budge until president @entity79 steps down
@entity79 has said he wo n't run for re-election in september
we 've talked a lot about what all this political upheaval could mean for @entity4 's government in the future
@entity87 is looking at what it means for @entity4 's economy right now
( begin video ) @entity93 , @entity94 correspondent : as anti-mubarak protesters remain entrenched in @entity99 's @entity98 , the effects of the uprising are visible nationwide
this is @entity101 , a massive real estate development outside @entity4 's capital with 1,500 housing units under construction
owner @entity106 says work has come to a virtual standstill since the protests began
@entity110 , president , @entity112 : we had to slow down because we could not get the materials in time , most of the laborers could not come
now , we are starting to organize ourselves to go back to work
maybe $ 4 - $ 5 million of losses per month at least
@entity119 : @entity106 says if things do n't improve , he might have to start laying off workers
one bank estimates this crisis is costing @entity4 more than $ 300 million a day as the economy remains in a state of paralysis
@entity4 's economy is losing a lot of money every day and business people fear the long - term consequences could be grave , as investors lose their confidence and tourists start choosing other destinations
many business sectors are affected , some only now coming back to life
as shop owners slowly began opening their doors on @entity99 's streets on sunday , banks serviced customers for this first time since the beginning of the crisis
to prevent the masses from pulling their cash out of the institutions , private withdrawals were limited to $ 10,000 or 50,000 @entity4 pounds
despite long lines , most appeared calm
@entity154 [ @entity155 ] : " there are a lot of people who are withdrawing money because banks were closed in the last few days , " this man says
" many people are withdrawing money
" @entity119 : @entity106 says though the fallout from the uprising is seriously hurting his business interests , he understands the anti-government protesters
@entity167 : i have personal sympathy for them
i think there was corruption , it is a time of change
but my personal view is that we should give the people that are in charge now that are trying to clean up and put this country together a chance
@entity119 : but it does n't seem like the anti-government protesters are willing to give the current government that chance
as many @entity4 fight for social change , many workers on construction sites like this one are fighting and praying to keep their jobs
@entity190 , @entity0 , @entity99 , @entity4
( @entity191 ) @entity192 @entity29 : to the south of @entity4 is @entity5 , a country that 's about to be split in half -- literally
in a referendum last month , nearly 99 percent of southern @entity195 voted to split from the north and form their own country
@entity5 's @entity200 fought a war against each other for more than two decades
the peace treaty that ended that conflict led to this vote
the country 's president has said he 'll accept the results of the election , so @entity5 could become the world 's newest nation by this summer
this day in history @entity29 : it 's february 8th
this day in history : in 1910 , the @entity214 was founded by @entity215
he was inspired after being helped by a @entity217 scout when he got lost in @entity219
is this legit ? @entity220 , @entity13 : is this legit ? the symptoms of a concussion can include nausea , dizziness and memory problems
and anyone who 's gotten one of these brain injuries is more likely to get another one
protecting @entity232 athletes @entity29 : concussions are pretty common in contact sports like football
at the @entity238 level , there are around 100 concussions every year
but when you look at the number of teens and younger kids who go to the er for sports - related concussions , that number jumps to more than 100,000 ! doctor @entity247 shows us how one program uses prevention and preparation to address the problem
( begin video ) @entity247 , @entity254 : most of these players see themselves as mini-versions of these guys
@entity259 , president , sports legacy institute : youth football is trying to be the professional game , sometimes for good , but sometimes for bad
@entity264 : the good ? competition
and the ugly ? a tendency trickling down from the pros to hide head injuries
@entity271 : when you are 13 , you have the same drives to play through pain , play through injury - not wanting to look weak in front of your friends or weak in front of your enemies
guys went great lengths to hide injuries or not talk about them
@entity264 : it turns out hiding has consequences , first seen at the @entity238 level
retired players consumed with depression , rage , memory problems
their symptoms associated with the mysterious brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy
it looks like dementia , but it strikes players in their 30s , 40s and 50s , sometimes younger
@entity271 : the reality is , we do have cases of teenagers having the disease
we 're primary football players
some play multi-sports , but they all had brain trauma
@entity306 , president , @entity308 : well , it 's brain damage
i mean , that 's what it comes down to
how can you want that for any child ? does your head go up or down ? team : up ! @entity319 : @entity320 goes up or down ? team : up ! @entity319 : let 's go ! @entity264 : @entity322 coaches the @entity323
it 's a team of fifth graders in @entity326 , @entity327
last year , he had a typical playbook
@entity319 : we do drills like bull in the ring , you know , one kid 's in the middle and you walk around and tap a kid , and then you just go at it , head - to - head , hammer to hammer
@entity264 : and during games ? @entity319 : the kid came out and he got a hard hit , what we used to call a stinger or a ding , you know
we would sit there and say , " hey , are you ok ? " and then send him back in if he answered yes
@entity264 : when his team clocked 20 concussions in one season , coach @entity352 said enough
his new playbook starts with a concussion course for coaches , parents and players ; a trainer at games and practice
@entity364 : do you have any nausea or dizziness ? @entity154 : no. @entity264 : and far less hitting in practice ; an emphasis on technique , not brute force
@entity319 : this is what we do n't want to see
ok ? the spine is lined up
@entity264 : the impact ? the @entity323 cut the number of concussions in half and still made the playoffs
@entity271 : it did not hurt the kids ' ability to play the game
it just dramatically lowered their injury rate and their head trauma rate
and so , when you look at how simple those things were made in one season , in one program , you wonder why is n't everybody else doing this ? ( @entity191 ) @entity392 @entity29 : good info there
now , you heard today 's show dedicated to some of our @entity16 fans
if you love our show and you 're on @entity16 , show us some like ! @entity320 over to @entity16 / @entity401 and click the " like " button
we 'd like that a lot
before we go @entity29 : we might have bitten off more than we can chew with today 's before we go story
but at least we 're in good company
all of these ingredients combine to make this ! the @entity409 ! six hamburger patties ; 12 pieces of bacon ; six fried eggs ; all the usual fixin 's ; plus jalapenos and peanut butter ! if you have n't eaten lunch yet , you might not want to
this thing takes up the entire grill just to make a @entity409
and more than 60 people have tried and failed to take it down
goodbye @entity29 : but for the valiant effort , they deserve a patty on the back
after looking at the bun - dle of food , we want to know what you would include on your extreme burger
you can talk to us about your recipes at @entity16 / @entity401
we 'll see you again tomorrow .
