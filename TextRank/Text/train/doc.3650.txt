in the semifinals of the @entity8 tournament
the 16 - time champion , who is six weeks away from beating @entity11 's record of 286 weeks as the globe 's top - ranked men 's player , lost to @entity4 on a rain - soaked clay court in under 90 minutes
@entity16 will now face @entity8 's @entity17 in monday 's final
however , the 28 - year - old @entity1 -- who beat @entity19 to win the event in 2008 -- remained confident about his clay - court form , despite this loss coming on the back of an opening match defeat at last month 's @entity25
" i 'm not worried , " @entity1 told the official web site of the @entity3
" my goal is n't to win 12 tournaments a year , it is the big events : the masters , the grand slams and keeping the number one ranking
" my decision to come to @entity36 was the right decision
i would like to return again in future
i know that good things are around the corner , " @entity1 added
" i 'm disappointed to have played a match like this , where i got off to a bad start again
i did n't play that badly in the second set , i had my moments but my movement was a little slow
" i 'm lacking matches , " said @entity1
" i 'll keep practicing hard again
conditions will speed up in @entity48 and @entity49 [ at @entity50 ]
i must take positives into the next few weeks
" @entity1 was using the tournament as a warm - up to the @entity54 , where the @entity56 ace will be looking to defend his title when the tournament starts at @entity50 on may 23
@entity59 of @entity60 beat @entity5 's @entity61 6 - 2 7 - 5 to win the women 's final in @entity36
meanwhile , world number two @entity63 pulled out of the @entity65 on saturday due to continued breathing problems
an allergic reaction to pollen in the air forced the 22 - year - old player to retire from a game at the @entity72 on friday .
