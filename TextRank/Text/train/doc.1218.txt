-- the first of twin research spacecraft entered the moon 's orbit saturday , part of an effort to learn more about how it and other terrestrial bodies formed , @entity1 said
the @entity10 -- which launched from @entity12 's @entity11 on september 10 , along with its sister spacecraft @entity10 -- began a " lunar orbit insertion burn " at about 4:30 p.m. et , @entity1 said on an associated @entity16 feed
that burn was set to finish around 5 p.m. the second in the pair , @entity10 , will follow suit sunday
" burn complete ! # grail - a is now orbiting the moon and awaiting the arrival of its twin @entity24 on @entity26 , " @entity1 's @entity21 announced on @entity16
the two orbiters , each 3 1/2 feet high and 2 1/2 feet deep , are named for @entity1 's @entity10
they will fly in tandem orbits , measuring the gravity field and ideally answering " longstanding questions about the moon and ( giving ) scientists a better understanding of how @entity35 and other rocky planets in the solar system formed , " according to @entity1
the moon is about 250,000 miles from @entity35 , a distance that @entity1 's @entity41 crews reached in about three days
but the grail spacecrafts took much longer , namely 3Â½ months , because they covered more than 2.5 million miles " reshaping and merging their orbits " so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon , @entity1 said
the orbiters , whose mission was timed to miss lunar eclipses in december and june , are expected to collect data for 82 days
@entity51 , principal investigator for @entity10 , said the moon remains mysterious in many ways and little is known about the process of how it was formed
scientists theorize that the moon formed when a @entity59 - sized object crashed into @entity35
it remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side
the basins are flooded with volcanic material on one side , and the other side has mountainous highlands
why did these sides evolve differently ? " we think the answer is locked in the interior , " @entity51 said at a @entity1 news briefing wednesday
a study published in the journal nature over the summer suggested that there may have been a second moon moving at about the same speed as our moon , and in the same orbit
the second moon bumped into the original moon , the theory goes , and caused the formation of a mountain instead of a crater
this model predicts the whole exterior of the moon was once molten and cooled from the outside in such a way that when the second moon hit our moon , it pushed all of that molten material to the near side
@entity10 can help test this hypothesis
the spacecraft are designed to help scientists explore the interior of the moon indirectly by measuring the pull of gravity as they fly over the surface
with data about these changes in gravity and topography , scientists will be able to construct a map of what 's inside our celestial neighbor
scientists wanted the spacecraft to be as small as possible so they could launch in one rocket
but they were n't sure if the orbiters would make it through eclipses that happen at the moon every six months , since their technology depends on lithium - ion batteries and solar panels
a lunar eclipse occurred in early december , and the next one is in june
based on the current performance , scientists think @entity10 can continue through the june eclipse
should one of the orbiters completely fail , scientists could not get the high precision they would get from the two spacecraft ; the mission depends on having both , @entity51 said
if the lunar orbit insertion does n't happen for one of the spacecraft , there would be another opportunity to try again in late april .
