@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 republicans will not watch monday night 's presidential debate in the same way as typical voters across the country
any good politician knows this
the state 's traditional blend of fiscal conservatism and social tolerance poses a tricky challenge for the seven @entity16 candidates onstage at @entity17
answers that win applause in @entity21 living rooms might not work as well in the @entity1
discussions of faith , now common in presidential debates , are important to most @entity16 voters in other early primary and caucus states
but religion is not as central to life in @entity1 , where social conservatives hold limited sway
a quarter of @entity33 go to church on a typical sunday , far below the national average
this state is one of the few where same - sex marriage is legal
in 2009 , when a @entity41 legislature and governor replaced civil unions with same - sex marriage , many local @entity16 were angry
despite a sharp turn to the right in both the @entity47 and @entity48 in the 2010 elections , quick reversal of the new law has not become a top @entity16 priority
according to a @entity54 poll in february , 37 % of @entity16 strongly support repeal
ending same - sex marriage is extremely important to just 5 % of the state 's voters
as a result , questions asked monday night about divisive social topics may get more attention along @entity63 , @entity64 , than on @entity65
other issues are more important here
@entity1 's reputation as a conservative @entity16 stronghold is well - deserved
the state 's most influential modern governor , @entity69 , left a tight - fisted legacy of small government that endures more than three decades later
his populist slogan , " ax the tax , " ensured that the sales and income taxes accepted in most states would remain political poison here for decades
in november , a new populist wave arrived
@entity82 insurgents won scores of state legislative seats
the activists then overwhelmed the @entity16 establishment , electing allies as @entity47 speaker and state party chairman
in this new political climate , issues that matter to libertarians , strict constitutionalists and fiscal conservatives are moving to center stage
past attempts to weaken unions went nowhere
but labor now has few @entity16 friends in @entity1
a controversial right - to - work bill , which would make most union membership voluntary , may be passed over @entity41 gov. @entity103 's veto
limitations on government are important to many of these new activists
many embrace the 10th amendment , which they see as essential protection against a too - powerful federal government
they have no use for " compassionate conservativism , " which they see as nothing but big , intrusive bureaucracy
eminent domain is another government power distrusted by many of these new conservative activists
a controversial power line proposal that depended on state confiscation of rural land already faced broad opposition , but the new activists ' votes may prove decisive in blocking the project
questions that touch on some of these issues may seem unusual elsewhere , but not here
the answers will have real impact as @entity1 's republicans and independents begin studying the field
to avoid stumbling here , candidates must remember that the @entity1 is changing but it remains unique
treating its voters like @entity139 would be as foolish as confusing ethanol with maple syrup .
