-- @entity2 on friday finished delivering its backlog of holiday packages , company spokeswoman @entity1 told @entity0
the company earlier this week said that the volume of packages in its system exceeded its capacity , causing delays
the delays meant that some packages were not delivered before @entity12 , despite promises by some retailers
@entity2 did not provide numbers , but the spokeswoman said the backlog was cleared friday
" yes , the holiday packages have been delivered , " @entity18 said
the company considered @entity12 deliveries as an emergency measure , but " after much thought and consideration " decided not to ask drivers to work on the holiday
the delays angered many customers , who took to social media to vent their frustrations
the company said that previous severe weather in the @entity33 area had already created a backlog , and the holiday volume proved too much
@entity36 was late with some deliveries as well , but called them " isolated incidents
" on saturday , @entity36 reported that " any isolated issues are resolved
" the @entity40 did not comment on whether it experienced any similar delays
@entity0 's @entity42 contributed to this report .
