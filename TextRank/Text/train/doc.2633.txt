preliminary results in sunday 's referendum on whether @entity4 's @entity3 region should join @entity5 or become an independent state show overwhelming support for @entity5
with 75 % percent of the ballots counted , close to 96 % of voters want to become part of that country , according to the @entity12
an official had announced earlier that more than 80 % of voters had cast ballots by the time polls closed at 8 p.m. local time ( 2 p.m. et ) sunday
final results are expected later
" we are going home
@entity3 is in @entity5 , " @entity3 's prime minister @entity21 told crowds celebrating in @entity24 's @entity23
music blared as they cheered and waved @entity5 flags
the @entity27 has already said it expects the @entity30 peninsula 's majority ethnic @entity5 population to vote in favor of joining @entity5
@entity32 has strongly backed the referendum
@entity27 president @entity34 and @entity5 president @entity35 spoke sunday , according to a readout from the @entity37
" president @entity34 emphasized that the @entity12 ' referendum , ' which violates the @entity4 constitution and occurred under duress of @entity5 military intervention , would never be recognized by the @entity27 and the international community , " it said
" he emphasized that @entity5 's actions were in violation of @entity4 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and that , in coordination with our @entity52 partners , we are prepared to impose additional costs on @entity5 for its actions
" earlier , the @entity37 released a statement that said the vote was " administered under threats of violence and intimidation from a @entity5 military intervention that violates international law
" the voting has put the @entity27 and @entity5 on the kind of collision course not seen since the end of the @entity66
@entity27 secretary of state @entity67 reaffirmed in a call with @entity5 foreign minister @entity69 that the @entity27 considered the referendum illegal under @entity4 law and that the @entity27 would not recognize the outcome
the @entity73 on sunday repeated its " strong condemnation " of the referendum and called on @entity5 to withdraw its troops from the region
it , too , has called the referendum illegal and said it is looking at sanctions
@entity69 said in a statement saturday that @entity3 's referendum conforms to international law
@entity52 nations and the @entity27 have announced some targeted punishments against @entity5 and have threatened tougher sanctions if the secession vote goes through , as now appears likely
is the referendum legal ? ' @entity5 is an opportunity ' at a polling station in @entity93 , near a military base , a steady stream of voters arrived to cast their ballots despite the wintry weather
blaring dance tunes and @entity5 folk music welcomed them to the polling station , in an echo of @entity103 times
what appeared to be a group of @entity5 soldiers -- without identifying insignia but with @entity5 license plates on their vehicles -- stood nearby
one voter , @entity110 , told @entity111 , " i 'm for restoring @entity3 to @entity5
returning what @entity112 took away
" the @entity30 peninsula was part of @entity5 until @entity103 leader @entity112 gave it to @entity4 in 1954
@entity4 was then part of the @entity103
another voter in @entity93 , @entity118 , said he would never vote for the government in @entity120
" i want us to join @entity5 , and live like @entity5 , with all their rights , " he said
@entity123 said she also had voted to join @entity5 , which she sees as being " spiritually close " to @entity3
" for me , @entity5 is an opportunity for our @entity3 to develop , to bloom
and i believe that it will be so , " she said
but @entity4 's prime minister @entity125 , speaking in @entity120 , dismissed the referendum as illegitimate under @entity4 and international law and improperly run
he said @entity4 authorities had information from @entity3 about voting irregularities , including people who are not @entity3 citizens casting ballots , the absence of proper monitoring and the presence of armed men
@entity138 , the head of the @entity139 , said there was no information that people with foreign passports were voting in the referendum
he also said no " provocations " had been reported at polling stations
@entity111 analyst and @entity5 journalist @entity148 similarly stressed that sunday 's vote was in no way staged
" when you look at the celebrations , you ca n't doubt that these people really are very happy , " he said
double voting ? in @entity24 , voters filed into a polling place , picked up white and yellow ballots and headed to private booths to fill them out before dropping them through the slits of clear ballot boxes
in another polling station , the vast majority of ballots dropped in the boxes appeared to be marked in favor of joining @entity5
some 80 % of voters turning out at a polling station in @entity170 were not on the electoral roll , the registrar told @entity111
those not on the roll have their passports and papers checked to establish identity
on the spot , election staff decide , with a show of hands , whether to allow those voters to participate
a @entity111 team photographed one voter dropping two pieces of paper into the ballot box , raising questions over how effectively the vote is being monitored
turnout was high , but many @entity189 , an ethnic @entity191 group with deep roots on the peninsula , were boycotting the vote , as were many ethnic @entity4
tatars , who make up about 12 % of the @entity3 population , have faced severe persecution in the past , when @entity3 belonged to @entity5
on saturday , representatives issued a statement recognizing @entity4 with its present borders , which would include @entity3
they asked the @entity4 parliament in @entity120 for more legal protection for their ethnic group
much @entity206 propaganda has been in evidence in the run - up to the referendum , both on the airwaves and in the form of campaign posters showing the @entity3 painted with either a @entity215 swastika or the @entity5 flag
@entity32 has insisted it has the right to protect ethnic @entity5 in @entity4 , who it claims are threatened by radical nationalists and " fascists
" could @entity222 go in the same way as @entity3 ? @entity5 squeeze pro-russian troops remain firmly in control of the @entity30 peninsula
@entity4 and the @entity228 insist the soldiers belong to @entity32 , but the @entity230 vehemently denies it , saying they are @entity3 " self - defense " forces
@entity4 's acting defense minister @entity233 said sunday that @entity4 had reached an agreement " with the @entity5 side " that @entity5 forces will allow the delivery of food and basic supplies to @entity4 military bases in @entity3 until friday
the bases have been blockaded for days
@entity233 told a @entity243 meeting that there are now 21,500 @entity5 troops on @entity3 soil
@entity5 is entitled to station 25,000 troops at its leased @entity249 naval base -- but the question is where those troops are
@entity233 also said @entity4 troops and equipment are being moved into @entity4 's east and south , in line with where @entity5 military forces are located
@entity32 has been carrying out mass military exercises not far from @entity4 's eastern border
@entity5 tightened its military grip on saturday within @entity4
about 60 @entity5 troops in six helicopters and three armored vehicles reportedly crossed into @entity4 's @entity266 region and were in the town of @entity268 , on a strip of land just northeast of @entity3
the region is key to neighboring @entity3 , because it gets electricity , fresh water and natural gas from there
the @entity5 said they were in @entity266 to prevent a possible terrorist attack on oil assets , according to @entity4 border guards
@entity279 chancellor @entity278 criticized @entity5 activities in @entity266 in a phone call with @entity35 on sunday , according to a statement from her office
she urged an increase in the presence of observers from the @entity287 , so they can quickly be sent to contested areas , especially in eastern @entity4 , and called on @entity35 to talk to the government in @entity120
the @entity230 's readout of the phone call said the pair had " constructive " discussions on sending an @entity287 observer mission to @entity4
@entity35 also voiced concern that " radical groups " in league with @entity120 were stirring up tensions in eastern and southeastern @entity4 and argued that the @entity3 referendum is legal , it said
@entity4 's @entity243 said sunday it had asked for a new @entity287 diplomatic monitoring mission to be sent to @entity4
a military observer mission is currently in the country but has been prevented from entering @entity3
@entity111 team in @entity3 : this is a @entity306 to remember what happens next in @entity3 ? if the vote goes in favor of joining @entity5 , as it looks like it will , @entity3 's government will declare its independence and ask @entity32 to let it join the @entity5
@entity5 lawmakers have said they 'll vote on the question on friday
@entity314 , a former @entity27 ambassador to @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 , described sunday as a bad day for @entity320 relations
" @entity35 has left our president with no choice
he needs to impose sanctions
i know @entity35 will come back and impose his own , " he said
" i think the end of this is going to be to cast @entity5 out into the cold
and the problem is , i do n't think @entity35 really cares
i think this is where he wants to take @entity5
" in @entity24 and other places with @entity5 majorities , blue , white and red @entity5 flags have dominated the streets
in the coastal @entity3 town of @entity249 , concerts on the main square have been celebrating the return to the " motherland " this past week
" everybody believes the results are already rigged , " said @entity342 from @entity120
" people are concerned what is going to happen after the referendum , " she said
" people are concerned that the @entity5 army will use force , guns to push ( the ) @entity4 army from @entity3
" in the city of @entity222 , near the @entity5 border in eastern @entity4 , @entity206 demonstrators stormed the prosecutor 's office , forcing their way through a door of the building
the activists are demanding the release of @entity363 movement leader @entity362 , who was arrested on march 6 for leading an occupation of the regional administration office
earlier , thousands of @entity206 demonstrators gathered for a second day in a central donetsk square before marching through the city
riot police stood on guard outside the offices of @entity4 's security service and the regional administration
addressing the @entity243 meeting , acting interior minister @entity373 said small rallies in @entity222 and another nearby city , @entity377 , had ended
about 4,000 pro-russian protesters have gathered for a third rally , in @entity380 , he said
deja vu about @entity382 in @entity4 ? not exactly opinion : can west make @entity35 blink ? opinion : @entity52 must check the @entity35 doctrine map : why the @entity73 and @entity27 are out of step on @entity5 sanctions @entity3 : echoes of history on road to @entity392
