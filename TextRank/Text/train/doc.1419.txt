@entity0 -- coal slag heaps up to 450 - feet high may not seem the obvious candidates to join a list that includes the pyramids of @entity6 , the @entity7 , and @entity8
but the remnants of a once - thriving mining industry in northern @entity11 have now been included in a roll call of the world 's greatest landmarks
the @entity15 has been designated a @entity16 by the @entity18 's cultural organization , @entity17 , and is now ranked alongside nearly 1,000 sites across the globe considered to have outstanding value
@entity22 was extracted from the region from the 17th to the 20th century , when it suffered an economic slump
now , after a 10 - year campaign , locals are aiming to promote as tourist attractions the old pits , railway stations , workers ' estates and mining villages
" it 's important as a piece of history in that part of the world , " said @entity17 spokesperson @entity33
" it does n't have to be pretty ... but it does have to be of outstanding universal value , in other words important for the whole of humanity
the locals have been so excited about this
this is a site they are very appreciative of , " she said
in its summary , @entity17 said the mining region was a " remarkable cultural landscape " and provided " exceptional testimony to the exchange of ideas and influences regarding the extraction methods used for underground coal seams , the design of worker housing and urban planning , as well as the international human migration that accompanied the industrialization of @entity62
" the @entity64 meets once a year to implement the convention defining the kind of natural of cultural sites that can be considered for the prestigious list
the @entity71 basin is one of three mining sites that made the list this year
among the 26 additions for 2012 were the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , the @entity80 fossil site in the @entity82 province of @entity83 , the decorated farmhouses of @entity85 in @entity86 and the @entity87 at @entity88 in @entity89
nominations for heritage status have to meet the @entity17 criteria agreed by member states and come up with a long - term management plan before they can be scrutinized and judged
however , heritage status does not necessarily guarantee protection
@entity17 director - general @entity97 said news that mausoleums in @entity100 , @entity101 , had been destroyed by @entity103 militants was " extremely distressing " and called on all parties involved in the conflict to " protect this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations
" in 2001 the @entity108 destroyed part of another of the world 's treasures -- the huge @entity114 statues in the @entity115 on the ancient @entity116 in @entity117
both of these sites are included on a list of 38 sites that are threatened .
