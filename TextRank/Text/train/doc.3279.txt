-- maj. @entity1 , the first @entity2 officer , rose through the ranks beginning his career from @entity5 to the @entity6
during the @entity7 , he became commander of a machine gun platoon , to the shock of his men who had never before seen a person of @entity16 ancestry
some even questioned his loyalty as @entity19 forces were battling @entity16 forces , which had joined the conflict on the side of @entity23
in a november 1950 clash , @entity1 and his men were outnumbered in a surprise attack by @entity16 forces
his actions there and in another clash would earn him a bevy of military honors , including the second highest military decoration , the @entity33
@entity1 , at age 88 , died in @entity35 , believed from what appears to be a heart attack monday , according to close friend , @entity38
long after his retirement from military service , @entity1 was always fit and a natty - dresser like a true @entity41 , @entity38 said
well into his 80s , he still fit into his uniform from 1953 , she said
@entity1 was born in @entity45 , @entity46 , a son of @entity16 immigrants
eager to fight in @entity5 , @entity1 joined the @entity19 @entity41 in 1944
" people said that 's the worst branch of the service
they 're the first in , last one out
he was like , ' that 's where i want to be
' " @entity38 recalled @entity1 telling her
instead , he was based at the @entity58 in @entity59 as a language instructor
when the @entity7 started in 1950 , @entity1 got his chance at the battlefield
he had arrived in @entity63 , @entity23 that september along with @entity65 troops , in an effort to retake the @entity67 from @entity69 forces
by november 1950 , the @entity16 army entered the war on the side of the @entity69 in @entity23
inside his unit , @entity1 faced racial slurs like " @entity16 laundry " or " the chinaman
" but the source of his discrimination proved to be crucial in saving the lives of his fellow @entity41
@entity1 's unit came under sudden attack on november 2 , 1950 , his company had their first encounter with the @entity16 forces
heavily outnumbered by the @entity16 forces and their firepower , @entity1 's unit was stuck until the gunfire stopped
" it was eerie , " said @entity1 , describing the battle scene to a @entity90 's documentary " @entity91 : breakout at @entity93
" " the @entity41 did n't know where the enemy was
" @entity1 struck out solo , trying to provoke enemy fire so his men could determine where the @entity16 forces were hiding
he went out alone firing sporadic shots to make it seem like the @entity41 were advancing
the @entity16 began returning fire , exposing their position
when @entity1 reached the outpost where the @entity16 forces were hiding , he employed a ruse no one in his unit could 've done
" do n't shoot ! " he yelled
" hearing @entity16 confused them and the temporary distraction proved crucial as the @entity41 launched a counterattack
looking back on his war experience , @entity1 told the @entity109 in 2010 , " certainly , i was never afraid
perhaps the @entity16 are all fatalists
i never expected to survive the war
so i was adamant that my death be honorable , be spectacular
" he earned a @entity33 for his actions
" i have told ( @entity1 ) many times , thank @entity120 we had him , " said @entity114 who served as a rifleman in @entity1 's unit in the @entity118 documentary
although injured , @entity1 returned to the battlefield
he led a mission to rescue a company of @entity41 overwhelmed by @entity16 forces
on december 1 , @entity1 guided his @entity41 in the frigid cold and through rocky hills to rescue them in the battle of the @entity93
he was awarded the @entity129 for his action
his citation read that " he contributed materially to the success of the epic night march of his battalion which resulted in the relief of the isolated @entity41 unit and the securing of vital ground
" " his exploits in @entity23 were numerous
he was very successful in holding open a pass to allow our people to escape from the @entity93 , which is probably one of the greatest feats of military maneuvering in @entity23 , " said his friend , @entity142 , 91 , who served in @entity5 but he was not a boastful man , friends say
when asked what he was most proud of , @entity1 did n't talk about breaking down racial barriers or his experience in the @entity7 , said @entity38
" what he 'd say is , ' i am most proud of being able to train future generations of @entity41
@entity1 went on to serve in the @entity6 and received a @entity157 with gold star
@entity1 had a sense of humor and always shared his opinion , @entity38 said
living in @entity35 , he and @entity38 would drive around to various grocery stores searching for his favorite @entity16 mooncakes with lotus seed and double yolk -- which he savored
people we 've lost in 2014
