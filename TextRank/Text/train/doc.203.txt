@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 are the kind of customers the government needs to make @entity8 work
the chefs own and operate a bright orange hipster magnet called the @entity11
the farm - to - table vehicle stands out in @entity0 , @entity1 , even among the new gastropubs that dot the city 's charming @entity14
today @entity3 and @entity4 are zooming around their rented kitchen on the edge of town , preparing deep - fried @entity21 sprouts , @entity22 with seaweed and pumpkin sweet rolls
they wo n't have time after their 12 - hour work day to explore the new health insurance marketplaces that opened this morning , but they look forward to seeing what @entity8 can offer them
and that 's good news for health care insurance companies
young and fit people like @entity3 , 31 , and @entity4 , 28 , have to buy into the system to support the law 's mandate that all people must have health insurance next year
under @entity8 , companies can no longer deny policies to people with pre-existing conditions , and some 48 million @entity46 are uninsured , according to the latest @entity48 figures
what insurance companies will save on medical costs for the healthier population will help pay for the older , sicker people who are entering into the insurance market for the first time
but because they 're young -- and do n't foresee getting sick any time soon -- some @entity57 may decide to skip insurance and risk paying a fine
@entity3 and @entity4 have health insurance now , but it 's pricey and " it covers nothing , " @entity3 said
she has n't been to the doctor in years and shells out about $ 200 a month
her policy does n't cover prescriptions either
" if it 's not generic , i ca n't afford it
" she says her family warned her about this when she left her teaching job in @entity70 to follow her passion for cooking
" one of the first things my parents said was that i was really going to miss that good health insurance , and they were right
i 'm healthy , but i really do , " @entity77 said
" ultimately , though , it 's worth it
... this does n't feel like work to me
i love what i do
new insurance will make this even better
" the owners of @entity11 met in 2011 when they enrolled in the culinary arts program at @entity87 in @entity70
the two chose to move to @entity1 after working under well - known chefs in @entity90
the foodie fast lane , they decided , was n't for them
when they scanned the country for opportunities , the food trucks in their @entity94 neighborhood inspired them
why not bring a slice of the @entity94 to @entity0 , where @entity4 got his first taste of cooking in the kitchen of his @entity103 - born grandmother ? they were true foodie pioneers
@entity3 says the people of @entity0 welcomed their @entity107 take on old @entity109 favorites , but when it comes to health insurance they may have been better off somewhere else
@entity1 ranks near the bottom in the nation when it comes to access to care and health outcomes , according to the latest edition of @entity118
while @entity8 is federal legislation , the @entity119 ruled that states could decide how they would handle the implementation
leaders in @entity1 have been downright antagonistic to the legislation
" just because the @entity119 says something is constitutional does n't make it constitutional , " one @entity1 state senator , who introduced an @entity126 bill this year , told the @entity127
the senator 's bill failed , as did others -- one of which would actually have made it a crime for a state or federal official to implement any provision of @entity8 -- but the state did successfully refuse to expand @entity141
it has not set up its own health care marketplace
@entity8 exchanges 101 : what you need to know " we do n't talk politics around here because there goes half our client base , either way , " @entity4 said while mixing the base for the @entity22
" but politics aside ... we need something better than what we have
" for the more than 726,000 people in @entity1 without insurance there are parts of the federal legislation that will help them
many will be able to buy policies through the federal health insurance marketplaces
and many , such as the chefs of @entity11 , will be eligible for tax breaks and subsidies to help them pay for any policies bought through these marketplaces
the policies themselves will also be much more comprehensive
all health insurance plans will now have to cover preventative health care and at least nine other kinds of care , including hospitalization , outpatient care , emergency services , mental health and substance abuse care , maternity and newborn care , prescription drugs , lab tests , rehab , and pediatric care
premiums will vary depending on the depth of coverage
out - of - pocket costs for an individual are capped at $ 6,350

health care coverage could come in handy right now for @entity4
he struggled with a double ear infection for weeks
a doctor at the local urgent care center told him ear drops would cost him $ 130 ; he paid to avoid permanent damage to his ears
now he has a sinus infection
unfortunately , even if he were to buy insurance through the exchanges today , the policies wo n't kick in until january
not having insurance , they say , is not an option -- even if the fine would be a lot cheaper than the least expensive policy option
" i think of this as an investment in our future health care , " @entity3 said
" most of the younger people we hear object to @entity8 are looking at the present and how it affects them now
we are relatively healthy , but in a few decades we will likely need medical attention
" " we feel optimistic it will be something that can work better for us health wise and be affordable , " she continued
" that would be a beautiful thing
