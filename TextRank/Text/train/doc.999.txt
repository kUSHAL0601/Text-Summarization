@entity0 , @entity1 -- two blasts went off wednesday as the governor of @entity6 province was headed to @entity7 to take part in the funeral for president @entity11 's half - brother
the remotely - detonated mine explosions in @entity7 's @entity15 district wounded two soldiers but the @entity6 governor , @entity17 , was unhurt , his office said
@entity18 , the @entity7 provincial council chief , was killed tuesday by a guard during a gathering at his house a day earlier
he was laid to rest wednesday , with the president in attendance , said @entity24 , a @entity7 lawmaker
@entity25 , a member of the @entity7 provincial council , told @entity2 he and others were with @entity11 when a guard named @entity29 came into the room and asked to talk to him
the guard then " takes @entity31 to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand , " @entity25 said
the shooter was shot dead by other guards
@entity29 was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for @entity11 for eight years , @entity25 said
he was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen
the @entity42 claimed responsibility for the shooting , saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them
@entity11 suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest , said @entity50 , the head of @entity51
" my brother @entity18 was killed today , " said the @entity1 president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting @entity55 president @entity54
" the @entity1 people have suffered a lot
every @entity1 family has suffered
i hope one day these sufferings end
" @entity18 , who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations , had been the subject of @entity64 cables leaked last year
without being prompted , he discussed the accusations with a senior @entity67 diplomat , according to one of the cables
he said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing
" he is willing to take a polygraph anytime , anywhere to prove his innocence , " the cable said
" he suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin , which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation
" a @entity67 official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of @entity7 's provincial council , " he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker
" he said @entity11 's " reputation for shady dealings " should be considered when he recommends " costly infrastructure projects
the official said dealing with people like @entity18 represents a major challenge in @entity1 : fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves
@entity11 " appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities , and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign , particularly relating to his influence over the police , " the author of the first cable said
journalist @entity111 contributed to this report .
