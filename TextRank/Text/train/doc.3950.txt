@entity0 -- a federal judge in @entity0 sentenced three men to a minimum 25 years in prison on wednesday for plotting to detonate bombs at two @entity7 synagogues and attack a military base in @entity0
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were arrested in 2009 after planting what they thought were live explosives
@entity15 , a fourth member of the group who was arrested and tried together with the defendants , was not in the courtroom pending a psychological evaluation
in august , the jury spent six weeks listening to the testimony and undercover tapes from an @entity24 informant who posed as a @entity26 militant
after eight days of deliberations in october , the defendants were convicted on seven of eight counts , including conspiracy and attempts to use and acquire weapons of mass destruction and anti-aircraft missiles
@entity34 and @entity11 were also found guilty of attempting to kill officers and employees of the @entity37
in an emotional statement on wednesday , @entity34 apologized to the people of @entity37 , his family and friends
" i have never been a terrorist and i never will be a terrorist and everyone here knows that , " he said
@entity11 and @entity10 also apologized to their families and thanked supporters , and @entity10 apologized to the people of @entity49
the prosecutors were pushing for life in prison for the three men
" what these three defendants did was as serious a set of offenses as is imaginable , " said assistant u.s. attorney @entity53 in court wednesday
members of the defense team argued during the trial that their clients were victims of entrapment
the original sentencing was postponed from march 24 so the judge could hear defense arguments on the government 's usage of a confidential informant in the case
" the real crime in this case is that the government was allowed to do something like this , " @entity71 , attorney for @entity10 , said after the sentencing
lawyers for the three men have said they will appeal
@entity37 district judge @entity77 admonished the defendants for what they tried to do , calling it " beyond despicable , " yet she handed down the minimum sentence , calling the defendants " thugs for hire , " not religious or political martyrs
she praised the " brilliant lawyering " in the case and the defense for dedication to their clients
" @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity10 voluntarily agreed to target synagogues and military planes using what they thought were real bombs and missiles , " said @entity92 @entity37 attorney @entity91
" today 's sentences ensure that the defendants will be punished for their actions
