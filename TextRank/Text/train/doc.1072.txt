-- an infant falls to his death from a second - story window while his parents are making love
@entity7 and @entity8 star in the @entity10 drama " @entity11
" the mother ( @entity7 ) is consumed with grief and guilt
she 's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband ( @entity8 ) , a therapist , insists she return home
he gets rid of all her medications
he will be her partner and her grief counselor , and he will see her through this , if only she will place her trust in him
not a good idea for either of them , as it turns out
@entity23 is nearly upon us , but " @entity11 " is a mighty strange kind of horror movie , a wrenching psychodrama for two - thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act
the movie 's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words : @entity10
the @entity39 provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the @entity41 ( with " breaking the @entity48 " and " @entity49 " ) and re-energized @entity43 art cinema in the 1990s with the @entity47 movement 's so - called " vows of @entity45
" it 's not often that an art - house director takes up the implements to make a horror film , and for a while , " @entity11 " compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices , not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman , neither of whom is named
the prologue -- the child 's death -- is a luxurious , slow - motion rhapsody of explicit sex , black - and - white photography and baroque music , commingling with the infant 's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close - ups of the family 's washer - dryer
( there may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in @entity81 's " @entity84 , " a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural
) @entity8 and @entity85 are riveting as the ill - matched couple
he 's an implacable rationalist , urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche
she 's not sure he 's ready to share that torment with her
their bitter , sometimes sourly funny back - and - forth fleetingly echoes the railing , pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in @entity100 and @entity101
of course , when those great @entity106 dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail , their only weapons were words
mindful that he 's up against " hostel , " " @entity116 " and the like , @entity114 ups the ante considerably
hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife 's fears ( it could be anywhere , but let 's imagine we 're in the neighborhood of @entity129 ) , the doctor 's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and , uh , worse
it 's safe to say @entity10 knows this climax is over the top : " @entity134 reigns ! " announces a fox , in perfect @entity136 , just as the movie goes off the deep end
chaos reigns all right , and @entity85 's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch - bitch
this director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously , in my opinion
but this time the boot is on the other foot , and for once the charge seems to stick ; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests @entity8 's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance
apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the @entity159 recently
when i caught up with it at the @entity163 two weeks ago , the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek i 've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when @entity85 gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto - surgery
there also was a very vociferous walk - out : a gentleman who fairly barked " you get what you pay for , folks " as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end
that unhappy camper had a point
either @entity10 is barking up the wrong tree , or he 's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that 's seen it all before and still demands more , more , more
beautifully shot by @entity184 and acted with raw conviction , " @entity11 " is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker , nothing more and nothing less
if you do n't believe me , go ask the talking fox
" @entity11 " is not rated and runs 104 minutes
