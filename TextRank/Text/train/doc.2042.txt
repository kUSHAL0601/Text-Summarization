-- @entity1 says her new album is " very positive " but admits that it started out " a lot heavier and a lot darker " because of the separation from her husband , @entity5
" i 'm separated from my husband right now , which has been a very difficult thing to go through , " she told @entity8 's " @entity9 " podcast
" in the beginning , the album was a lot heavier and a lot darker , because i had to get that out
once i did get that out , a lot of fun came
" @entity19 married @entity5 , a former pro hockey player , in 2010 after dating for three years
their son , @entity20 , was born in 2012
@entity19 and @entity5 announced their separation in january

her just - released single , " @entity29 , " is from her still - untitled album , which will be her first studio release since 2007 's " @entity28
" she says she first started thinking of new material when she was pregnant with her son
after having the child and taking another year , she was even more anxious
" i felt like i was missing a big part of myself , " she said
@entity19 established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular @entity37 show , " @entity38 , " which aired from 2001 to 2004
she spent most of her teenage years touring and says that turning 20 was a big factor in leaving the road
" it was time for me to be a person , and the break just ended up being a long time , " she said

@entity19 is upbeat about her music 's prospects
" it 's an exciting new journey for me , " she said .
