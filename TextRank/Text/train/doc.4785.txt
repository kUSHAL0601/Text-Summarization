-- the government 's open
@entity2 is back at work
@entity6 , licking their wounds , are asking themselves what 's next
and president @entity8 has thrown down the gauntlet : the top item on his agenda is immigration reform
what are the chances that the @entity6 will now move ahead on immigration ? the answer will have less to do with immigration than with how the budget battle has changed the larger political dynamic in @entity2
@entity6 @entity21 ' views on immigration are untested , and many advocates for reform believe they are implacably hostile
but the truth is @entity27 opinion has been evolving since the 2012 election
more and more @entity21 , perhaps the majority , know that reform is overdue and that the @entity27 must be part of the solution -- to remain competitive with @entity34 voters and because it 's the right thing to do
individual lawmakers and essential staff continued to work on the issue even through the dark days of the shutdown
and members are coalescing around answers to the hardest of the hard questions : what to do about immigrants living in the @entity45 illegally ? @entity6 majority leader @entity46 is working on a bill that would create a path to citizenship for " dreamers " brought to the @entity45 illegally as children
and one recent informal count found 84 @entity6 -- more than one third of the total -- in favor of legal status for the @entity58 ' parents
bottom line : if it were n't for the rancor of the budget brawl , the @entity6 might be in a good place on immigration , with @entity21 ready to move forward and pass a package of measures they could send to a conference with the @entity69 bill
opinion : key to immigration reform -- worker visas so what exactly is the fallout from the budget battle ? surprisingly , it appears to cut both ways -- both for and against the prospect of an immigration overhaul
even before the government reopened , two different factions were making their voices heard
some , such as rep. @entity83 of @entity84 -- an opponent of the budget deal but a strong proponent of immigration reform -- argued that the budget battle had made it hard , if not impossible , for @entity6 to reach a deal with @entity8
others , such as rep. @entity92 of @entity93 , who voted for the budget package , said it 's time to get back to the give and take of governing -- time to sit down with @entity98 and compromise , including on immigration
opinion : it 's not @entity103 holding up immigration reform which of these two sentiments will prove stronger in the @entity6 ? @entity27 lawmakers are reeling from their recent drubbing
skepticism and negativity are at an all - time high
and it will take both kinds of champions -- tough - minded and accommodating -- to negotiate a deal
but if enough other republicans agree with @entity92 and make their views known , that could empower leadership to open the way to consideration of some immigration bills
a handful of hard - line conservatives -- the group that opposed the budget deal -- still hold enormous sway in the @entity6
and just because speaker @entity128 waived the so - called @entity130 rule once -- bringing the legislation that ended the shutdown up for a vote when he knew it lacked support from the majority of the @entity27 majority -- does n't mean he 'll do that again anytime soon
the @entity6 @entity27 conference is only as strong as it is cohesive , and the majority - of - the - majority rule has proved a good way to maintain that power and cohesion
still , the complex dynamic that drives @entity21 in the @entity6 may have shifted somewhat in the shutdown
certainly you hear a lot more grumbling , in private and in public , about the power of the hard - line naysayers
other members are tired of being held hostage
many want to get on with governing , making deals on a wide range of issues
and a few , such as @entity92 , are starting to say so , even on tv
opinion : how @entity8 can clinch immigration deal that 's a ray of hope
but there 's still another danger looming
the one thing @entity6 are not going to do in the wake of the budget battle -- not on any issue , in any circumstances -- is a favor for @entity8
and to the degree that immigration reform is seen as @entity8 's issue , it will be dead on arrival in the @entity6
the question for @entity6 , leadership and rank and file : do they want to cede the issue to @entity8 ? can they afford to let him own it ? more and more of the @entity27 grasps that that 's a mistake
it 's a disaster politically for the party and a mistake for the nation , which needs reform , urgently , for the sake of the economy and the rule of law
what 's needed in the @entity6 now is not a favor for @entity8 , but a strong conservative answer on one of the most vexing issues facing the nation
will @entity6 @entity21 see it that way ? can they take ownership and move forward ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .
