for those of you who do not have your calendars marked and gifts or cards purchased , a reminder : sunday is @entity6 , a " holiday " that many @entity8 have the luxury and good fortune to be able to observe
this year , the @entity11 estimates that @entity8 will spend around $ 18.6 billion on gifts for this one day -- even though most of us go through the motions of celebrating without having any idea about the day 's original intent
@entity6 can be traced back to @entity16 , and its aims were quite different from anything you 'll find today on a greeting card
in her @entity21 of 1870 , @entity16 called on her " sisters " to work to establish peace so that her son could return home from war : " in the name of womanhood and humanity , i earnestly ask that a general congress of women without limit of nationality may be appointed and held ... to promote the alliance of the different nationalities , the amicable settlement of international questions , the great and general interests of peace
" this year , i would like to ask that we -- mothers and everyone else -- reignite the spirit of common purpose that @entity16 sought to inflame in @entity8 , and direct it toward a silent wartime that is taking hundreds of thousands of women 's lives each year -- childbirth
the @entity53 estimates that some 360,000 girls and women die worldwide each year from pregnancy or childbirth - related complications
nearly all of these deaths are preventable
it 's not that they are preventable if we find a cure , and it 's not that they are preventable if we extend expensive lifelong treatment regiments
they are preventable if we extend very basic , known and trusted services : if we help women get to health care facilities in their time of need ; if we ensure that a skilled professional is available to oversee their labor and delivery ; if we provide access to family planning so that children are spaced
these goals are all within our reach , but only if we decide that women 's lives are worth saving
what does the issue actually look like worldwide ? opinion : global health within our grasp if we do n't give up while rates of maternal mortality are often highest in developing countries , particularly in @entity90 and @entity91 , in several of those countries we are beginning to see declines
startlingly , maternal mortality rates have been rising in @entity8
according to the @entity53 , the rate of women who died from pregnancy - related complications in the @entity8 increased by nearly 50 % from 1980 to 2008 -- a statistic that suggests this issue is one of equitable resources and education , not a lack of technology or infrastructure
two years ago , i made a documentary film , " @entity108 , " and founded an advocacy and mobilization campaign called @entity111
i did both to raise awareness and support for maternal and child health care
we are trying to draw attention to an underreported global problem that can be solved if only we come together to make it a priority
opinion : @entity6 is not so rosy in @entity90 our organization measures success by the actions taken to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health
the goal is 5 million actions by 2015 -- perhaps signing a pledge , running a @entity130 or even a marathon or donating an old cell phone so it can be used to facilitate communication and medical care in rural areas
our website , everymothercounts.org , suggests specific actions to take , many of them straightforward steps that help spread the word or raise resources for simple solutions
individually they may seem small but together , they can save lives
with that said , here is what we propose for @entity6 : a " @entity149
" our " proclamation " encourages mothers to join in solidarity to " disappear " for the day , out of solidarity with those who needlessly die in pregnancy and childbirth
we believe that in acting together , we can show just how much a mother is missed when she is gone we 're spreading the word with a film to get families across the country talking about this issue , so that next year , there will be more mothers and families who can celebrate @entity6 together
please join me at http://www.facebook.com/everymothercounts , for @entity149
because together , our silence will speak the loudest for all mothers .
