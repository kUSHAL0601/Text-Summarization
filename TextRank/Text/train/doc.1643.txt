@entity1 fighters from @entity2 have finally arrived in @entity3 in northern @entity4 to reinforce @entity5 in the battle against @entity7 for control of the town
a @entity1 activist in @entity3 said late friday he saw more than 100 @entity1 fighters known as @entity13 cross over the @entity15 border with their vehicles to the embattled city 's west , near a key hill called @entity20
another witness said he saw a large convoy of armed vehicles pass his house , headed toward the unofficial border crossing on the city 's western side friday evening
they were accompanied by @entity15 military , as they drove on the @entity15 side , he said
this is the largest reported crossing of reinforcements to help the the @entity5 defending the besieged @entity3
it 's unclear whether more help is on the way
@entity7 , the @entity36 , has been fighting to take @entity3 for about six weeks , hoping to add it to the territory it already captured in parts of @entity4 and @entity2 for what it calls its new independent @entity43 nation
word of the @entity13 's arrival follows complaints from @entity5 , accusing @entity15 of causing delays in the fighters ' arrival
the @entity13 were supoosed to arrive thursday night or friday morning , according to @entity54 , spokesman for @entity5 @entity1 fighters , part of the @entity53 , or @entity53
" we do not know why it is delayed
we think the delay is caused by @entity15 , " can said friday morning
" @entity7 has been focusing its attacks on the border gate for the past five days to prevent @entity13 and other support from coming , but they have not made progress
we have taken back some areas , " can added
@entity4 has been embroiled in a three - year civil war , with government troops battling @entity7 and other rebels elsewhere , leaving @entity3 's ethnic @entity5 to defend the city , with @entity68 airstrikes -- part of a larger @entity68 - led coalition effort against @entity7 in the region -- intermittently taking out @entity7 targets in the area
meantime , the airstrikes against those targets continued thursday and friday as part of @entity76 with four more carried out in @entity4 and @entity2 , @entity77 said in a @entity79 post
" separately , @entity68 and partner nation military forces conducted four airstrikes in @entity2 thursday and today using fighter and remotely piloted aircraft against @entity7 terrorists , " @entity77 said .
