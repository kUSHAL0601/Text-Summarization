asked thursday why president @entity0 has a hard time in @entity2 -- where his approval rating hovers around 40 % -- @entity5 sen. @entity4 said a big reason has to do with his race
" i 'll be very , very honest with you
the @entity12 has not always been the friendliest place for @entity14 , " @entity4 told @entity11 ' @entity10
" it 's been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader
" the three - term senator , who 's fighting for her political survival in a tough contest this fall , said the @entity12 can also be hard for women " to present themselves
" @entity2 cooks up spicy @entity26 race " it 's more of a conservative place
so we 've had to work a little bit harder on that , but you know , the people trust me , i believe
really they do , " she said
" trust me to do the right thing for the state
" the " number one " reason for @entity0 's unpopularity , she said , was the moratorium by the @entity0 administration on off - shore drilling following the @entity46 oil spill in 2010
" our state was furious about that , " said @entity4 , who 's the chairman of the @entity47
" when you shut down the whole gulf of @entity53 it puts a lot of people here at risk and out of business
" 7 times @entity5 wished @entity0 would go away responding to her comments , @entity2 gov. @entity59 furiously called her answer " remarkably divisive
" " that is a major insult by @entity65 to the people of @entity2 and i flatly reject it , " he said thursday on @entity63
" @entity0 's policies , which @entity4 supports , are unpopular here , and the other 49 states , because they are ill advised , liberal , and do n't work
" " his administration has also proven to be incompetent
trying to blame it on race is ridiculous , " he added
@entity73 , an editorial writer at @entity74 noted that @entity4 " declined to explain how she has been elected three times as a senator by such a collection of unwashed knuckle draggers
