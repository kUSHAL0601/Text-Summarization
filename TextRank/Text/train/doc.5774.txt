@entity0 -- lengthy sentences handed down to 21 women and girls who were arrested at a @entity6 demonstration have highlighted growing unease over the @entity10 authorities ' treatment of dissent
the protesters , including seven minors , were sentenced wednesday in @entity14 after being arrested at a demonstration in support of ousted president @entity17 earlier this month
the seven minors were sent to juvenile detention , and each of the adult women got 11 years in prison
their sentencing came amid demonstrations over a new protest law announced by the military - backed @entity10 government sunday
the new law requires organizers to seek permission from authorities before gathering and gives police the right to cancel demonstrations and to disperse them with force
it was put into use tuesday , when a demonstration of less than 300 people protesting an article allowing military trials of civilians in the draft constitution was dispersed with water cannon and tear gas on the grounds that organizers did n't seek permission beforehand
about 40 people were arrested
female detainees said they were sexually harassed during the arrest and then beaten before being dropped off near a desert road south of @entity0
twenty - four men remain behind bars facing numerous charges relating to the new protest law
about 2,000 demonstrated wednesday , in the second strong showing of dissent this month not connected to @entity17 supporters , chanting against the @entity57 , police and defense minister @entity59
" the cabinet ... declares its commitment to the firm and strong enforcement of the @entity64 to protest law ; the complete support to the police ; and its respect to freedom of expression within a regulated framework , " @entity66 , minister of higher education , said in an official statement wednesday
one student was killed thursday in clashes with security at @entity77
several were injured in university students ' demonstrations in @entity0 and @entity14
voting on the final draft of the constitution was postponed to next week , as discussions continue
some members of the constitution - drafting committee who are opposed to the use of force against protesters briefly suspended their membership
@entity92 demonstrations continue across @entity10 but with smaller numbers , because of an ongoing crackdown and the arrests of leaders and young members
' political verdict ' the sentences handed down wednesday in @entity14 have intensified concerns among rights groups about alleged abuses by police , apparently with the support of prosecutors and the judiciary
" we do n't have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings , which include the sentencing of several @entity117 students to 17 years in various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized , " said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups
a @entity121 official echoed those concerns
" i think the fact that this protest law passed is significant and is bad news because there was a lot of pushback against this law
we 've been pushing back against this law , and they were all oppressive , " said @entity129 , the group 's @entity10 director
" i think what this new protest law shows is that hard - line security agencies are the ones calling the shots , because the @entity137 wanted this new law to legitimize the crackdown on protests
" lawyer @entity141 , who is working on the case of the @entity14 women and girls , told @entity1 he is confident the sentences will eventually be overturned -- but not before they spend seven or eight months in prison or juvenile facilities
" it 's a way to punish the girls until a new verdict is out , " he said
he believes the charges for which they were sentenced , filed in a misdemeanor court , will ultimately end in a petty fine
" the verdict is political and does n't have legal grounds , " he said
the charges against the women include thuggery , congregating or gathering , weapons possession and destroying property
polarized political scene @entity17 , backed by the @entity57 and the nation 's first democratically elected president , was forced out of office in july , with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values
several hundred people have died in clashes between @entity6 demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him
@entity17 is in custody , facing charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last december
he has refused to recognize the court
in the months since @entity17 's ouster , many @entity10 accepted the force used against his supporters as attacks on police and the army in @entity10 's @entity187 region increased
but the recent emergence of a faint voice rejecting the polarized political scene is encouraging more criticism of the security sector
on the government level , reports indicate an increasingly domineering role for the @entity137 in the decision - making process
with a frail economy , many citizens on the street do n't want the disruption brought by protests and so are willing to defend the heavy hand of the security forces
but at the same time , demonstrations in campuses across the country and workers ' protests are growing in number for a range of political and economic reasons
