@entity3 , @entity2 in a rare order thursday , all seven judges in @entity2 's @entity1 have recused themselves from the lawsuit filed by the parents of @entity8 against the @entity9 and a second action , filed by @entity4 against @entity11
the recusals come less than a week before the two - year anniversary of the discovery of @entity8 's body in the center of a rolled gym mat in the old gym at @entity19 on january 11 , 2013
@entity8 's parents , @entity21 and @entity22 , said they never believed investigators ' conclusion that their 17 - year - old son died while struggling to reach for a shoe at the center of the mat. they believe their son was murdered
months after an autopsy conducted by the state medical examiner supported the local investigators ' conclusion , @entity8 's parents hired a pathologist , who said he found evidence of unexplained , nonaccidental blunt force trauma to @entity8 's neck
in june 2013 , attorneys representing @entity21 and @entity22 sued the @entity9 to get access to the department 's full investigative file and a copy of school surveillance video recorded around the time @entity8 disappeared
according to the lawsuit , the department 's refusal to release the file was a violation of @entity2 's @entity51
chief judge @entity52 ordered the department to release the files and video several days after @entity4 joined the suit in october 2013
in november 2014 , @entity4 filed a lawsuit against @entity11 to get access to clones of hard drives containing the original recordings of surveillance video given to sheriff 's investigators
the lawsuit also claims the recordings are public record and the school 's refusal to release them constitutes a violation of the state 's @entity51
the dispute has not yet been resolved
" given the fact that officials with whom the judges in the circuit deal with everyday are involved , it is not fair to the parties for any judge in this circuit to rule on contested matters of importance to the parties and the community , " @entity52 wrote in a letter addressed to attorneys representing all parties
only five of the seven judges in @entity2 's @entity1 hear cases regularly
two senior judges hear cases only after special assignment
" his decision cuts to the very heart of this matter , especially for this family
that is : can they get fair and impartial people to look at what happened to this child and render a fair decision so they can have peace at night ? " said @entity8 's attorney , @entity98
@entity52 had mediated requests for records in the case for more than 18 months before thursday 's recusal
" while i had hoped that at least the preliminary matters would be dealt with through informal mediation , i do not see that happening , " @entity52 wrote
" the normal process for case assignment after judicial recusal will result in another judge being assigned to the case following which a hearing will be scheduled to decide the matters now before the @entity122 , " the @entity9 's attorney @entity112 told @entity4 in a written statement
an attorney representing @entity11 did not immediately respond to @entity4 's request for comment
" @entity2 is a big state
i think @entity126 is one of the major cities in @entity129 and i 'm sure there are a lot of judges for them to choose from , not only in @entity126 but throughout the @entity2
the hope is that you will find a judge who is as fair and impartial , " @entity98 said
@entity4 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .
