-- the other night , as i sat in the telescope operation room at the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , preparing with colleagues to measure light from some of the most distant galaxies known , the phone rang with startling news
an exploding star had been sighted in @entity13 , one of the nearest big galaxies
the " supernova " ( as such stellar explosions are called ) was a special , rare " @entity18 " -- the kind that led to the @entity21 - worthy discovery of dark energy
@entity18 supernovae have happened in our galactic neighborhood only three times in the last 80 years
like astronomers around the world , we were excited to be at a world - leading telescope , where we could collect new information about this rare event
the new supernova , @entity34 , is 11.4 million light - years from @entity35 , a mere stone 's throw in cosmic terms
the previous record - holders were found in 1937 ( 14 million light - years away ) and 1972 ( 16 million light - years away )
supernovae occur at the end of a star 's life when its furnace runs out of fuel
because gravity then overcomes the star 's ability to remain puffed up , there is a violent collapse , followed by an explosion that produces radioactive elements such as nickel and cobalt
most of the light we see from a supernova is emitted as those radioactive elements decay , so the brightness falls sharply over a period of weeks
incidentally , all the iron in your blood came from the decay of radioactive nickel manufactured in a stellar explosion
so most of the atoms in your body were once in the interiors of stars
because supernovae change brightness very quickly compared with galaxies ( months compared with billions of years for galaxies ) , we quickly diverted the @entity4 telescope from our intended targets to @entity34
our galaxies will look the same another night , but the supernova wo n't
amazingly , a professor and his students at the @entity83 had discovered @entity34 well before it reached its peak brightness
" the weather was closing in , with increasing cloud , " said professor @entity85
" so instead of the planned practical astronomy class , i gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the ccd camera on one of the observatory 's automated 0.35 - meter telescopes
" deciding to look at @entity13 was almost pure luck -- there were fewer clouds in that direction , and the galaxy was pretty and bright
but @entity85 quickly noticed @entity13 did n't look right : it seemed to contain a bright new star
he realized this might be a supernova and , together with his students , worked feverishly to rule out other explanations ( such as a flaw in the camera or an asteroid in our galaxy appearing to pass by @entity13 )
in short order , the discovery of the new supernova was confirmed , and the e-mail alerts and notifications began
@entity116 , one of the students , said , " one minute we 're eating pizza , then five minutes later we 've helped to discover a supernova
i could n't believe it
" the only supernova that 's more extraordinary is @entity122 , which was discovered in 1987
it is in a tiny satellite galaxy orbiting the @entity125 , about 160,000 light - years away and 70 times closer than @entity34
here 's an analogy for the vast distances across which we see supernovae : imagine if @entity122 were on the back porch
then @entity34 would be just down the street ; a garden - variety nearby supernovae would be in the next town , and the most distant supernovae would be over in the next state
space is very empty -- there are only a few big galaxies near us
on average , the distance to the nearest big galaxy is about 100 times its size
but space is also huge , and there are billions of galaxies
in an ordinary big galaxy such as the @entity125 , one supernova -- of any type -- happens only every hundred years or so
but since there are so many galaxies in the universe , millions of supernovae go off every year
from @entity35 , we can see hundreds of these
one recipe we can use to find a supernova is to take pictures of a few hundred galaxies , repeat a few weeks later and look for the difference
the supernova will look like an overly bright star compared with the galaxy in which it lies
finding one supernova in several hundred galaxies is equivalent to staring at one galaxy for several hundred years
@entity13 is an unusual galaxy because it has a high rate of star formation
that 's why two other supernovae were found in @entity13 as recently as 2008 and 2004
but they were not the special @entity18 supernovae
because we have a good idea of how much light is emitted by @entity18 , the brightness we observe is a direct indicator of the distance to the host galaxy
this makes @entity18 supernovae incredibly valuable for measuring cosmic distances
careful observations of @entity18 across the universe were essential to measuring the expansion history of the universe over billions of years
this led directly to the discovery of dark energy , a sort of fifth fundamental force that is now one of the most important unknowns in physics or astronomy
the reason @entity18 supernovae are special is their uniformity
basically , they all explode at about the same mass , so they are all roughly equally luminous
better understanding the physics of that explosion and the effect of local galactic environment will make @entity18 even better " standard candles " and improve our understanding of the properties of dark energy and the cosmological evolution of the universe
the more data we can get , and the closer the supernova , the better the calibration
we are lucky that @entity34 was discovered about two weeks before it will reach its maximum brightness , rather than after
for the next week or so , the data will get better as the supernova gets brighter
on tuesday night , it was reported to be 11th magnitude ( astronomer units ) , which is about 100 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye
but it should get at least 10 times brighter , with a maximum around 8th magnitude -- not visible to the naked eye but certainly discernible with a good pair of binoculars
@entity13 lies far north in the sky , in the constellation @entity230 , near the @entity231 , above the @entity231 's bowl and about a third of the way over toward @entity235 , the @entity236
so if you can see the @entity231 and the @entity236 , take a shot at seeing one of the most unusual supernovae in your lifetime
of course , you ca n't get too excited about the timing
we see this light 11.4 million years after the explosion happened , because of the time light takes to reach our galaxy
so it was a really special time in @entity13 11.4 million years ago
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .
