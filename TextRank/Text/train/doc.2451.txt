-- in december , @entity1 drove the 30 miles or so from his home in @entity3 , @entity4 , to deliver @entity6 gifts for his grandchildren
for @entity8 , @entity1 picked out an athletic top and pants
the teenager loved to ski and lamented to his grandfather the mildness of this winter in @entity14 , the unofficial snow capital of @entity4
if only @entity1 could hear @entity8 's voice again , see the smile that always slipped from his lips
instead @entity1 prepared tuesday to attend a vigil in @entity8 's honor
@entity21 , 16 , was one of three students who died in a shooting at @entity24 the day before
@entity26 , 17 , was declared brain dead early tuesday and @entity28 died tuesday morning , his family said in a statement distributed by @entity31 hospitals in @entity32
one other student remained hospitalized tuesday while a fifth victim has been released
their names have not been released
the students were shot monday in the school cafeteria
@entity8 and @entity26 were waiting for a bus that would have taken them 10 miles down @entity41 to the @entity42 , said superintendent @entity43
@entity8 was taking a class on the @entity45
@entity26 was enrolled in an alternative energy program
@entity43 spoke to @entity0 before it was known that @entity28 had died
@entity8 learned things like how to combine networks and infrastructure ability
his class even covered computer hacking
@entity26 's class built solar panels and windmills
the two began taking classes in august at the career center to augment high school courses
they were among the 368 high school juniors from 11 neighboring school districts
@entity1 's phone rang at about 9:30 monday morning
what he heard on the line knocked him back , and he struggled to steady himself
maybe , he thought , it was one of those school scuffles he always heard about on the news
he 'd worked as a wrestling coach at @entity69 for 30 years
kids , these days , he thought , were different
maybe @entity8 had been shot in the arm , he thought
but then came the news
@entity8 's mother , @entity74 , works as a nurse at @entity76
she had just finished the 7 to 7 shift and was on her way home when she was told to report to another hospital , @entity31 , nearly 45 minutes away
@entity8 's father , @entity81 , a boiler technician at @entity82 , had also just finished an overnight shift
neither would speak to their middle child again
they were " torn by the loss , " they said in a brief statement
" @entity8 was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him
" @entity1 remembered @entity8 as an introverted kid
he did n't talk much , but he had a wry sense of humor
recently , he 'd landed a part - time job at a bowling alley where he maintained the computerized pins
" he liked repair work , " @entity1 said
by tuesday afternoon , thousands of people had visited @entity99 pages honoring @entity8 and @entity26
many pledged to wear red , @entity14 's school color , in support of the shooting victims and survivors
such a beautiful life cut way too short
you will never be forgotten , " one poster to @entity8 's memorial page wrote
" my heart aches for your family
" @entity21 's funeral is to be held saturday
tuesday evening , @entity14 residents were scheduled come together for a prayer service at the @entity115 , near @entity24
they will remember the three who died
@entity26 's family asked that he be remembered " for who he was , a strong boy with a big heart
he will be missed by many
he was so full of life and we are honoring his wishes to help others by donating his organs
" @entity43 said @entity26 was more outgoing than @entity8 and very sociable
he built good rapport with his teachers and classmates and worked well in teams , @entity43 said
@entity132 posted a message about @entity26 , her first cousin , on her @entity99 page : " apparently the @entity135 had decided to call you home today
although i disagree with his decision , there 's nothing i can do to change it
there are no words to express this sudden loss -- i 'm shocked and wishing i was just in a bad dream that i 'm going to wake up from
life is not fair , you were taken from us far too soon ! " @entity26 's tribute page on @entity99 mentioned @entity28 , who was then on life support at @entity31
the family did not release a statement about his death until tuesday afternoon
" we are very saddened by the loss of our son and others in our @entity14 community , " they said
" @entity28 was a happy young man who loved life and his family and friends
we will miss him very much but we are proud that he will be able to help others through organ donation
" @entity164 , a @entity14 football player , told the @entity165 that @entity28 worked out often in the school gym
" he could do squat lifts really good , " @entity164 told the newspaper
" he showed up for a few football workouts , but i remember him having struggles with his grades
" other students who knew @entity28 said he often sat in the cafeteria with a few of the other shooting victims
@entity14 student @entity176 said the shooting suspect , described by students as a withdrawn boy named @entity180 , knew his victims
however , prosecutor @entity182 said tuesday that @entity183 told authorities that he shot at random
tuesday , community leaders spoke of healing
@entity24 was closed for the day
at @entity42 , @entity43 opened the doors but brought in grief counselors for students and teachers who needed to talk
and at his home in nearby @entity3 , @entity1 prepared to attend this evening 's remembrance of a grandson for whom he will never be able to buy @entity6 presents again .
