the @entity1 establishment won big during this year 's midterm elections , fending off far - right candidates in primary races who might have threatened the party 's bid to retake full control of @entity9
@entity1 leaders will have to keep an eye on a wide - open presidential primary , along with internal party fights at the @entity15 , @entity16 and gubernatorial levels
that could spread the party thin and leave an opening for conservative activists to pluck off establishment leaders with greater ease , particularly in congressional races as much of the attention shifts to the battle for the @entity15
conservatives , smarting from their losses this cycle , are already getting organized for 2016
and they came out of this month 's government spending fight furious that congressional @entity1 produced no tangible response to president @entity33 's immigration executive action and convinced that @entity1 are still ceding issues to @entity35 after the election
@entity37 , a conservative strategist and editor of the site @entity40 , said that now that @entity1 have control of @entity9 , " there 's nowhere to run , and nowhere to hide " for those who have n't kept their promises to the @entity1 base
" you can only fool most of the people some of the time , " he said
" every capitulation [ congressional @entity1 ] engage in , every primary they win by getting across the finish line and they do n't do what they 've promised — it becomes that much tougher for them to defend
" @entity53 , the former @entity1 @entity16 majority leader , said party leaders need to acknowledge the challenge they 'll face with the presidential race at the top of the ticket
" you have to go into it realizing what 's going on in the @entity1 presidential primaries will have some effect on the @entity15 and @entity16 primaries , " @entity53 said in an interview
" what they need to do — that they did well in 2014 , but they need to do even better this cycle — is reduce the number of open seats , and recruit solid contenders
" the dynamic underscores the competing priorities among @entity1 heading into 2016
establishment leaders view moderate candidates like @entity78 or @entity79 as their best shot at winning the presidency
but conservatives believe that type of candidate would only follow in @entity86 's path to a disappointing loss , and are pushing for bomb - throwers like sens. @entity89 or @entity90
the debate will play out at a time when republicans are vulnerable on @entity94
though they will hold majorities in both chambers , @entity1 face a daunting map in the @entity16 , where they 'll defend 24 seats in 2016 -- seven in states that @entity33 won twice
establishment @entity1 see a need for more centrist nominees to defend those states in particular , and yet those centrist incumbents — senators like @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107 — already have targets on their backs
@entity110 , spokesman for the establishment - friendly outside group @entity111 , said nominating strong candidates takes on added urgency because of the tough political terrain for @entity1
" i think [ candidate quality ] is very important , especially given the fact that we have the @entity16 and we 'll want to make sure that we maintain it — and we have a map with a lot of @entity1 senators who are up for reelection in purple or blue states that @entity33 won , " he said
the memory of @entity126 , the @entity127 @entity1 @entity16 candidate who created headaches for candidates up and down the ballot with his comments on rape and pregnancy in 2012 — and lost a winnable race — has n't faded from the minds of @entity1 strategists
they are wary that another fringe nominee could undermine the party 's shot at the @entity15 this year
building on lessons from that cycle and 2010 , national @entity1 this year decided to aggressively engage in primary fights to help nominate strong candidates , and the strategy brought the @entity1 great success
but their primary successes took huge amounts of resources from the establishment , both financial and human , and considerable message discipline across the @entity1
along with the @entity155 , the @entity154 and @entity111 all poured millions into primaries to defend incumbents and beat back conservative challengers
establishment strategists that engaged in primary fights this past cycle acknowledged with a wide - open , high - stakes presidential primary splitting attention and resources away from @entity15 and @entity16 primaries , conditions are ripe for an underfunded , insurgent challenger to slip through to the general
@entity169 , an adviser to a @entity171 - based super pac that helped sen. @entity172 fend off an unexpectedly tough challenge from the right , said incumbents this cycle should see @entity172 's race as a cautionary tale
fundraising " has to be a concern , " he said
" you have to raise a ton of money and make sure you have a strong political organization in your state , " he said
" they 're all going to require human capital , as well as financial capital , to win those races " in 2016
@entity1 strategist @entity190 , who advised the @entity155 last cycle and was sent to help @entity193 sen. @entity192 overcome an unexpectedly strong independent challenger , said on that front in particular , the presidential primary could make things tougher
" there 's gon na be a lot of competition for money , a money and time - suck is going to really have an impact on @entity16 and @entity15 candidates , especially challengers , " he said
indeed , @entity205 said the group again plans to engage heavily in primaries
but he acknowledged it will be tougher to raise the money
and there 's also the prospect that typically fringe candidates wo n't need the money to pick up traction , with a conservative presidential candidate offering them some lift
that could also complicate the party 's message downballot , if incumbents and establishment candidates are asked to answer for gaffes or controversial comments made by conservative candidates engaged in the presidential primaries
and having a conservative - vs. - establishment fight at the presidential level could force some downballot candidates to address some of the more policy issues they can typically skirt , like welfare reform or disaster relief , that could be problematic for a nominee in a general election
@entity37 said conservatives see that as a key advantage of the upcoming cycle
" we do have a net benefit of a presidential election , where you have prominent people at the top of the ticket discussing those issues and forcing some of those individual candidates downballot to go on the record , " he said
but @entity249 , a veteran @entity1 strategist with close ties to establishment groups and candidates , said that could be the @entity1 's " biggest challenge
" " our biggest concern is making sure that @entity1 and candidates are running their statewide programs — and not falling into the challenges of the presidential primary campaign trail , " he said
preparing for that potential is already underway
incoming senate majority leader @entity261 is in talks to launch a new super pac geared towards @entity16 races , likely to bolster the @entity155 and @entity111 in helping nominate strong candidates and engage in the general election fight
the @entity155 has met with the chiefs of staff of all incumbent senators up for reelection
but @entity272 groups say they 're recalibrating as well , preparing for what @entity273 president @entity273 called " real combat
" " it 's going to be real combat between the moderates and the conservatives in the party — it 's going to come to the surface in a pretty dramatic way , " he said .
