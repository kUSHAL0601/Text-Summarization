@entity0 -- in a pair of unrelated incidents , three suspects were apprehended at @entity0 - area airports within days of each other for attempting to smuggle $ 1.4 million worth of cocaine and heroin through customs , federal officials said friday
in the first incident , on october 30 , a woman was found with 30 pounds of cocaine hidden in wooden hangers and clothing , according to a news release from @entity18 's @entity0 field office
the woman , @entity20 , was selected for a routine baggage inspection upon her arrival from @entity23 at @entity24 , the agency said
in addition to the hidden cocaine , her clothing was soaked in liquid cocaine , it said
it put the value of the narcotics at more than $ 660,000
two days later , on november 1 , two men were taken into custody at @entity0 's @entity36 after heroin was found in their checked luggage , the agency said
@entity18 officers selected the two men , @entity42 and @entity43 , for an enforcement examination and found the clothing in their suitcases to be particularly heavy , the agency said
upon closer inspection , officers found packages of a brown powdery substance in some pants and shorts
in total , @entity18 officers seized more than 16 pounds of heroin contained in brick - like packages , the agency said
it valued the heroin at $ 744,000
@entity57 , @entity43 's defense attorney , said he thought his client might be able to get leniency in court if he is convicted
" in any drug case , if a person is charged with possession with intent to distribute , their sentence is 10 years , " @entity57 said
" i would expect the charge will have a minimum sentence of 10 years if he 's convicted
but there are other factors that permit him to get a lesser sentence
mr. @entity43 has no prior record
" the investigation has been turned over to @entity76 , the investigative arm of the @entity77 , which will handle the prosecution
@entity79 , spokesman for the @entity0 field office , told @entity1 that the agency held off announcing the arrests until it determined that the cases would not be harmed by making them public .
