-- @entity2 's passion for @entity4 robots might not follow computer logic , but it 's no secret
the stories are geek legends -- from repairmen building 20 giant autobots out of junk in a small village in @entity12 to the true romantic who spent 10 months building an eight - meter - high @entity14 to propose to his girlfriend
then there was the reality series that picked four @entity2 actors for minor roles in the upcoming " @entity20 : age of extinction , " a good part of which is supposed to take place in @entity2
it makes sense , therefore , that the @entity27 is being held in @entity28 this week
running june 1 to october 5 at the @entity30 , the new @entity29 showcases more than a thousand toys and collectibles in 10 different zones of the resort 's giant event space
features include a replica of @entity38 ( we 're told it 's the soul of a transformer ) and a laser grid to test visitors ' sense of balance
there 's also a 3d hologram and a seven - meter - tall likeness of @entity49 leader @entity14
a large number of the exhibits have been lent to the expo by two " super collectors " from @entity54 and @entity55
for anyone hoping to build up their own battalion of robots in disguise , the expo seems like a good place to start
anniversary keepsake figurines of @entity14 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 have been produced just for the exhibition and are being sold on site
those who want all five will have to keep coming back -- a different figurine is being sold every month
