it is , in the words of one frustrated official , " one of the biggest open crime scenes in the world
" and yet , 11 days after @entity9 was blown out of the sky by a suspected surface - to - air missile , the @entity6 investigators in charge of finding out what happened have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed to remain strewn across the enormous debris field
the latest setback came monday , when a 45 - person team of @entity6 and @entity19 experts , accompanied by monitors from the @entity21 , abandoned their effort to reach the site after hearing explosions and being warned of heavy fighting in the area
it 's the same thing that happened sunday
" we 're really sick and tired of being delayed , " @entity21 spokesman @entity28 told @entity31 's " @entity30
" " we all know there are still human remains out there exposed to the elements , number one , " he said
" secondly , it is one of the biggest open crime scenes in the world as we speak , and it is not secured
there 's no security perimeter around the 30 - or 35 - square - kilometer site
" according to unconfirmed reports from @entity50 rebels , @entity47 's military broke through to part of the crash site monday and had stationed armored personnel carriers and dug trenches there
" safe work of experts and observers is impossible , " @entity56 , the acting prime minister for the self - proclaimed @entity57 , said monday
the @entity61 and other countries have repeatedly called for a cease - fire to allow investigators a safe working environment at the crash site , which the @entity61 human rights chief said monday could be the scene of a war crime
the @entity71 government had struck a deal with rebels to allow unarmed international police officers to guard the site , but the fighting has made that impossible
" this is a contested zone
there is active fighting going on , " @entity79 , deputy commissioner of the @entity80 , said at a news conference monday in @entity82
" we are working on the basis that if it 's a permissive environment , we will go in , " he said
@entity28 said monday that investigators will try to reach the site again tuesday
" we will keep trying every day , " he said
a @entity31 crew joined the convoy that attempted to go to the crash site monday , but the media were stopped by armed men near @entity95
the forensic teams turned around not long later
other people were also fleeing the violence
one man said jets were flying over his home
" my little one is terrified , " the man said
identifying the bodies as of monday , 227 coffins bearing remains from the crashed plane had been sent to the @entity6 , where forensic investigators were working to identify them
of the 298 people killed in the crash , 193 were @entity6 , 43 were @entity71 , and 27 were @entity19
more than 200 forensics experts from all over the world are working at a @entity6 military base to identify the remains , according to @entity115 , who is leading the effort
investigators are n't sure how many sets of remains they have
only one victim -- a @entity6 man -- has been identified
" this will take weeks ; it will take months , " @entity115 said
experts are using a variety of approaches in their work , including dental records , dna analysis and fingerprints , he said
" we do n't just identify people from a photograph or from an item of property that may be on them , because there 's been countless mistakes , examples of mistakes where that 's happened in the past over the years , even small incidents , like car crashes , " he said
@entity146 role in conflict debated the fighting appeared to be moving southeast from @entity149 , a city about 30 miles ( about 50 kilometers ) northwest of the crash site
at least 13 people , including two children , were killed in fighting sunday in and near @entity149 , the @entity152 said
at least 332 @entity47 soldiers have been killed and nearly 1,300 have been injured since april 7 , according to @entity47 's @entity156 and @entity157 and law enforcement agencies
there is no known figure for the number of rebels killed
meanwhile , debate continued over @entity146 's role in the conflict
on sunday , the @entity166 released satellite images that it said showed @entity146 firing into @entity47
" we are putting out evidence to confirm the points that not only has @entity146 been providing the weapons across the border , including heavy weapons , but they have also now been firing artillery barrages across the border , " senior @entity169 adviser @entity168 said
@entity146 officials have denied arming the rebels
at a news conference monday , @entity146 foreign minister @entity180 said he hoped that deployment of an @entity21 observer mission at two checkpoints on the @entity146 - @entity47 border would clarify what was happening on the ground
@entity146 wants ' impartial ' @entity189 investigation @entity191 and @entity47 officials have said that a @entity146 - made missile system was used to shoot down @entity193 from rebel territory
@entity146 and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed @entity47 for the crash
on monday , @entity199 @entity198 said that what happened " may amount to a war crime
" " it is imperative that a prompt , thorough , effective , independent and impartial investigation be conducted into this event , " @entity198 said
@entity146 announced over the weekend that it had formed a team to join the investigation , state - run news agency @entity205 reported
it will be led by the deputy head of the @entity209 , @entity210
@entity180 called for an " impartial " investigation carried out with agreement from the @entity157
but @entity166 spokeswoman @entity213 said monday on @entity31 that the @entity191 has little faith in what @entity146 says
" the @entity146 have mastered the art of saying one thing and doing another , " she said
@entity146 foreign minister shrugs off sanctions the @entity191 will place new sanctions on @entity146 this week , @entity169 deputy national security adviser @entity221 announced monday without elaborating
representatives from @entity225 member states will meet tuesday to consider the proposals , according to the @entity225 website
the new proposals include sanctions on weapons , goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , access to @entity235 capital markets and on the export of energy technology from @entity235 to @entity146
@entity213 said monday that what happens next is up to @entity146
" we 're seeing a serious impact of just the sanctions we have put in place to date , " she said
" the @entity235 want to do more
we expect they 'll do more , " @entity213 said
" so the question for the @entity146 is , do they care about the economy and how it 's impacting their people , or are they just going to be in denial about what impact these sanctions are having ? " @entity180 said monday that the @entity146 government was n't happy about all the sanctions but that the country would overcome any economic difficulties and become more independent as a result
" we are only seeing the desire of our @entity258 partners to punish @entity146 , " he said
also monday , the @entity191 accused @entity146 of violating the 1987 @entity260 , citing cruise missile tests that date to 2008 , senior @entity166 and @entity169 officials said
" this is a very serious matter which we have attempted to address with @entity146 for some time now , " said a senior @entity166 official
@entity146 's suspected violation of the treaty was first reported monday by @entity266
" the 2014 compliance report of the treaty includes a determination that the @entity146 is in violation of its @entity260 obligations not to possess , produce , or flight - test a ground - launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers ( 310 to 3,417 miles ) , or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles , " a @entity169 official said , adding that they " have kept the @entity277 and our allies informed of this matter
" the violation was for cruise missile tests that date back to 2008 , prompting an administration review as to whether the tests are in violation of the 1987 treaty between the @entity191 and @entity146 banning medium range missiles
officials told @entity31 that @entity289 had called for senior - level talks , but insisted the situation was not related to the violence in @entity47
what you need to know about @entity146 and sanctions @entity71 @entity297 's ' quiet diplomacy ' who are @entity47 's @entity299 rebels
