@entity0 hundreds of people gathered saturday to show their support for law enforcement following nationwide protests of controversial police incidents in @entity7 , @entity8 ; @entity9 and other areas
the group endured cold temperatures at the @entity13 in downtown @entity0 and marched more than a half dozen blocks toward a " @entity17 " rally at the @entity16
organizers put together the event to try to counter some of the anti-law enforcement sentiment expressed in the nationwide protests
@entity22 , former sergeant at arms for the @entity24 , told the crowd that " of 40 million encounters police will have with the public , 98.5 percent " of them are " good and great , " and said cops should empathize with minority groups , who sometimes complain about their treatment at the hands of police
" we all have something in common , " @entity22 said
" we ca n't forget who we are , and lose that in the job we have to do , which sometimes is very , very troubling , " @entity22 said
many speakers remembered loved ones killed in the line of duty
event co-organizer @entity44 , whose husband is a police officer , told @entity1 that all professions include some bad actors , but most police are " good officers " who put themselves in danger protecting the public
" my husband leaves every night and i never say goodbye , i say ' stay safe ' and ' i love you , ' because i do n't know if he 's coming home tomorrow
standing behind law enforcement officers is " long overdue , " @entity44 said
" our officers need to know that our nation supports them
" no charges after @entity60 police chief shot four times
