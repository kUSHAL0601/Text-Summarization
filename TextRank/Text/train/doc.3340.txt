officials wo n't say where @entity5 was buried , but family gathered at @entity8
their graves are public shrines for fans and followers
countless people from all over the world make pilgrimages to their burial sites , hoping to draw close to those they adored from afar
now @entity5 's gravesite will become the next holy grail
a private gathering for the pop icon was held tuesday at @entity8 in @entity22 , @entity23
afterward , his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the @entity26 in @entity27
but it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where
officials at @entity8 wo n't disclose where @entity5 's body is being buried
if his final resting place is at @entity8 , fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company 's stringent security patrols
a @entity39 official told @entity0 that the force hoped @entity5 would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months
there has been some speculation that @entity5 's body will eventually be moved to @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity23
but that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes , which could take years
@entity5 retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch
if a public memorial were created at @entity46 -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of @entity2 and @entity1 as the most - visited gravesite
" if it gets moved somewhere more public , i think a lot of people will come visit , " said @entity60 , author of @entity27 's @entity61 : where the @entity67 's rip
" he 'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over @entity2
" fame follows celebrities in life and in death
" there 's always a fascination with celebrities , but it 's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses , " says @entity74 , founder of @entity75 , a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens
" but once they are interred into the ground , anyone who wants to go can go
" @entity74 's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago , when he saw mobster @entity92 's grave in @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95
he and many others who are avid about visiting celebrity and historical graves dub themselves " grave hunters
" they seek the dead for various reasons
some go out of simple curiosity
many are fans who deeply admired the stars
some say they feel a connection to the celebrities by standing beside their graves
at @entity1 's @entity116 in @entity117 , guests visiting the grave can stay at the retro @entity118 and visit the museum to learn more about the @entity1
@entity120 and @entity93 in @entity27 houses @entity22 notables including sex symbol @entity2 and comic @entity123
the most recent celebrity to be buried there is actress @entity126 , who died of cancer last month
visitors can access the cemetery easily , and even tour buses drop by
" i 'm a product of that era , of @entity134 , " said @entity131 , a self - proclaimed grave hunter who visited @entity126 's grave a week ago
the 48 - year - old education administrator began searching for celebrity graves in the early 1970s
since then , she 's visited hundreds of celebrity resting places in @entity23
" i wanted to pay my respect
" at @entity120 , the most popular grave site remains @entity2 's
fans often decorate her grave with flowers and cards
her headstone is slightly darker than the others from so many fans touching it , grave hunters say
in @entity151 , the largest cemetery in @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity150 singer @entity3 's grave is tattooed with graffiti and artwork
@entity3 fans like to leave candles , poems and gifts as tokens of appreciation
at one point , fans were so rowdy that a stone block was put in place in an attempt to seal the grave from fans trying to unearth it
after unsuccessful attempts by @entity153 authorities to move the tomb to another site , security officers were placed at the grave
similar trouble plagued @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 , where members of the @entity181 were buried in the early 1970s
thousands of fans journeyed to visit the graves and party there , leaving behind cigarette butts and empty alcohol bottles
relatives fought to have an iron fence erected around the graves
some celebrity graves prove tempting to visitors , like that of heartthrob actor @entity193
his headstone in a public cemetery in @entity197 , @entity198 , has been stolen twice
@entity8 remains one of the most exclusive @entity22 burial sites
the staff is tight lipped , refusing to release the whereabouts of anyone buried there , except to family members
security cars constantly patrol the grounds
" we do n't advocate or promote any visitation out of respect for the privacy of the family , " said @entity209 , a spokesman for company
@entity217 officials would n't say whether @entity5 's body was , or could be , tucked into one of the cemetery 's locked gardens where celebrities like @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 are laid to rest
if @entity5 is buried in @entity8 , that wo n't stop fans and grave hunters from trying to sneak in , says @entity229 , a paralegal from the @entity231 area in @entity23 and an occasional celebrity grave hunter
" it 's going to keep @entity8 on their toes , " she said .
