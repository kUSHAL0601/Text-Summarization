-- i have smoked pot. not today or this week , or even this month , but i have
i 'm telling you this because before i begin talking about the pot - smoking habits of others , i thought it would only be right that i first owned up to my own past use
maybe this will encourage others to be a bit more honest because , like it or not , admitting to smoking pot is bound to get a lot less scandalous
three states -- @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- have marijuana legalization proposals on the ballot , and it wo n't be surprising if at least one of them passes
not medical marijuana , mind you , but the regulation and selling of small quantities for recreational use
if you thought @entity28 and @entity29 put @entity30 on the map , legal marijuana will make it out of this world
and i promise that will be my last pot joke , although being silly about pot illustrates why it 's taken this long for the country to begin adult conversations about marijuana , and not just knee - jerk rhetoric based on fear instead of facts
when president @entity46 signed the @entity47 , officially starting the so - called war on drugs , it was largely in response to pot - smoking hippies and @entity53 vets coming home addicted to heroin
@entity46 budgeted $ 100 million to fight what he called public enemy no. 1 -- illegal drugs
in 2010 , it was $ 15 billion
a trillion dollars has been spent on the war on drugs since it began
two government reports released last year had difficulty proving the billions being spent are making a big difference
in 1970 , the federal government listed pot to be more harmful than cocaine and meth
we now know that is n't true
that 's not to say legalizing pot is without risks ; it has been shown to impair concentration
but one study found alcohol was by far the most dangerous drug , followed by heroin and crack
@entity80 rated far down the list
so why do we continue to allow the @entity46 administration 's hatred of hippies to influence what we think about drug usage today ? i do n't know how much or how little tax revenue is actually going to come from state - sanctioned pot , but to me that 's not the point
the issue is n't how much money the government can make from pot sales , but rather , are the reasons why pot was originally classified as illegal still valid today ? now that we have studies that debunk the myth of longtime impairment from using pot , now that we see how ineffective the government has been in keeping pot off the streets , now that we have seen the gangland violence of drug cartels , should we still be looking at marijuana the way we did 40 years ago ? in the 1928 presidential election , @entity109 crushed his opponent , @entity111 , winning 40 states , in part because @entity111 was demonized as " the cocktail president
" @entity111 was in favor of repealing the 18th amendment -- prohibition -- while @entity109 believed he must enforce the law
it 's hard to imagine today , but alcohol was so vilified then there was an actual @entity122 dedicated to keeping it illegal
members even endorsed their own candidate for president
yet , just five years after that election , alcohol was legal
and even though @entity109 lost his bid for re-election , he did so supporting the repeal
that 's how quickly things can change
and that bit of history is what makes the results of these three states so fascinating
no one expects president @entity141 or @entity142 to come out in support of legalized marijuana within the next few days , but what will the conversation be like four years from now ? if the nation can go from upholding @entity117 to " drink up " in an election cycle , why could n't 2016 feature the first pro-pot president ? especially if next week 's results are , shall we say , favorable ? voting for a candidate solely because he or she lets you light up is stupid , but if all other things are equal , are we ready to vote to legalize marijuana the way our grandparents voted to legalize alcohol ? i think we are , but then one could say i 'm a bit biased
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .
