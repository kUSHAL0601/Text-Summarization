@entity0 -- preventing @entity3 from developing a nuclear weapon is a national security interest of both @entity6 and the @entity7 , president @entity2 said sunday in calling for continued diplomatic efforts but also pledging that all options -- including a military effort -- remain viable
" all elements of @entity7 power " remain an option to stop @entity3 from becoming a nuclear power , including " a military effort to be prepared for any contingency , " @entity2 told the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , a @entity18 lobby group
at the same time , @entity2 made clear that he preferred diplomacy over war both as a principle and in the case of @entity3 , and he warned that " too much loose talk of war " with @entity3 only benefits the @entity3 government by driving up the price of oil
the remarks came against a backdrop of growing international concern that @entity6 may attack an @entity3 nuclear facility
@entity6 and the @entity7 accuse @entity32 of seeking nuclear weapons despite the @entity3 regime 's insistence that its program is for peaceful purposes
@entity2 's speech was intended to allay concerns in @entity6 and in the @entity40 that he lacked commitment to support an @entity6 attack
the president stated his policy was not containment of a nuclear @entity3 , but preventing @entity3 from obtaining a nuclear weapon
at the same time , he emphasized that @entity3 " should not doubt @entity6 's sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs
" while @entity2 's position was consistent with his past pronouncements , his specific reference to preventing @entity3 from developing a nuclear weapon -- rather than the capability of building a nuclear weapon -- maintained what some consider to be a difference from @entity6 's position
@entity6 officials say that if @entity3 was able to enrich weapons - grade uranium , it would potentially cross the " red line " of nuclear weapons capability that @entity6 fears
prime minister @entity66 will meet with @entity2 on monday at the @entity67 to discuss that issue and others before speaking at the @entity17 conference
in a statement issued after @entity2 's speech , @entity66 expressed appreciation for the president 's position that all options were on the table to prevent @entity3 from developing a nuclear weapon
" i also appreciated the fact that he made clear that when it comes to a nuclear - armed @entity3 , containment is simply not an option , and equally in my judgment , perhaps most important of all , i appreciated the fact that he said that @entity6 must be able to defend itself , by itself , against any threat , " @entity66 said
to @entity88 , the president of the @entity89 who wrote the book " @entity91 of @entity3 , @entity6 and the @entity7 , " @entity2 ' s speech showed that a difference continues to exist between the @entity7 and @entity6 on @entity3
@entity6 " argues that the only acceptable guarantee that @entity3 does not get a nuclear weapon is for @entity3 to have no enrichment program , " @entity88 said in an email
" the @entity2 administration puts the red line not at enrichment -- which is permitted under international law -- but at nuclear weapons
this is a clearer , more enforceable red line that also has the force of international law behind it
" in his remarks sunday , @entity2 defended what he called his administration 's consistent record of supporting @entity6 economically , diplomatically and militarily -- including @entity7 military assistance and blocking anti-israel efforts at the @entity113
noting the current political season in the @entity7 with an upcoming election in november , @entity2 also said @entity7 support for @entity6 should be a bipartisan issue
he dismissed criticism of his record by @entity120 , saying " it 's not backed up by the facts
" " there should not be a shred of doubt by now , when the chips are down , i have @entity6 's back , " @entity2 said to applause
before @entity2 spoke , @entity120 operative @entity128 said during a panel discussion that no @entity7 president had done more to undermine @entity6 than @entity2
@entity131 , the executive director of the @entity132 , said he doubted @entity2 's speech would satisfy everyone
while some will embrace @entity2 's core message of an ironclad commitment to @entity6 , others will question why @entity2 did n't go further in specifying his intentions regarding @entity3 , @entity131 said
in addition , @entity131 said he expected the @entity120 presidential candidates , when addressing the conference this week , to " mince few words on @entity3 , " something that is easier to do " as they do n't have to directly bear the consequences of their words
" in an unusual move last week , the @entity149 sent out a video aimed at fending off potential @entity120 attacks over @entity2 's @entity6 policies
earlier sunday at the opening of the @entity17 conference , @entity6 president @entity154 accused @entity3 of plotting to control the @entity157 , and warned " it will be stopped
" @entity6 " does not seek " war , @entity154 said , adding : " peace is always our first option
but , if we are forced to fight , trust me , we shall prevail
" speaking just before @entity2 , @entity154 said , " the @entity7 and @entity6 share the same goal : to prevent @entity3 from developing a nuclear weapon
there is no space between us
our message is clear : @entity3 will not develop a nuclear weapon
" " @entity3 is an evil , cruel , morally corrupt regime , " @entity154 said
" it is based on destruction
it is an affront to human dignity
@entity3 is the center , the sponsor , the financier of world terror
@entity3 is a danger to the entire world
it threatens @entity178 as well as @entity179 , @entity180 as well as @entity181
" @entity6 blames @entity3 for recent attacks apparently aimed at @entity6 diplomats in @entity184 and @entity185
" @entity3 's ambition is to control the @entity157 , so it can control a major part of the world 's economy , " @entity154 said
" it must be stopped
and it will be stopped
" @entity2 has argued that a military attack on @entity3 may not be the key to resolving nuclear concerns
" at a time when there is not a lot of sympathy for @entity3 and its only real ally , ( @entity199 ) is on the ropes , do we want a distraction in which suddenly @entity3 can portray itself as a victim ? " @entity2 said last week in an interview with the @entity204
he made the same contention sunday , saying history showed that the only way to truly halt nuclearization is when countries halt their programs themselves
in his speech sunday , @entity154 helped create a welcome reception for @entity2
" i know your commitment to @entity6 is deep and profound , " @entity154 said
" under your leadership , security cooperation between the @entity7 and @entity6 has reached its highest level
ladies and gentlemen , we have a friend in the @entity67
" the remarks may help shore up election - year support for @entity2 among @entity226 voters
in his later remarks , @entity2 praised @entity154 as a leader and a living example of @entity6 's history and values , and announced he would award @entity154 the @entity232 -- @entity7 's highest civilian honor -- at the @entity67 later this year
the audience responded with a long ovation that @entity2 joined from the podium , and @entity66 later said in his statement that he congratulated @entity154 on the @entity232 and called it " a great honor for the @entity6
" while the prime minister is the head of @entity6 's government , @entity154 holds some authority as president including serving as head of state and appointing some senior officials
on the other major issue of @entity7 - @entity6 relations , @entity154 also called the principle of a two - state solution with @entity251 " a paramount @entity6 interest
" he noted that he meets " from time to time " with @entity251 president @entity253 and prime minister @entity254
" they need and they want peace
i believe that peace is possible
they are our partners for peace
" @entity154 also had a message for @entity199 facing a violent crackdown on an uprising against the regime
" @entity157 is undergoing its greatest storm in history , with horrible bloodshed in @entity199 , where a tyrant is killing his people , killing his children , " @entity154 said
" i admire the courage of the @entity199 people
and i wish them peace and freedom from the depths of all of our hearts
in spite of the storm , we have to reach out to the young generation in the @entity284 world , to those who strive for freedom , democracy and peace
" @entity1 's @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .
