scientists are inviting you to take part in " waking up " a comet - chasing probe that has been in hibernation in space for nearly three years
the spacecraft is due to reactivate itself from an internal alarm clock on monday but to celebrate the event the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) is asking people to film themselves shouting " @entity13 , @entity14 ! " and then share their video clips on a dedicated @entity17 page
visitors to the page can vote for their favorites and the top 10 will be transmitted towards @entity14 and out into the universe beyond
behind the fun lies a ground - breaking mission , which , if successful , will notch up a series of notable firsts
@entity14 will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet and to place a lander on the surface as it approaches and then swings around the sun. @entity11 says the mission 's objective is to help understand the origin and evolution of the solar system and investigate the role that comets may have played in seeding @entity39 with water
named after the @entity41 --- a block carved with ancient scripts that led to @entity45 hieroglyphs being deciphered -- the â‚¬ 1 billion ( $ 1.36 billion ) space mission was launched in 2004
since then , @entity11 says it has been around the sun five times as controllers line it up to meet comet @entity50 in august this year
for the last 31 months it has been in hibernation for the coldest part of the journey that took it close to the orbit of @entity56
after mapping the comet 's surface it will release the lander @entity59 in november and monitor changes as it gets closer to the sun. @entity11 project scientist @entity63 said if the project is successful it will advance the knowledge about comets
" it 's the first time we 've made a rendezvous with a comet -- that 's never been done before -- and it 's going to be the first time we 've escorted a comet past its closest approach to the @entity77 , " he told @entity67
" the cherry on the cake is that we also deploy the lander to probe the surface of the comet
" with these firsts it will enable us to make a quantum leap in our understanding of comets -- where they come from , their consistencies
" previous missions have only flown past comets at high speed
@entity14 will get within 5km ( 3.1 miles ) when we deploy the lander and will be in pace with the comet -- we will be really up close and personal with it
" @entity63 explained that the spacecraft was designed to be put in hibernation because even with massive solar panels the size of a basketball court , @entity14 would not have enough power to complete its mission without this energy - saving strategy
the lander is equipped with harpoons to attach itself to the comet , which is about 4km ( 2.5 miles ) long , and then drill about 20cm ( 8 inches ) into the surface to analyze the chemical components
often described as " dirty snowballs , " comets are known to contain a lot of ice but scientists want to learn more about their exact composition
@entity116 , an astronomer and research scientist at the @entity119 's @entity118 , explained that when comets approach the sun , the ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail
the dust produces a separate , curving tail
" astronomers believe comets are made of pristine solar system material before the solar system was formed , " he said
" they are the left over bits that never became a planet
" some think that @entity39 may have received its water from comets , or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life on our planet
" when @entity39 and @entity143 formed it would have been very hot so they would have formed dry , " said @entity116
" and it was certainly very hot when @entity39 was hit by something that made the @entity147
the only things we know that have a large amount of water on them are comets
" he said if @entity14 can establish the composition of this comet then " the question of where life came from might be better answered than before
" @entity14 's target comet @entity50 is known as a short - period comet
it reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the @entity166 's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to @entity39 to be visible until 2061
others only return after thousands of years
recently , comet @entity169 was mostly destroyed in its close encounter with the sun in november last year but it did provide scientists with fresh data in the process
