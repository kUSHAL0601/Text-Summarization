-- @entity1 is immediately limiting carry - on items for flights to the @entity4 in the aftermath of a failed terror attack on a @entity8 flight
" effective immediately , @entity4 - bound passengers are not allowed to bring carry - on bags into the cabin of the aircraft , with some exceptions , " said a statement from @entity10
according to the agency , carry - ons will be limited to medication or medical devices , small purses , cameras , coats , infant - care items , laptop computers , containers carrying life - sustaining or special - needs items , musical instruments , or diplomatic or consular bags
crutches , canes and walkers also are permitted
" these measures are expected to be in place at least for several days , " @entity10 said
@entity1 made the change after a botched terrorism attack on a @entity4 - bound plane
@entity37 , 23 , is charged with attempting to destroy a @entity8 flight from @entity39 , @entity40 , to @entity41 , @entity42 , on christmas day
he attempted to ignite an explosive device sewn into his underwear , authorities say
@entity37 , a @entity46 who had a multiple - entry visa to the @entity4 , had been added to a watch list of 550,000 potential terrorist threats
but " the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no - fly list , " a @entity4 official said
@entity37 first boarded a @entity58 flight from @entity59 , @entity46 , to @entity39
both @entity46 authorities and @entity58 , a @entity8 partner , say he received secondary security screening
but a @entity4 official said friday that @entity37 was not checked for traces of explosives using a more extensive test
the @entity68 had invoked a so - called " one - hour rule " after the thwarted attack , sources told @entity0
the rule prohibited passengers on international @entity4 - bound flights from leaving their seats during the last hour of a flight , the sources said
passengers had to stow pillows and blankets , and maps viewed on in - flight entertainment screens were disabled during the final hour of flight
@entity68 has since modified the rule , giving airlines and crews discretion over implementation , sources said
" when we were landing in the @entity4 we could n't get up or have anything on our laps , " said @entity89 , who traveled from @entity90 with her small child
" it was difficult because right at the end he wanted some milk , and i could n't give it to him
" several international airlines posted advisories on their web sites regarding extra screenings and carry - on bags for international @entity4 - bound flights , saying that the @entity4 government 's revisions have prompted changes for passengers flying to the @entity4
only one carry - on bag is allowed for international @entity4 - bound flights , the advisories said
@entity109 advised passengers to check in early ; @entity111 told passengers to check in normally
passengers traveling across the @entity4 braced for long lines and delays , as well
@entity115 and @entity116 arrived at the airport in @entity41 , @entity42 , three hours ahead of their flight to @entity119 -- far earlier than they 'd usually allow for a domestic flight
in @entity41 , long lines at the ticket counters greeted @entity125 and @entity8 passengers early tuesday , but subsided by around 8 a.m. security lines were long but moved , forcing passengers to wait only about 15 minutes
@entity0 's @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report
