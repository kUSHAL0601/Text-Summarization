-- boxer @entity2 's fans and critics will find out saturday night if he 's still " money " -- his nickname -- and still undefeated , when he takes on @entity7 super-welterweight champion @entity6 in @entity8
the two fighters offer divergent personalities out of the ring , and distinct styles in it
the 31 - year - old @entity6 is more inconspicuous and workmanlike , while the 35 - year - old @entity2 has a more flamboyant , brash reputation and a sizable cohort of celebrity supporters
those wishing him luck on @entity19 shortly before the fight included teen pop star @entity21 , skateboarder and @entity25 personality @entity23 , musician @entity26 , and @entity27 of the @entity29 reality show clan
the breakdown of the purse for the fight demonstrates the fighters ' respective clout : win or lose , @entity2 is set to pocket $ 32 million , while @entity6 would get $ 8 million
while the odds are against him , @entity6 declared before the bout that he had " no doubt " he 'd win
" i 'm ready and prepared for anything he can bring to me , " @entity6 said
physically , @entity2 entered the bout as the taller of the two by an inch , while @entity6 weighed in at 154 pounds , three pounds more than his foe
@entity43 , a boxing analyst and commentator for @entity45 ( which like @entity0 is owned by @entity46 ) said @entity2 has evolved into a " consistent , thudding puncher " who counts on pressuring his opponent
in the other corner , @entity6 is known for being aggressive and a deft puncher , added @entity43
the @entity52 has lost twice in his professional career , most recently against eight - division champion @entity54 -- whom @entity2 has famously challenged verbally , but has never fought
after an accomplished amateur career that includes several @entity57 titles , @entity2 burst on the pro scene in 1996 and has n't lost since
the @entity61 native 's athletic success speaks for itself , having won seven different titles in various weight classes in his career
but he 's had his share of trouble outside of the ring
that includes a 90 - day prison sentence tied to his conviction on a domestic violence charge , after police said he 'd punched the mother of his children at his home
@entity2 had been set to go to prison earlier this year , but a @entity78 judge pushed back his reporting date to june because the boxer had already lined up saturday 's fight date .
