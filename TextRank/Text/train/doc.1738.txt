-- though we 're still in the early stages of 2014 , it is already proving one of the most expensive years for the travel industry
according to @entity7 , an enterprise software company that crunches big data for the transport and logistics sectors , january 's bizarre weather patterns have already cost passengers flying into and out of the @entity12 $ 2.5 billion , and airlines between $ 75m and $ 150m because of canceled and delayed flights
" it 's not easy for an airline to recoup losses resulting from an aircraft being delayed or canceled , " says @entity15 , @entity16 's vice president of business development
" the cost of pilots that do n't take off , the crew overtime , reimbursing tickets -- those costs are n't easy to make up
" for passengers , a plane stuck on the tarmac can cost more than aggravation and the price of a ticket
even with a refund , stranded fliers are stuck with the bill for hotel rooms , taxis , rental cars , food and other unanticipated expenses
" on average , a canceled flight takes a passenger an additional 18 hours of travel time to get to their destination , " @entity15 explains
" during that time , they 're going to incur costs they were n't anticipating , costs the airlines do n't have a responsibility to cover , so that passengers are going to be out of pocket
" according to flight - tracking website @entity54 , this has been the worst year on record for cancellations in the @entity12
since december 1 , 2013 , nearly 90,000 flights have been canceled
" domestically , it 's been a terrible year
by the end of january , we 've has as many cancellations as we usually see through mid-april , " says @entity60 , @entity54 's vice president of operations
regional airlines were the most affected by the weather , though none as severely as @entity66 , which saw its revenue for january reduced by $ 45 million
" while we generally have a strong ability to recapture revenue when we cancel flights during weather events by re-accommodating , our re-booking options for our customers during this high - traffic period were very limited , " admits @entity66 spokeswoman @entity68
according to @entity15 , however , the weather in - and - of itself was n't what grounded millions of flyers , but the airline 's capacity to handle them
@entity15 blames two government regulations for the issue , the first issued by the @entity12 @entity84 delaying the amount of time a plane is allowed to stay on the tarmac to three hours ( and imposing $ 27,500 in fines for carriers that do n't comply ) , and the second is a restriction on how long pilots can remain on duty
" those are two artificial policy restraints that airlines are working with operationally , " she says
another issue is airlines stuffing planes to capacity , meaning when there are cancellations or delays , there is less flexibility in booking passengers on an alternative flight
" load factor is the highest it 's been in history
it 's not easy to re-accommodate passengers a couple of days later , " @entity60 notes
given the likelihood that this year 's bizarre weather patterns are possibly a result of climate change , and could become less of an anomaly and more the norm , one wonders how airlines are prepared to adjust in future years
@entity60 recons one bad winter wo n't be enough to spur airlines to action
" no one will look at one winter and decide to spend a lot of money they do n't have , " he says
" but i think if we see a lot of bad winters in a row , airlines will invest in more tools , processes , and procedures to help them recover
