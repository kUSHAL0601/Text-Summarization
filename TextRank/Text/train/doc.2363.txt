thirteen years and more than 2,000 @entity4 casualties after it began , the war in @entity2 will conclude responsibly , president @entity0 said on sunday
in a written statement marking the formal end of @entity4 combat there , @entity0 said the remaining 10,000 or so @entity4 troops in @entity2 would still face danger but that the longest @entity4 war ever was now history
" our personnel will continue to face risks , but this reflects the enduring commitment of the @entity4 to the @entity2 people and to a united , secure and sovereign @entity2 that is never again used as a source of attacks against our nation , " @entity0 said
@entity4 troops went to fight in @entity2 following the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , and the @entity4 spent more than $ 1 trillion dollars there and lost upwards of 2,200 servicemen and women
@entity0 vowed to wind the @entity2 war down when he took office , eventually announcing this year he would reduce the number of troops stationed there to about 10,000 — a massive reduction from the nearly 150,000 who once served
in a ceremony in @entity2 's capital of @entity37 on sunday , the commander of the @entity34 officially marked the end of coalition combat in @entity2 by rolling up the @entity34 flag
the city has suffered an uptick in @entity44 violence as the drawdown date approached , though @entity4 officials maintain the country is far better off now than when the @entity4 began its mission 13 years ago
" our courageous military and diplomatic personnel in @entity2 — along with our @entity52 allies and coalition partners — have helped the @entity2 people reclaim their communities , take the lead for their own security , hold historic elections and complete the first democratic transfer of power in their country 's history , " @entity0 said
the president has spent much of last year marking the withdrawal of combat troops in @entity2 , from his announcement in may that @entity4 combat troops would leave the country by january 2015 , to an appearance at @entity69 earlier this month acknowledging persistent security challenges there
" @entity2 is still a very dangerous place , " @entity0 said at the @entity72 base
" but i want you , and every @entity4 who has served in @entity2 , to be proud of what you 've accomplished there
" @entity78 : 2 @entity4 soldiers , 19 @entity2 killed currently on vacation with his family in @entity82 , the president used a @entity84 address to @entity85 stationed on @entity86 to hail the achievements of the @entity4 military in @entity2 , asserting the @entity4 is safer because of the effort there
@entity2 is " not going to be a source of terrorist attacks again , " he said at the @entity82 in @entity92
other @entity4 officials — including vice president @entity94 and defense secretary @entity95 — have also marked the end of the @entity4 combat mission in @entity2
@entity98 said sunday the work of @entity4 troops has " made our world safer and given @entity2 the opportunity to chart a secure , democratic , and prosperous future
" sen. @entity104 , the @entity106 @entity105 , visited @entity37 on @entity84 to meet with @entity2 's new president .
