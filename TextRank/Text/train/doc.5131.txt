i was diagnosed with diabetes 12 years ago
at the time , i was caring for my mother , who was on dialysis and had had her leg amputated
as a family , we knew very little about diabetes -- only that once you got it , you deteriorated and died
like our father , who suffered a stroke and then died years later of a massive heart attack brought on by complications of diabetes
both my parents , in fact , died from complications of diabetes
they were strong pillars of our family and community , taken way too soon by a disease that is the leading cause of death among @entity23
before seeing the doctor , i had been experiencing extreme thirst , especially at night
the tips of my toes felt like bees lived there and were desperate to burst out of my skin
my vision became blurred after each meal
it was 2 p.m. and i had n't eaten anything when the doctor tested my blood sugar level
it was in the high 200s
normal is between 110 and 125
you have diabetes , ms. @entity40 , the doctor said
he prescribed metformin and directed me to a dietitian
she further reiterated what the doctor had told me : how food was related to high blood glucose levels and how consistently high blood glucose levels will eventually lead to amputations , blindness , kidney failure , stroke and other complications
fit nation : why i gave up soda i followed the dietician 's plan for the next few months
i took up walking and noticed that my vision had become clearer
but it did n't take me long to fall back to my old eating habits
a colleague 's birthday celebration , a brother 's graduation party , a friend 's wedding , a cousin 's funeral -- these were all occasions where food was at the center
and in our culture , you show appreciation and respect for those who prepared the food by eating it
i soon found myself hovering around 400 pounds
after six years of oral medication , i was switched to insulin injections
my blood sugar levels were too high , and i was not managing them well
insulin was scary at first
but then i realized it gave me the freedom to eat all my favorite foods ! i would just inject 100 units , and my blood sugar would be normal in a matter of minutes
soon , i was injecting as much as 300 units of insulin a day
it was at this time that i began experiencing extreme pain in my teeth and gums
one of my front teeth became longer than the rest , and i found that i could n't bite into certain foods , such as apples
this front tooth was eventually pulled
the dentist did n't have to do much ; it pretty much fell out on its own
injecting large amounts of insulin meant i was prone to low blood sugar
i would wake up in a sweat as energy quickly left my body
my 8 - year - old son saved my life continuously during this time ; he knew exactly what to do and how to inject insulin
the fact that my life was being saved by a child shamed me
eighteen months ago , my sister and i moved our family from @entity123 to @entity124
i saw the move as an opportunity for me not only to change my own life but , most important , to give my son his childhood
fit nation : celebrate small victories the first thing we did as a family was to enroll at a recreation center
we were all exercising together
the kids had fun in the pool , and i found myself walking again
i also decided to educate myself about diabetes
i had read about people reversing diabetes by eating a plant - based diet
it was an easy plan to follow because i love fruit and vegetables , and they are in abundance here
yet i found that i could n't chew much without feeling extreme pain
i bought a @entity150 blender and started throwing all my vegetables and fruits into it
by @entity154 , i had dropped 80 pounds
then , three days before @entity154 , my dentist told me that i had advanced periodontal disease and all my teeth had to be removed
not effectively controlling my diabetes had proven too much for my gums
i welcomed anything to remove the pain i was experiencing
i decided to ask my friends to film the surgery
the filmmaker kept asking me , " girl , are you sure about this ? are n't you afraid people are going to talk about you ? " you can watch the film on @entity170
it 's called " @entity172 at the dentist
" since then , my son has n't had to worry about waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. to revive me
in fact , since i began training for the @entity177 three weeks ago , we are all sleeping soundly through the night
with the demands of training , i realize that my body needs more fuel
while i enjoy green smoothies , i also need protein and carbohydrates
our choice of animal protein comes from turkey , salmon , chicken , canned tuna and eggs
i buy whole - grain pasta , quinoa and brown rice
we eat only wheat bread and do not eat white flour or sugar
my boys love saimin , a form of ramen noodles popular on the islands
when i make it now , i add broccoli , peas and green onions and throw out the spice packet , which contains a ton of sodium
they complain and ask , " then what 's the use of eating saimin ? " that 's when i show them my dentures , and there 's sudden silence
i still do n't know all the answers to diabetes and obesity
all i know is that we have to look hard at our reasons for change
i 'll be damned if i lose any other body part to this disease
did i mention that i ran my first mile this morning nonstop ? how the ' @entity226 ' came to be
