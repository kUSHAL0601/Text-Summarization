@entity0 , @entity1 -- it takes a seven - hour drive east from @entity5 to get to the prison camps of @entity0
convicted criminals fear the place
it is grim , decaying and intimidating
@entity10 , a member of the @entity1 punk rock collective @entity12 , was sent to @entity0 last year for her part in a performance of a " punk prayer " critical of @entity16 -- then the prime minister , now the president -- at a @entity20 cathedral
found guilty of hooliganism , @entity10 , 23 , was sentenced to two years in the penal colony
she has less than six months left on her sentence
but on september 23 , she declared the conditions at the prison to be intolerable and began a hunger strike
' slave labor ' in a lengthy letter to the news site @entity30 ( a translated version was published in @entity33 's @entity32 ) , @entity10 described " slave labor " and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties
after several days without water , she became so weak that doctors ordered that she be placed in the penal colony 's medical ward on friday
four days later , she ended the hunger strike , said @entity46 , her husband
but @entity10 will resume her protest if conditions at the prison camp do n't improve , he said
she had started developing complications because of the length of the hunger strike , @entity46 said
prison authorities have denied @entity10 's allegations about the situation at the penal colony , accusing her of lying
a similar experience but @entity57 believes every word because she says she lived through a similar experience
@entity57 was convicted of embezzlement and served three years in a @entity0 prison camp
" it 's like torture , " she said
" the system between the administration and the convicts is not just based on subordination , but humiliation , fear , intimidation and physical force
" @entity57 said she also went on a hunger strike after authorities said she could no longer phone her children
she said the psychological pressure applied to make her quit was harder than the hunger
@entity77 , another convicted member of @entity12 , went on a hunger strike earlier this year , protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp
she drew attention and won concessions
@entity10 is waiting to discover if she has done the same .
