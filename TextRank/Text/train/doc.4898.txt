-- as many as 175 enemy troops killed , 18 wounds from enemy fire , 38 hours of battle , 48 hours evading the @entity6 troops in the bush -- and one tiger
those are the numbers behind sgt. maj. @entity10 , an award he received from president @entity12 in a @entity14 ceremony monday
@entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 , was honored for his actions in @entity20 's @entity19 more than 48 years ago
then a 32 - year - old sergeant first class , @entity15 was among a handful of @entity23 working with troops of the @entity25 at @entity26 when the camp was attacked by a large @entity6 and @entity29 force on march 9 , 1966 , according to an @entity31 report
" @entity15 rushed through intense enemy fire and manned a mortar position defending the camp , " the @entity31 report says
" he continued to mount a defense even while incurring wounds from several direct hits from enemy mortars
upon learning that several soldiers were wounded near the center of camp , he temporarily turned the mortar over to another soldier , ran through exploding mortar rounds and dragged several comrades to safety
as the hostile fire subsided , @entity15 exposed himself to sporadic sniper fire and carried his wounded comrades to a more secure position
" later , under enemy fire , some of it coming from @entity57 allies who had defected to the @entity6 during the battle , @entity15 took wounded troops to an airstrip outside the camp for evacuation and drew enemy fire away from the evacuation aircraft
he went outside the camp again to retrieve supplies from an airdrop that fell into a minefield
and that was just day one
" the bottom line is that it was just not my day to go , " @entity15 said in an @entity31 interview at @entity73 , @entity74 , last week
the fighting , and @entity15 ' heroism , continued in the early morning of march 10 when the @entity6 hit the camp with their main attack , according to the @entity31 report
" within two hours , sergeant @entity15 was the only defender firing a mortar weapon
when all mortar rounds were expended , @entity15 began placing effective rifle fire upon enemy as they infiltrated the camp perimeter and assaulted his position
despite receiving additional wounds from enemy rounds exploding on his position , @entity15 fought off relentless waves of attacking @entity6 soldiers , " the @entity31 report says
after falling back to a smaller bunker in @entity26 , @entity15 killed more enemy troops with small arms fire , destroyed equipment and classified documents to prevent them from getting into @entity6 hands , and led a group of soldiers in digging their way out of the rear of the bunker and escaping the besieged camp
but @entity15 ' ordeal was not over
because he was carrying a wounded comrade , he and his small group could n't get to the evacuation helicopters sent to pick up the battle 's survivors
the band faded into the jungle , avoiding their @entity6 pursuers for 48 hours
and that 's where the tiger comes in
" the @entity6 soldiers had us surrounded on a little hilltop and everything started getting kind of quiet , " @entity15 is quoted as saying in an @entity31 report
" we could look around and all at once , all we could see were eyes going around us
it was a tiger that stalked us that night
we were all bloody and in this jungle , the tiger stalked us and the @entity6 soldiers were more afraid of the tiger than they were of us
so , they backed off some and we were ( able to escape )
" helicopters rescued @entity15 and the rest of his group on march 12
the @entity31 says @entity15 killed 135 to 175 enemy soldiers during the @entity132 battle
he suffered 18 wounds during the 86 - hour ordeal
forty - eight years later , @entity15 does n't cite those numbers but two others
" i 'm just a keeper of the medal for those other 16 ( @entity23 troops ) who were in the battle , especially the five who did n't make it , " he told @entity143
" i can tell you every man who was there and the five who lost their lives
i can tell you how that happened
it diminishes , but it does not go away , " @entity15 said
and he remembers the @entity57 who stuck by his side
" there were about 410 indigenous @entity25 soldiers there with us , and of those , only about 122 survived , and most of those were wounded
it was a horrible , horrible battle
there was valor on all sides , not only from the @entity23 , but from the @entity25 soldiers also , " he 's quoted as saying in an @entity31 report
others to receive honor honored with @entity15 at the @entity14 ceremony was one other soldier , posthumously
spc. @entity172 was awarded the @entity173 for his actions in using his body to shield comrades from a grenade blast near @entity178 , @entity20 , in january 1970
additionally , the @entity14 has announced one more @entity173 recipient : from the @entity185 , 1st lt. @entity181 , who held out against @entity183 troops during @entity184 on july 3 , 1863 , part of the @entity186
@entity181 manned the last serviceable @entity31 artillery battery during the @entity183 assault , which came within 100 yards of his position
he was killed by @entity183 gunfire
" his actions made it possible for the @entity31 to successfully repulse the @entity183 assault , " a @entity14 statement said
a ceremony for the presentation of @entity196 's honor has yet to be announced , the @entity14 said .
