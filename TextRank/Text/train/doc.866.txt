were the missiles that shot down two @entity2 military planes on wednesday fired from the @entity4 side of the border ? that 's a possibility that @entity7 intelligence analysts are investigating , @entity7 officials told @entity10 on wednesday
pro-russian rebels quickly claimed credit for downing the military planes
and @entity2 officials claimed the missiles that hit them might have been fired from inside @entity4
one thing is clear : tensions in volatile eastern @entity2 seem to be ratcheting up , less than a week after a missile brought down @entity19 17 there
some of the 12,000 - 15,000 @entity4 troops near the eastern @entity2 border have broken up into smaller groups and moved within five miles or less of the border , and some are even positioned right at the border , according to two @entity7 officials
the movement gives the @entity4 troops the ability to fire surface - to - air missiles , rockets and artillery from inside @entity4 at @entity2 positions without having to acknowledge their own presence , the @entity7 officials said
at the same time , the @entity4 are continuing to reinforce and ship additional weapons into @entity2 " while the world 's attention is on @entity39 , " one @entity7 official told @entity10
there is also intelligence indicating some rebels have left @entity2 and gone across the border into hiding inside @entity4
but the officials said it 's not known if any of those people were associated with the shoot - down of @entity39
" what we know is that , incredibly , even after the shootdown of the @entity52 flight , @entity4 has persisted in a pattern of destabilization against @entity2
it 's continued to send fighters and heavy weapons , tanks and missile launchers across the @entity2 border , " said @entity55 , the @entity7 ambassador to @entity2
if it 's confirmed that the missiles that brought down the @entity2 military planes came from the @entity4 side of the border , @entity55 told @entity10 , it would be an " outrageous , continued escalation of the crisis by @entity4 even after the @entity71 ( @entity4 - made missile system ) brought down an airplane , leading to the death of nearly 300 innocent people
" in response to reports that @entity4 continues to arm rebels in @entity2 , the @entity75 is now looking at expanding sanctions on @entity80
just last week , president @entity81 announced the @entity7 would impose new sanctions on specific targets in @entity4 's critical energy , banking , and defense industries
but deputy national security adviser @entity87 told reporters gathered at the @entity75 that the @entity7 might go even further
" we 're continuing to develop our own set of options
the fact is that @entity4 continues to arm separatists
and so we think there needs to be continuing ratcheting up , " @entity87 told reporters
@entity95 under pressure it 's unclear whether wednesday 's shootdown was the work of @entity101 rebels inside @entity2 , or @entity4 forces themselves -- and whether @entity4 president @entity95 knew about or approved the operation
for months , @entity95 has accused @entity104 of building its forces in the region to threaten @entity4
" the scale of the training and preparedness is also increasing , " @entity95 said recently
" it is important to prepare our defenses on schedule
" as calls mount from the @entity7 and other @entity116 countries for more stringent sanctions against @entity4 , @entity95 took a more conciliatory tone in his most recent public statement
" there are calls for us to influence the militants , " he said earlier this week
" we will do everything in our power
" @entity126 , a @entity4 expert and @entity10 's former @entity80 bureau chief , said @entity95 is facing enormous pressure both from the international community and domestically
business elites are pushing to avoid more sanctions , and @entity4 nationalists want the country to be tougher on @entity2
" you can almost see it , his balancing , he does this when he talks , " @entity126 said
" he is a judo expert
and he is prepared , he 's ready to parry , thrust and protect @entity4 from what he expects are going to be the threats
" @entity2 : pilots ejected after planes were hit an air defense system shot down the @entity2 jets wednesday after the pilots completed a task in @entity149 , a village in @entity2 's @entity151 region near the border with @entity4 , the @entity2 military 's press office said
the jets ' pilots ejected from the planes after they were hit , the military said
information on their condition was n't immediately available
@entity160 , an aide to rebel leader @entity161 , the prime minister of the self - declared @entity162 , told @entity10 that the two jets had been shot down by rebel fighters using a shoulder - fired missile system
but col. @entity166 , a spokesman for the @entity167 , said preliminary information suggested the missiles might have been launched from inside @entity4
the planes were flying at an altitude of 5,200 meters ( 17,000 feet ) when they were hit , he said
news of the jets ' downing wednesday comes six days after the deadly crash of the civilian passenger plane @entity19 17 in eastern @entity2
@entity2 officials have previously accused @entity101 rebels of shooting down several military aircraft
in the week leading up to the july 17 crash of @entity39 , @entity2 officials said an @entity181 transport plane and a @entity183 fighter jet had been brought down
the @entity2 military said the missile that struck the @entity183 had been fired from @entity4 territory
the latest reported shootdown highlights the ongoing conflict in eastern @entity2 's @entity151 and @entity190 regions between the rebels and @entity2 security forces
a @entity10 team on the ground in @entity151 was turned away by rebel fighters at the entrance to the town of @entity198 , near @entity149
the militants said they had orders not to allow people to travel farther because of fighting
a jet could be heard passing periodically very high overhead , while on the ground , ambulances rushed past , as did a convoy of rebel fighters in civilian vans and cars
claim and counterclaim the first caskets carrying remains of the crash victims arrived in the @entity214 on wednesday , where they were met by family members , @entity214 king @entity218 and @entity219 and other dignitaries
about two - thirds of the 298 victims were @entity214
as the solemn tribute continued , accusations did not stop
meanwhile , the finger - pointing continues over who was responsible for bringing down @entity227 , a @entity228 777
@entity7 officials say @entity101 rebels were responsible for shooting down that plane , but they say they now believe it 's likely the rebels did n't know it was a commercial airliner , @entity7 intelligence officials said tuesday
however , @entity236 , @entity2 's director of informational security , told @entity10 's @entity237 that the person who shot down the flight was " absolutely " a @entity4
" a @entity4 - trained , well - equipped , well - educated officer ... pushed that button deliberately , " he said
@entity80 has denied claims that it pulled the trigger
and @entity245 lt. gen. @entity244 suggested a @entity2 jet fighter may have shot the plane down
@entity2 's government rejects that claim .
