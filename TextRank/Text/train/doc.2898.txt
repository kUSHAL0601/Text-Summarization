a @entity1 judge on tuesday set bail for @entity3 at $ 9,000 and ordered a number of conditions for his freedom -- including that he not possess weapons -- while he awaits trial on charges he pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend
he was released from the @entity12 on tuesday afternoon
he did n't speak with the media
it was unclear where he was headed
@entity3 was arrested monday at his girlfriend 's @entity17 home , four months after he was acquitted of murdering teenager @entity19
earlier , @entity3 said little as a judge , during @entity3 's first appearance tuesday afternoon in @entity23 court , said he found probable cause for @entity3 's arrest on a felony charge of aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief
@entity3 's arraignment has been scheduled for january 7
a prosecutor revealed a new allegation against @entity3 while trying to argue for a higher bail -- that @entity3 tried to choke his girlfriend a week and a half before monday 's alleged shotgun incident , and that @entity3 had talked about suicide
assistant state attorney @entity38 argued for $ 50,000 bail , saying that new information should heighten concern for the accuser 's safety , though the alleged incident had n't been reported to police
the new allegation is not reflected in the preliminary charges
but judge @entity48 cited the choking accusation when he put the bail at $ 9,000 , saying it prompted him to set it higher than the $ 4,900 requested by the defense
@entity55 and @entity56 , the public defenders representing @entity3 , told reporters afterward that they had n't known of the choking allegation previously
" that was news to us , " @entity55 said
" ... that was not contained in the arrest report , and that 's the first we 've heard about it
" @entity48 put conditions on @entity3 's bail : that he can not go to two @entity1 addresses ; he can not have contact with the accuser , @entity70 ; he can not possess weapons ; he must wear a monitoring device ; and he can not travel outside @entity1
the judge initially said @entity3 could return to one of the banned addresses with law enforcement to retrieve his belongings , but later -- at @entity38 's urging -- revsersed that allowance , saying a third party could get the belongings instead
@entity56 told reporters he was confident @entity3 would be acquitted
" he 's maintained his innocence , i 'll tell you that , " @entity55 said @entity56 was asked about @entity70 's alleged claims that @entity3 talked about suicide
" he 's back in jail
obviously that causes a certain amount of anxiety and stress on somebody
i would not characterize him as what the state attorney has said , meaning he 's suicidal and volatile
we did not get that impression from him , " @entity56 said
@entity3 's public defenders said tuesday they were appointed to the case because @entity3 said he could n't afford an attorney
he is unemployed , according to a police report , and has about $ 150 to his name with debts of $ 2.5 million , according to his request for a public defender
@entity106 told @entity110 's " @entity109 " that he paid the bond for his friend
@entity3 claims dispute arose over alleged pregnancy @entity3 was arrested monday afternoon at @entity70 's @entity17 home after she called 911 , said @entity114 , chief deputy with the @entity115
@entity3 told police the argument erupted after he tried to leave because @entity70 was pregnant and wanted to raise their child by herself , though police say @entity70 disputed the account
" she told me it was better if we co-parented and she raised the child on her own , " @entity3 said to a 911 dispatcher in a separate call
" i said , ' are you sure this is what you want to do ? ' she said , ' yes
' " @entity3 continued , " as soon as i started packing up my stuff to leave , she just completely changed
" asked to elaborate , @entity3 said he wanted to leave amicably , but @entity70 " just started smashing stuff , taking stuff that belonged to me and throwing it outside , throwing it out of her room , throwing it all over the place
" i guess she thought i was going to argue with her , but she 's pregnant
i 'm not going to put her through that type of stress
" in a question - and - answer session after monday 's news conference , @entity114 told reporters , " at this time , the victim has disclosed to us that she is not pregnant
" differing 911 calls according to a police report about the incident , @entity70 said that after an argument , @entity3 broke a table with a shotgun and then pointed it at her " for a minute
" @entity70 called 911 at 12:30 p.m. et , @entity114 said
on a 911 call recording released by police , a woman can be heard telling authorities : " he 's inside my house breaking all my ( things ) because i asked him to leave
" the woman then says to someone at the house , " i 'm doing this again ? you just broke my glass table
you just broke my sunglasses and you put your gun in my freaking face and told me to get the ( expletive ) out
" a man is heard telling her to calm down , but then she tells the dispatcher that the man just pushed her out of the house and locked the door
in his 911 call , @entity3 says that his girlfriend was , " for lack of a better term , going crazy on me " and throwing his things out
he says the woman is outside with police
asked why he is calling , @entity3 says , " i just want everyone to know the truth
" he says he never pulled a firearm and that it is in a bag , locked
he says she was the one who broke the table
when deputies arrived at the house , @entity70 gave them a key
when they pushed open the door -- which was blocked by several small pieces of furniture -- they found @entity3 , who was sitting and unarmed , @entity114 said
he was passive and cooperative , @entity114 said
the sheriff 's office was seeking a search warrant to look for two guns deputies believed were inside the home , he said
according to the police report , @entity3 had locked up the guns before police arrived
@entity3 's wife has doubts about his innocence @entity70 ' in a safe place , ' mother says @entity70 's mother , @entity208 , said on monday , " my daughter is doing good , and she 's in a safe place

@entity3 's estranged wife , @entity213 , filed for divorce on september 5 and the papers were served monday night while he was in jail
@entity213 's attorney , @entity217 , said it was the first opportunity to give him the documents
days after the filing , @entity213 called 911 and alleged that her husband had threatened her -- one of several brushes that @entity3 has had with law enforcement since he was acquitted in july of murder and manslaughter in the 2012 shooting death of teenager @entity19
recent contact with authorities police detained @entity3 on september 9 after his estranged wife told a 911 dispatcher that he had threatened her and her father at her father 's house in @entity235 , @entity1
but earlier this month , @entity235 police said no charges would be filed , saying there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the case
in late september , @entity213 told @entity242 's @entity241 on the " today " show that she had doubts about her husband 's innocence in the @entity19 case
@entity3 also has been stopped for speeding twice since his july acquittal
he was pulled over the first time in @entity249 , @entity250 , in july and told the police officer he had a concealed weapon permit and a gun in his glove compartment
the officer wrote on his incident report that he gave @entity3 a verbal warning

he was not carrying a weapon at the time
