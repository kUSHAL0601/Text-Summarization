-- it 's been a while since we 've heard anything concrete on @entity6 's rumored " @entity7 " device , but @entity8 now reports that @entity6 has filed on june 3 to trademark that name in @entity11
this does n't necessarily mean anything -- companies file for protective trademarks all the time -- but it 's one more indication that @entity6 is dabbling in wearable computing
@entity7 rumors have been flying for most of the year , but we still do n't have a clear idea of what the gadget might look like ( or what it would do ) if it ever comes to market
one report said that the watch would run a version of @entity27 but suggested that battery life issues could be holding it back
the watch might also include a pedometer and other sensors to help it compete with fitness gadgets like @entity35 's @entity34 and the @entity36
@entity6 ceo @entity37 has previously said that " amazing new hardware " would be coming out this fall and throughout 2014 , but whether he meant new product categories like an @entity7 or simply refreshes of @entity6 's existing products ( like the new @entity40 ) is anyone 's guess
either way , there 's no need to worry if the @entity7 does n't pan out -- you can always rely on the @entity49 watch or the rumored devices from @entity51 , @entity52 , or @entity53 to cover your unsightly naked wrists
