pope @entity0 wants to bring hope to @entity2 and other ethnic and religious groups suffering " brutal persecution " in @entity5 and @entity6
the @entity0 used his @entity8 blessing , " @entity9 , " to draw attention to displaced children and adults in the @entity13 " who for too long now have suffered the effects of ongoing conflict , " he said , in a reference to the @entity6 civil war and increased instability in @entity5 with the rise of @entity21
the pontiff appealed for compassion for refugees " so that all who now are suffering may receive the necessary humanitarian help to overcome the rigors of winter
" tens of thousands gathered thursday in @entity30 in @entity31 to hear the pontiff 's blessing , which is customarily global in nature
" @entity9 " is @entity35 , meaning " to the city ( @entity37 ) and to the world
" the message comes a day after @entity0 delivered his second @entity40 as @entity0
the @entity0 has used his influence as the spiritual leader of all @entity43 around the world to affect political outcomes this year
he played a key role in a historic breakthrough in @entity50 - @entity49 relations this month and urged religious tolerance during a visit to @entity53 in november
his blessing thursday included hope for peaceful resolutions of other conflicts around the world
he prayed for reconciliation in @entity60 and for peace in @entity62 , where @entity64 militants are killing and kidnapping people in the northern part of the @entity68 country
" may @entity69 give peace to @entity62 , where more blood is being shed and too many people are unjustly deprived of their possessions , held as hostages or killed , " he said
he also noted other @entity68 countries dealing with a rise in @entity64 militant attacks and those fighting the @entity79 crisis
" truly there are so many tears this @entity8 , " he said
making a special appeal on behalf of youth , he said , " may @entity69 save the vast numbers of children who are victims of violence , made objects of trade and trafficking , or forced to become soldiers
" the @entity0 also addressed last week 's school massacre in @entity92 in which @entity94 militants gunned down students
" may the power of @entity69 , which brings freedom and service , be felt in so many hearts afflicted by war , persecution and slavery , " he said
@entity0 called on @entity2 to embrace their faith and reject selfishness
" may this divine power , by its meekness , take away the hardness of heart of so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference
