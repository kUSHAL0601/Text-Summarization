-- the commander of @entity4 's rebel army was killed in @entity5 along with two senior officers on thursday , rebel leaders announced just hours after claiming big successes on the battlefield
the death of gen. @entity10 came after the rebels ' @entity11 sought @entity10 for questioning about military matters and alleged ongoing ties to @entity4 leader @entity15 , according to what @entity10 ' supporters told journalist @entity18 of the @entity19
supporters also shot at a @entity5 hotel and smashed its windows
journalists had been gathered at the hotel for a press conference held by the rebel 's civilian leader who announced @entity10 was summoned back to @entity5 and was killed along with his two aides under unclear circumstances , @entity18 told @entity0
@entity0 's @entity31 analyzes the situation in @entity4 @entity18 described the events surrounding @entity10 ' death as " extremely murky , " but he said the rebel army appeared to be on the brink of a rift
@entity10 had served as interior minister in @entity15 's government until february , when he defected to the @entity5 - based rebel movement
he was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the rebels ' @entity11 said in a statement aired on their television network late thursday
no further details were immediately released
@entity10 , a onetime general in @entity15 's army , told @entity0 in february that he switched sides after @entity15 told him he planned to have @entity5 bombed -- a move @entity10 said would have killed thousands
rebel forces have been battling to oust @entity15 since then , aided by a @entity53 bombing campaign that has targeted government troops under a @entity56 mandate to protect civilians
more explosions rocked @entity59 shortly before midnight thursday ( 5 p.m. et ) , indicating fresh airstrikes were under way in the @entity4 capital
earlier thursday , the rebels said their forces had captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the @entity69 mountain range , which borders @entity70
hundreds of rebels moved from their mountain positions at dawn
with heavier weapons leading the way with lighter armed fighters following , they initially encountered fierce resistance from @entity15 's loyalists
col. @entity80 , spokesman for the @entity81 for the western mountain region , said several major battles had taken place before the towns were secured
he named the captured towns as @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , and the surrounded town as @entity93
@entity80 said rebels were now negotiating with @entity15 troops inside @entity93
he said four rebels had been killed in the fighting and at least 20 were wounded , while 20 @entity15 fighters had been captured
the claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by @entity15 forces
@entity80 said that on the eastern side of the mountains , @entity15 forces had been shelling rebel - held positions near @entity109 and also near @entity110
rebel fighters last month suffered heavy casualties in a failed attempt to wrest control of @entity115 from forces loyal to @entity15
last week , rebel fighters manning hilltops in the western mountains overlooking @entity91 told @entity0 that they had been watching the government forces reinforcing their weapon stocks with heavy military machinery and rocket launchers
the @entity124 on wednesday recognized the @entity5 - based rebels as @entity4 's legitimate government , and the @entity127 recently recognized the council as the country 's " legitimate governing authority
" @entity124 foreign secretary @entity131 on wednesday reiterated his stance that @entity15 could remain in @entity4 if he leaves power , but added that the best thing would be for him to face justice at the @entity136 , which is seeking his arrest
@entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .
