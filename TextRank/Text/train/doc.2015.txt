-- a flu shot can do more than just fight against influenza , a new study suggests
it may also fight against heart attacks
adults who take the flu vaccine may be less likely to get their first heart attack the next year , researchers say
the study , published monday in the @entity12 , was conducted to add to other studies that suggested that there is a link between respiratory infections and heart attacks
" by the nature of the study , it does not prove cause and effect
so it does not prove that the flu vaccine prevents heart attacks
but it does show that the flu vaccine is associated with the reduction , " said @entity25 , one of the authors of the study and a professor at the @entity29 in @entity30
@entity35 researchers , who conducted the study , compared the medical records of a little more than 16,000 first - time heart attack victims age 40 and older with the records of nearly 62,700 people who had not had heart attacks
after factoring other major risks for heart attacks , such as smoking and family history of heart ailments , the research found that the flu shot was associated to a 19 percent reduction in the rate of first heart attack , the study found
and the benefit was even more for those that received flu shots earlier in the flu season
those who got the shots early had a 21 percent reduction in the rate of heart attacks in the next year , the study found .
