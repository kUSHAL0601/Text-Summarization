@entity2 boston marathon bombing suspect @entity0 told a judge thursday he was satisfied with his defense lawyers at what is expected to be the final public hearing before his death penalty trial begins on january 5
wearing gray slacks a white button - down shirt under a black sweater , @entity0 said , " yes , sir , " to a series of questions from the judge , including whether he was pleased with his defense and had been kept informed about his case
it was the first time @entity0 -- suspected with his older brother @entity19 of planting two bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the @entity1 finish line in april 2013 -- appeared in a @entity2 federal court since he pleaded not guilty last year
one of the more colorful developments happened as the 25 - minute hearing ended
@entity27 -- mother - in - law of @entity28 , a @entity29 associate whom an @entity31 agent shot and killed in @entity32 last year during what authorities say was a separate murder investigation -- was in attendance and shouted in support of @entity0 as he was led away in handcuffs
" i said in court , ' @entity0 , you have a lot of supporters
... we know you 're innocent , ' " @entity27 told reporters afterward
@entity28 , like the @entity0 family , was from @entity46 -- though the @entity0 brothers were born in @entity48
also at thursday 's hearing , a potential defense expert witness who has been interviewing @entity0 's relatives was a center of contention between the prosecution and the defense
the prosecution says it does n't want the witness to offer an opinion on whether @entity0 was under his older brother 's control
@entity0 was 19 at the time of the bombings ; @entity19 , who was killed in a police encounter days after the incident , was 26
the defense , in a status hearing in april , called the @entity0 family dynamic key to their case
the judge did not immediately rule on the witness
possibly another trial delay ? @entity0 attorney @entity72 said his team could file yet another motion to have the trial delayed
in september , defense attorneys succeeded in moving the trial from november 3 to january 5
but they wanted it delayed much longer -- until september 1 , 2015 -- citing a large volume of information in the case
but unless @entity72 files another motion and a judge grants it , @entity0 is set to stand trial in less than three weeks
authorities say @entity0 and his older brother planted two pressure - cooker explosives , hidden in backpacks , near the finish line of the @entity1 on april 15 , 2013
as spectators watched runners finish the race in the afternoon , the bombs exploded 12 seconds apart , killing 8 - year - old @entity94 , 29 - year - old @entity95 and @entity96 , a @entity97 graduate student from @entity98 , and injuring more than 260 others
timeline : the bombing , manhunt and investigation three days later , after the @entity31 released surveillance photos of the suspects , the @entity105 shot and killed @entity109 police officer @entity108 , authorities say
early the next day , authorities say , the brothers hijacked a car in @entity113 , and then threw explosives out the car windows and exchanged gunfire with police who pursued them
@entity29 died of wounds he suffered in the encounter , but @entity0 got away , leading to a massive manhunt
he was found that night in a motorboat dry - docked in the backyard of a @entity127 , @entity126 , home , covered in blood from bullet wounds sustained in that morning 's shootout
@entity0 faces more than 30 federal charges , including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death
federal prosecutors announced earlier this year that they will seek the death penalty against him , arguing he acted in " an especially heinous , cruel and depraved manner " and lacks remorse
prosecutors have said they expect to call between 80 and 100 witnesses in a three - to four - month trial
from fears to cheers : the final hours that paralyzed @entity2 in september , a federal judge denied @entity0 's bid to move his upcoming trial out of @entity126
his lawyers had argued that pretrial publicity and public sentiment jeopardized his opportunity for a fair trial
@entity154 district judge @entity153 rejected the argument that 12 impartial jurors could n't be found in the area , saying @entity126 ' eastern federal district had about 5 million people
as for @entity28 , authorities said an @entity31 agent fatally shot the 27 - year - old at his @entity32 apartment in may 2013
this happened as @entity31 agents and @entity126 state troopers questioned him about a 2011 @entity2 - area triple murder that they thought could have been tied to @entity168 and @entity29
a report by @entity32 's 9th circuit state attorney , @entity170 , concluded this year that @entity28 's killing was justified -- a finding that concurred with a reviews by the @entity31 and the @entity32 state attorney for @entity176 and @entity177 counties
the report cites @entity31 documents that said @entity179 was writing a confession to the triple murder when when he attacked , flipping the table he was writing on and striking an @entity31 agent in the head
@entity179 ran to the kitchen and was heard frantically grabbing items before reappearing in the doorway wielding a long metal handle of a mop or broom
the report said @entity168 took an attack stance with the pole and lunged violently at the agent , who shot him , with fatal wounds to his head and his heart , according to the documents
@entity28 's family has disputed that he posed any threat to the law enforcement officers and agents in his apartment
@entity154 law enforcement officials said @entity168 made statements implicating himself and @entity29 in the 2011 killings
@entity2 bombing suspect 's friend convicted @entity3 's @entity208 and @entity209 reported from @entity2 ; @entity3 's @entity210 reported and wrote in @entity211
@entity3 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .
