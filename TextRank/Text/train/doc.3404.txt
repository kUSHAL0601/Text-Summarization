there 's only one way to start an interview with @entity4
why , i ask him , should i believe a word he says ? " i like that question , " says the pre-eminent @entity10 conceptual artist , when we meet in the caf√© at @entity14 's @entity13
" i believe that doubting is the first step to rational knowledge
not doubting implies submission , which is dangerous
" if truth be told , there are more reasons to doubt @entity4 than anyone else
after all , this is the man who has pranked , dodged and bamboozled his way to the top of the art world
fake files in 1987 , in an exhibition called @entity33 , he pretended that he had stumbled across the hidden archives of a @entity36 zoologist called dr @entity37 , which contained samples of animals previously unknown to science
ten years later , he convinced the world that a @entity44 cosmonaut had been lost in space in 1967 , and the disappearance covered up
the hoax fooled @entity10 tv , which reported it as fact before realizing that the cosmonaut 's name , @entity51 , was a @entity44 translation of the artist 's own name
and at the age of 59 , the diminutive , bearded @entity4 has lost none of his enthusiasm for " playing with conceptions of authority "
last month he pretended to " curate " an exhibition in @entity64 called the @entity65 , which mixed genuine photographs from the @entity67 and @entity68 with his own pastiche , passing it all off as a single archive
from now to november , the @entity13 -- that bastion of empiricism -- is hosting a major retrospective exhibition of @entity4 's work , entitled @entity76
it starts with taxidermy , including a squirrel with a snake 's tail and a winged goat ; moves on to photographs of " constellations " that are actually specks of dust on a car windscreen ; and ends with pictures of the artist himself performing " miracles " , such as levitation , in the garb of a @entity90 monk
the exhibition is visually arresting , subversively humorous , and infernally clever
it is also deeply unsettling
so what is it about @entity4 that makes him so intent on fooling the world ? explosive moment " when i was 13 , i was experimenting in chemistry and i blew up my hand , " he says , sipping espresso
" i was interested in testing things , and was building rockets with gunpowder
it was wonderful , very effective
but one sunday my parents were away traveling , and i was alone with my cousin
" and i blew up my hand
" psychologically , this was very strong
it changed my whole life
i started hiding my hand so people did n't see my problem , which produced very complex human relationships
life became about multiple truths
" because of his damaged hand , he continues , he was excluded from military service , giving him " time to play with photography "
as he could n't handle the camera quickly , photojournalism was out
so he became a " meditative photographic artist "
he shows me the stump of his left index finger
he has told other journalists that he lost his finger while building a " homemade bomb "
is he taking me for a ride -- or them ? ( or has this interview made me paranoid ? ) " well , you could consider it a bomb , " he says
i used to make explosive artifacts and throw them out of the window
i also did underwater explosives with sodium
i made miniature submarines and ships , and blew them up with mines
" the world of @entity4 is strange indeed
propaganda machine bombs and rockets aside , it was the political climate in which he came of age that informed @entity4 's career
prior to 1975 , @entity155 ruled @entity10 as a dictatorship
the climate of repression and the ubiquity of propaganda in @entity4 's childhood led him to a preoccupation with challenging authority in all its forms
" @entity155 is no longer the enemy , but to me he was just one particular historical manifestation of authoritarianism , " he says
" i struggle against every type of authority , in religion , science , politics , and art. i do n't believe in hierarchies
" does that make him a @entity173 ? " i am a bizarre combination of socialism with anarchy thrown in , " he says
" but i 'm also a pragmatist
i recognize that a representative democracy is necessary
but it has risks , and we must keep paying attention to the system
that 's why i call myself an anarchist
i 'm trying to fix the problems of authoritarianism that might occur in a representative democracy
" an irreverent eye he illustrates this by citing photography
documentary photojournalism , he says , is valuable as an " eye in the distance " , showing people things to which they otherwise would never be exposed
his role is that of the " oculist " , ensuring that the eye remains accurate by questioning the veracity of what it shows us
religion is a favorite target
although he was brought up a @entity209 , as a teenager he experimented with @entity210 and other alternative religions , before becoming a committed agnostic
" the reason i often joke about religious belief is that it brings us to dogma , and to me dogma is stupidity , " he says
" i do n't agree with faith
i think we should keep a questioning mind
" so what next for @entity225 ? " i have lots of ideas and not enough time , " he says
" people often get angry with me , and accuse me of being a liar
i just create ambiguities and encourage people to question things
" he sighs , and drains his coffee
" my mother is always warning me that one day i will finish in jail
but i have more trust in humanity than that
" @entity4 : stranger than @entity238 is showing at the @entity13 , @entity14 , from 23 july -- 9 november 2014 touch it , you know you want to
