@entity0 , @entity1 -- authorities in @entity1 's @entity5 province denied entry monday to two cruise liners that were seeking to dock in the southern port of @entity9 , in incidents linked to the political dispute over the @entity12
the government was applying a provincial law barring ships traveling under @entity17 colony flags from docking at the port , said the state - run @entity20 news agency
both ships were registered in @entity23 , a @entity17 territory
one of the ships -- the @entity25 -- departed @entity26 , @entity27 , on february 18 on a 14 - night @entity29 cruise
" because the ship had previously called at @entity36 , it was denied entry to @entity9 , " said @entity30 , a spokeswoman for @entity31 she was referring to the port city in the @entity12 , which are referred to in @entity1 as @entity12
" we are extremely disappointed about this alteration of the cruise itinerary , and are refunding the cost of shore excursions purchased by our passengers , " she said in an e-mail
the ship is continuing to its next scheduled port of call , @entity48 , @entity49
the 289 - meter ( nearly 950 - foot ) luxury liner , which has a capacity of 2,600 passengers , had docked in @entity9 several times in recent years , she said
the @entity56 cruise liner @entity54 , which is on a @entity29 tour from @entity59 , @entity60 , with an almost entirely @entity17 contingent of passengers , got a similar reception on monday
the ship " was this morning refused permission for its scheduled docking in the @entity1 port of @entity9 by the local mayor on the grounds that it had visited the @entity12 two days before , " said @entity2 contributor @entity64 , who was aboard the @entity66 as a lecturer
both @entity56 and @entity75 are @entity31 cruise brands
the law cited was passed last august and refers to ships that carry out " work related to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources , or to military vessels , within the ambit of the basin of the @entity12 on the @entity1 continental platform , " @entity20 reported
the head of the province 's port authority , @entity88 , said that the decision to turn away the ships was made following " express instructions " from gov. @entity94 , the news agency said
ship authorities were informed of the decision monday morning as they sailed through the @entity97 in front of the @entity49 city of @entity100
last month , the @entity25 was denied entry into the @entity102 when 74 passengers and crew out of a total of 3,652 had gotten sick after the liner stopped in @entity9
the @entity12 ' authorities cited the illnesses as the reason for the denial
the president of the tourism board of @entity113 , @entity114 , said monday 's incident " had nothing to do with the @entity12 subject , " according to @entity20
" it 's necessary to treat the question with much care , " he said
" we all defend @entity12 , but the tourist ships have nothing to do with the request for sovereignty , " he told @entity121 of @entity9
in 1982 , after @entity1 invaded the islands , it fought -- and lost -- a two - month undeclared war with @entity130
still , @entity1 continues to press its claim to the islands , which are home to more than 3,000 people , most of them of @entity17 descent
in @entity0 , a group of intellectuals expressed unhappiness with the way the @entity1 government is handling the matter of the sovereignty of the @entity12
" the policy that the government is carrying out , in reality , is distancing us from the @entity12 instead of getting us nearer , " said @entity144 , a journalist who has proposed greater cultural integration with the islands ' inhabitants
" return to before 1982
in @entity1 , it is very odd the way one thinks about @entity12 , because the public thinks of it as if no one lived there
it is like a thing of magical thought ; that one day we take it and it will be ours
and that is not real
" @entity161 , a philosopher , said the incident has nothing to do with sweeping away the @entity17 culture that is pervasive in the @entity12
" they have the right to determine what they want to be
it 's not for us to impose a culture they do n't want
" @entity144 said that @entity1 was being inconsistent
the country contains " a mountain of @entity60 businesses " that are exploiting the country 's natural resources
" and they are sending money out of the country
in that sense , the government is speaking out both sides of its mouth
on one hand it is attacking @entity60 through the @entity12 and on the other it is favoring some businesses to exploit minerals
it 's a policy that is half schizophrenic
" @entity2 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .
