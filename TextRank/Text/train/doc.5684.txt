@entity3 authorities responded late thursday to a ship without any crew that was carrying 450 migrants , that country 's coast guard said
it 's the second time this week @entity3 's coast guard has rescued such a vessel
" because of the difficult weather conditions , the ship can only be reached by air
from what we know , the ship , which flies the flag of @entity15 , would have hundreds of migrants on board , " the @entity3 air force said in a statement
it said the cargo ship @entity21 was in at a standstill because of a blackout
the migrants launched an @entity25 , said @entity26 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 coast guard
women and children are thought to be on the ship
by early friday morning , the vessel remained at a standstill 58 miles ( 93 kilometers ) off the coast of the city of @entity35 in the @entity36 , the coast guard said , where rescuers were trying to restart the boat 's engines
on wednesday , a freighter carrying 768 people , most believed to be migrants from war - torn @entity44 , docked safely in the southern port of @entity47 after the coast guard seized control
the @entity3 coast guard told @entity50 a " real disaster " was avoided when authorities boarded the @entity52 after the crew apparently jumped ship
@entity3 coast guard commander @entity56 said the vessel was cruising on autopilot toward the rocky @entity3 coast at 6 nautical miles per hour
the course of the vessel was reversed to avoid a collision with the rocks
the coast guard said a collision would not only have led to the deaths of passengers but would also have created an environmental disaster .
