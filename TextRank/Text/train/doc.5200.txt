in this brave , forever - new world of social media , the minutiae of daily life can be documented for public consumption with the tap of a finger
for many , that includes pictures of what they 're consuming on a daily basis , from their morning latte to their evening glass of wine and every @entity16 in between
immortalizing food imagery is certainly not a new phenomenon , though the mediums in which to do so have come a long way from canvases to smartphones
during the @entity25 era , food often appeared in popular works of art by way of still - life paintings , and painter @entity30 is often heralded for elevating the seemingly simplistic genre with dramatic lighting , angles and imperfections
photographer @entity35 was inspired by the " eroticism , presentation and charisma " of these paintings by @entity30 and artists like @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , so she decided to approach a distinctly modern phenomenon -- fast food -- in the @entity25 - era style
" fast food is created to attract , but everybody knows the food they order will -- in the end -- never look like the food in the advertisement 's photo , " @entity35 said
in her series " @entity54 , " she theatrically lights meals of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and donuts , while models pose with hot dogs , marshmallows , ice cream and pizza
@entity35 sees fast food as a symbol of class divide , much like @entity30 unconventionally relied on lower classes of @entity70 people , laborers and even prostitutes to pose for many of his works
social media follow @ @entity76 on @entity77 to join the conversation about photography
" to eat healthy is expensive , " @entity35 said
" however , one can buy large amounts of food at a fast - food restaurant for a comparatively low price
" @entity35 said she was inspired by @entity85 's atypical models and asked her " punk and hippie " friends with visible tattoos and piercings to take part
" it underlines the concept that they are ' children of the modern age , ' having been brought up in the changing @entity97 , often defined by the culture of fast food , " @entity35 said
and in an interesting twist of fate , @entity35 said , most of her subjects avoid the exact type of food they were photographed with
" to them , the food becomes a non-edible object and loses its value as being considered food , " she said
@entity35 is a photographer who also works under the pseudonym @entity108
you can follow her on @entity110 or @entity111 .
