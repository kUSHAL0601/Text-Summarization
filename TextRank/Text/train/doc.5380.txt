@entity0 can focus on his driving and putting after settling a protracted legal dispute with his former management company
the @entity6 avoided a potentially long and drawn out court case in @entity8 , @entity9 , after attempting to sue @entity10 , who in turn were counter-suing the golfer by claiming the @entity14 owed them millions of dollars in commission on contracts up to 2017
@entity0 had labeled the contract he had signed with @entity10 as " unconscionable
" " the legal dispute between @entity0 and @entity10 has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties who wish each other well for the future , " said a joint statement from @entity0 and @entity10
" the parties will be making no further comment , " added the statement
@entity0 reportedly paid $ 22.8m million plus costs to settle the case
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity31 show month , @entity0 insisted the case had been about taking " control of things myself
" he added : " if there 's one good thing that 's came out of all of this , it 's being able to set up my own management team and my own management company
" that 's been huge
even after all of this , having a great team around me and a great team in place , that 's all been worth it
" the period under dispute coincided with @entity0 's sponsorship deal with @entity51 , which was reported be worth around $ 100m
@entity0 , who won the @entity52 last weekend , was not in court when the settlement was announced , though he did make a brief appearance on tuesday
the 25 - year - old had claimed that the fees charged by @entity10 were excessive , while simultaneously being accused of breaching his contract and owing outstanding fees
@entity0 terminated his contract with @entity10 in 2013 to set up his own company .
