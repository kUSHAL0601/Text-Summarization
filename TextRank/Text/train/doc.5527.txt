@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 leader @entity3 is poised to become the next prime minister of economically embattled @entity1 , with his ascension assured after the ruling @entity8 's candidate conceded sunday 's national election
@entity10 made the concession before a somber audience of @entity8 supporters -- a stark contrast to the raucous , celebratory crowd gathered outside the @entity4 headquarters in @entity0
less than 30 minutes later , @entity3 offered " a message of confidence " and vowing to push for " solidarity " in the wake of sunday 's vote
he did so in a televised speech inside a quiet room before coming out minutes later to address the boisterous crowd
" the @entity1 people have expressed themselves , they 've done so clearly , " he said in the first address
" and we 'll now embrace this change
" as detailed on the @entity31 website , with 100 % of the votes counted , the @entity4 had over 10.8 million votes ( 44.6 % of the total votes ) and captured 186 seats in parliament
that compares with just under 7 million votes for the @entity8 , giving it an advantage in 110 legislative contests
a party had to win 175 seats in order to win an outright majority in the 350 - seat chamber
the majority result , thus , paves the way for @entity3 's unfettered ascension to prime minister , giving him a free hand to set policy without having to first make deals with other parties
the outcome makes @entity1 the latest country to lose a government amid the @entity59 - wide money crisis
earlier this month , the leaders of @entity61 and @entity62 resigned over their own countries ' debt woes
in the closing days of the campaign , the 56 - year - old @entity3 had spoken repeatedly about the nation 's deep economic crisis , such as the sobering 21.5 % unemployment rate overall -- including a 45 % rate of unemployment for young people
nearly 5 million working - age @entity1 are without a job , and the country faces a steep public deficit and only tepid economic growth
some immigrant workers are also leaving the country
entering the elections , voters told @entity2 the economy was their top priority
" this vote will determine the future of the country for years to come , " @entity81 , a university researcher , said after voting at the @entity83 school in central @entity0
in his initial speech sunday night , the @entity4 leader said he would not forget those suffering -- from recent university graduates who ca n't find jobs to small business owners struggling to stay afloat to those hit hard by illness or other tragedies -- as he shaped policies
" we 're going to try our best to better their situation , " he said
" and we 'll think of them before making a decision
" @entity3 has said he would not cut pensions -- which the incumbent @entity8 government earlier froze , to much criticism -- but he says all other issues are on the table in order to reduce the deficit
he has also said he 'll consider tax cuts for businesses to encourage them to hire more workers
a cabinet minister between 1996 and 2004 under conservative prime minister @entity112 , @entity3 twice lost to @entity8 leader @entity113 , in 2004 and 2008 , in his first attempts to become prime minister
but his conservative party swept to victory in regional and local elections last may , presaging what polls had long accurately predicted would be a triumph the third time around
@entity113 called the early election and announced he would not seek a third term
while other parties and candidates were in the race , @entity3 's chief challenger had been @entity10
the 60 - year - old served under former socialist prime minister @entity128 and most recently under @entity113 , rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and interior minister
@entity10 had warned that the conservatives would cut into public health and education , the social programs which he said the @entity8 would fight to preserve , despite the economic crisis
about 35 million @entity1 are eligible to vote , of whom the government claims 1.5 million are first - time potential voters , having turned 18 since the last general elections in 2008
the economic protests across @entity1 during the past six months have been fueled by the young -- the so called ' indignants ' -- but it was not clear how much impact the protesters had on the results sunday
@entity146 , a university student in his last year of journalism studies and who has been active in the protests , said : " i think it 's necessary to vote , but that 's not enough
people feel the elections wo n't change the situation
they wo n't stop the cutbacks
" @entity146 , 25 , sees his own prospects of getting a job after college as bleak
" i think there 's a pent - up rage
the workers and young people of this country are fed up , " @entity146 said
" it 's been years of frustration , over cutbacks and lower salaries
" putting the @entity169 nation on the right track wo n't be easy , @entity3 admitted in his speech to celebrating supporters later sunday night
but the incoming prime minister stressed he felt it was possible , especially if @entity1 joined forces to work toward a common goal
" that 's what it 's all about -- to be together , everybody , ( and ) work together , " he told the crowd
" our political project invites all @entity1 who want to resolve this situation
it means a lot of work , a lot of effort and a lot of unity
