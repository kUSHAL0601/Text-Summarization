@entity0 -- @entity3 lawmakers meeting in emergency session approved a motion friday to participate in airstrikes against @entity8 targets in @entity9
the 524 - 43 vote came after prime minister @entity11 told @entity12 that the country had a " duty to take part " in international efforts to combat the extremist group
the terror group is an organization of " staggering " brutality , he said , which has already killed one @entity3 hostage and threatens the lives of two more
" this is not a threat on the far side of the world , " he said , but one which menaces @entity26 nations directly
in addition to an @entity8 - inspired attack on a @entity35 museum in @entity36 earlier in the year , @entity26 's security agencies have disrupted six other @entity8 - linked plots , he said
@entity12 was recalled by @entity11 for the vote on military action in @entity9 , which was approved after lengthy debate in the @entity41 and @entity42
any proposal to expand the strikes to @entity45 would require additional action by @entity12 , according to the motion
@entity11 said @entity3 should join international allies in combating @entity8 , a campaign that he warned would take years , not months
" the hallmarks will be patience and persistence , not shock and awe , " he said
the government insists such action is legal because @entity9 's government has requested international help to tackle the @entity59 extremist group , which has overrun vast swathes of @entity9 and @entity45 and massacred religious minorities and @entity62
@entity11 made that point again friday , saying there was " no question " of the legality of action given the request by @entity9 's leaders and the broad international backing for the campaign against @entity8
some mps may be reluctant to back a bombing campaign in @entity9 because of doubts over its effectiveness or unhappiness over past @entity3 military intervention in @entity9
but action has been backed by the governing coalition of the conservatives and @entity81 , as well as the opposition @entity82
labour leader @entity83 told lawmakers the @entity3 " can not simply stand by " against the threat of @entity8
now that it 's been approved , military action could start within hours
@entity3 forces have already been taking part in surveillance missions over @entity9 , as well as aiding @entity91 forces with equipment
' past mistakes ' @entity11 acknowledged that the memory of going to war in @entity9 in 2003 , when @entity82 's @entity96 was prime minister , " hangs heavy " over the @entity41
" this is not 2003 , but we must not use past mistakes as an excuse for inaction , " he said
there is " no realistic prospect " of defeating @entity8 without military action , he said , and @entity3 has unique assets that no other coalition partner can offer , including precision missiles and surveillance capabilities
" it is also our duty to take part , " he said
" protecting the streets of @entity3 is not a task that we are prepared to entirely subcontract to other air forces of other countries
" last year , @entity11 suffered a painful defeat in the commons when mps voted against action in @entity45 in response to claims the @entity45 government had used chemical weapons against its own people
the motion approved by @entity12 on friday specifically rules out action in @entity45 unless a separate vote is held
it also rules out the use of @entity3 troops in any possible ground combat operations in @entity9
@entity11 : ' strong case ' for @entity45 action asked about the possibility of a change of approach to @entity45 , @entity11 said the situation there was " more complicated " than in @entity9 and that he was not going to change strategy right now
" @entity8 needs to be destroyed in @entity45 as well as @entity9 and we support the action the @entity140 and five @entity142 states have taken in @entity45 and i do believe there is a strong case for us to do more in @entity45 , " he said
" but i did not want to bring a motion to the house today which there was n't consensus for
" @entity3 foreign secretary @entity149 told @entity1 before the vote he was confident the @entity118 would approve @entity3 's participation in the @entity9 air campaign against @entity8 , but " there will be assurances that they want to receive
" on the likelihood of @entity3 's involvement in @entity45 , @entity149 said that it is not inevitable but that the possibility has n't been ruled out yet
the @entity140 and its coalition partners began bombing raids in @entity45 this week against @entity8 targets
@entity140 aircraft had already been carrying out airstrikes against @entity8 -- the group also known as @entity8 , which calls itself the @entity165 -- in @entity9 since last month
' haven for terrorism ' @entity83 , explaining his support for the motion , said that @entity8 ' ambition to create an @entity172 state risks destabilizing the region and make it more likely that @entity9 would become " a haven and training ground for terrorism " directed at the @entity3
he said some in the @entity41 may be wondering if this is a repeat of what happened in the run - up to the 2003 war in @entity9
" in my view , it is not , " he said , arguing the circumstances now are " demonstrably different
" on @entity45 , @entity83 differed from @entity11 's view , saying that he would want to see @entity187 authorization for action there before @entity3 stepped in
former defense secretary @entity189 , a conservative , said he believed there was a legal basis for action against @entity8 in @entity45 and that it should have been up for debate too
" @entity196 or later we are going to have to do it
it would have been far better if we had said so today , " he said
deputy prime minister @entity199 , the leader of the @entity81 , said earlier this week that his party would support the air campaign in @entity9 because it is legal and has been requested by the @entity9 government
also , he said , " it 's part of a much bigger coalition , a whole array of countries , crucially including a number of @entity142 countries which deprives @entity8 of the ability to somehow portray it as a ' @entity212 ' crusade
" hostage plea @entity8 beheaded a @entity3 hostage , aid worker @entity215 , earlier this month and continues to hold another @entity3 hostage , aid worker @entity217
the group has also released videos of the beheading of two @entity140 journalists , @entity222 and @entity223
@entity215 ' daughter , @entity224 , said that she would support airstrikes against @entity8
" ( @entity8 ) need eradicating , they ca n't continue this way , " she said
" they ca n't be doing this to people and getting away with it , no matter what nationality , if they 're western or not
hundreds of @entity45 have been killed by them , and they need to be stopped
and , if air strikes or ground force , or anything , is what it takes , that 's what it takes
" @entity242 leaders around the world have called for @entity217 's release
they include @entity245 , a judge on the @entity246 in @entity0 , who has said that " whatever your grievance with @entity140 or @entity3 foreign policy , executing this man is not the answer
" @entity8 has been ramping up its threats against the @entity140 and the @entity253
this summer , the group declared the establishment of a " caliphate , " an @entity258 state stretching across the territory it has conquered
@entity1 's @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .
