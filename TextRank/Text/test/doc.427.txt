one war was enough for @entity2
now 87 years old , he was a 16 - year - old @entity4 recruit when he fought in the @entity7 @entity6
as he fought the @entity9 in @entity10 , his family fled
" i did not show that i was @entity4 , " @entity2 says
" but it did not matter because people were being killed left and right
" this year , in @entity14 , he found himself again surrounded by war
@entity2 was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army
his old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military
his granddaughter @entity22 still marvels at his stories from the war
she is amazed that he managed to survive
suffering from alzheimer 's disease , a degenerative condition that impairs memory , he struggles to remember his own life sometimes , but he remembers the horrors of war
his eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word
or perhaps the right memory
his hands shake ever so slightly
it seems he knows he has lived a life
he is just trying to remember all the details
" people were hiding in shelters under the ground , " @entity22 says of the stories @entity2 once told
" they were being shot at point blank range
" " [ the @entity9 ] would have erased us from the @entity45 , " @entity2 remembers
" they attacked us and we fought back
" after the war , @entity2 settled in @entity47 in @entity14
then , decades later , he found himself in the middle of a war once again
" a missile fell and the house was destroyed
we were attacked , " @entity2 says
" @entity2 's family lived in a neighborhood next to the @entity47 airport , near some of the most intense fighting in @entity14 as @entity62 separatists battled the @entity64 army
@entity2 , who had survived one war , was able to survive another , even as the stray missile hit his house on february 10
it spared him , but it killed his daughter @entity71
" the moment it happened , we decided that 's it
here and now , we 're moving to @entity76 , " says @entity22
" this is the safest place
" @entity2 arrived in @entity76 on march 24
asked why the family waited to leave the war - torn region of @entity14 , @entity22 says they felt they would be fine in @entity47 , while @entity22 prayed for their safety from @entity76
" no matter how much we 're afraid of the next war here and as much as it 's not quiet here , it is the quietest place
" @entity2 came over in a wave of @entity4 immigration to @entity76 that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in @entity14
the @entity95 , an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for @entity76 , has brought 600 @entity97 to @entity76 since december , @entity2 among them
rabbi @entity99 , the fellowship 's founder , says , " we set up a refugee center
it 's the first time since the @entity104 that the @entity4 world has had to set up a refugee center for these jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go
" among the @entity4 moving to @entity76 , @entity99 says they have worked with approximately a dozen @entity104 survivors
on @entity116 , @entity76 's @entity112 that commemorates the @entity114 extermination of 6 million jews , these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy
jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now
" most of the [ @entity4 ] people in the @entity14 are @entity104 survivors or children of @entity104 survivors
these are the people who made it , who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the @entity104
" @entity2 was one of these people , able to survive the @entity104 as a soldier in the @entity126
his story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes , but it is impossible for his family to forget
