justice may be blind , but it 's easy to see that @entity6 's " @entity5 " is already a hit with fans
the pitch - black - dark new series streamed its entire first season on @entity9 on friday morning , and the early word is quite good
@entity11 is perfectly cast as blind attorney @entity5 , whose nights are consumed with cleaning up the @entity15 neighborhood of @entity16 while dressed in a black ninjaesque outfit
as the season unfolds , he heads toward a confrontation with @entity21 's @entity20 , a.k.a. the kingpin
two love interests enter @entity25 's life in the form of @entity27 ( @entity28 ) and @entity29 ( @entity30 )
oh , and there 's that red suit
so what do critics think ? quite a lot , with 94 % giving it positive reviews on @entity38
" @entity6 's ' @entity5 , ' @entity9 's latest offering , is a well - scripted , beautifully acted superhero saga that is surprisingly impressive , " said the @entity40 's @entity39
" the series stays incredibly faithful to @entity5 's pulp roots and does something delightfully unexpected -- trust its fans enough to spare us a long , drawn - out origin story , " said @entity43 of tv guide
early risers on @entity52 praised the show as well , especially @entity11 's performance , as well as a drawn - out , well - choreographed fight scene in episode 2
does @entity9 have a " @entity58 " - like hit on its hands ? @entity59 will tell .
