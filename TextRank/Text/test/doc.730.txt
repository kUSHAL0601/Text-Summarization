when i was elected to the @entity1 in 1967 , i became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body
five decades later , i find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation
but that is what @entity15 , who today declared he 's running for president of the @entity17 , is doing
his campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about " expanding the @entity22 " -- a message of inclusion
but those of us listening today who he is hoping to include , heard nothing more than hype
i 'm not buying it
since coming to the @entity30 , @entity15 has tried to sell himself as a different type of @entity22
he 's tried to brand himself as the @entity22 's minority outreach candidate
the problem for @entity15 , and the @entity22 at large , is that they do n't back up their words with their policies
yes , it 's about time that @entity22 started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle
but they ca n't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities
a quick survey of sen. @entity15 's positions makes clear that he does not
@entity15 kicked off his announcement speech in @entity51 by declaring " i have a message that is loud and clear : we have come to take our country back
" i have no doubt that under @entity15 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the @entity60 -- which @entity15 has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no @entity63 -- a department he thinks " should be done away with ; " when women did n't have choices -- choices @entity15 seeks to limit in @entity66 ; when @entity67 were n't protected from deportation -- protections @entity15 currently opposes
in his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities , he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency
but @entity15 has also questioned the @entity60 , and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate
when asked about the need for a more robust @entity77 following the @entity79 's dismantling of the law , @entity15 dismissively remarked , " we have an @entity82 - @entity17 president
" when president @entity83 stood with @entity84 and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the @entity88 last month to mark the 50th anniversary of @entity90 , he inspired us all by saying : " with effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity
... with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote
" @entity17 is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy , not less
unfortunately @entity15 has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle
@entity15 tried once again from that stage in @entity51 to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden @entity22 appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year
but his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated , outside of the mainstream , and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country
the @entity17 people deserve a leader who wo n't disrespect their intelligence , who wo n't pander to them when it 's convenient , and who wo n't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades
what i heard today , did n't change the facts about @entity15 's record
the @entity17 people deserve better than @entity15 .
