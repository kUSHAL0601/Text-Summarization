five young @entity2 feminists , whose detention has provoked an international outcry , may face up to five years in prison over their campaign for gender equality
the women were among detained on march 6 and march 7 in three @entity2 cities -- @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- shortly before events they had planned for @entity15 on march 8
@entity16 , the lawyer for one of the women , @entity17 , said police had recommended on april 6 that prosecutors press charges of " assembling a crowd to disturb public order
" @entity16 told @entity0 that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by monday
" we hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant , following the laws and standing up to pressure , " he said
" but nobody knows what to expect till monday ; we can do nothing but wait
" the five were initially held on suspicion of " picking quarrels and provoking trouble
" @entity16 said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed
" neither should constitute a crime , " he said
campaign group @entity41 said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years
" the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal
they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , " @entity47 , @entity2 researcher at @entity41 told @entity0
" everything they were doing was in line with @entity2 's own laws and policies
" @entity16 said that @entity17 had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on march 31
two of the women are said to be in poor health
he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for @entity15 and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women
the five -- who are members of @entity2 's @entity70 -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying " stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe " and " go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! " on women 's day
the detention of @entity17 , along with @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 has drawn harsh criticism from the international community
protests have taken place in several cities , including @entity88 , that urge @entity2 officials to " free the five
" a social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag
on monday , @entity94 , former @entity95 secretary of state , tweeted that the activists ' detention was " inexcusable
" her comment drew a rebuke from @entity2 authorities , who said public figures should respect @entity2 's sovereignty and independence
@entity105 , @entity2 researcher at @entity106 , said the activists were best known for their " performance art " style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women 's restrooms , donning blood - spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women
" these activists epitomize the spirit of the times
they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , " @entity16 said
as @entity2 prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark @entity126 in september , it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists , she added .
