two @entity3 screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at @entity6 , @entity1 police said
here 's how police say the scheme worked : when the male @entity3 officer noticed a man he found attractive , he would alert a female @entity3 officer
the female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through
and that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area , prompting the male @entity3 officer to pat down the passenger , police said , citing a @entity3 investigation
but during the patdown , the male @entity3 officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger 's front groin area and buttocks , which violates @entity3 policy
former @entity3 agent sentenced for recording coworker all this came to light after an anonymous tip from a @entity3 employee in november
the agency launched an investigation , and investigator @entity38 monitored the two @entity3 officers in question , @entity1 police said in a report
@entity38 watched the plan being carried out on february 9
he interviewed the female @entity3 officer , who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times , police said
both of the @entity3 officers investigated have been fired , @entity3 special agent @entity46 told police
authorities did not release their names
giant security gap at airports : lack of criminal background checks the @entity3 called the incident deplorable
" these alleged acts are egregious and intolerable , " the agency said in a written statement to @entity4
" all allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency
and when substantiated , employees are held accountable
" but it 's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim
the @entity3 said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the february incident but to no avail
the @entity3 said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the @entity1 airport
