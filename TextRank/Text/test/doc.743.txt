in her 40 years living in @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 had never seen a tornado that big
" i saw the top of the funnel cloud , and it was absolutely massive , " she said
she watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town thursday , tearing up its fringes
farther north , in the rural @entity2 hamlet of @entity14 , one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs
only the thickest branches remained standing
it was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns
but in nearby @entity27 , debris was so thick on the roads , responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries , fire officials said
on thursday , a video surfaced on @entity32 of a massive twister barreling across an open field , barely missing farmhouses and barns
images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media
multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural @entity41 on thursday
a large and dangerous twister tore across fields in @entity44
and a twister touched down 70 miles outside of @entity46
eight tornadoes were reported wednesday in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , the @entity47 said
but it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive
hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on @entity58 , @entity2
it could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of @entity63 and @entity64 -- the state 's third largest city
the tornado cut a 22 - mile path through @entity69 , according to disaster management coordinator @entity70
@entity73 , a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- @entity75
" it 's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants , " said @entity76 , who drove up in his truck to help out
" we 're a community
if one person is in need , we 'll all be there for them
" people were inside when the storm quashed @entity89 and turned over a semitruck parked outside
no one was killed or seriously injured , @entity76 said
although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour
people had been eating at @entity75 for some 25 years and will miss it , @entity76 said
in @entity1 , the tornado flattened some of @entity3 's friends ' homes
a safe distance away from it , at her mother 's house , she had to think about her husband , @entity104 , who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before
he 'd have a job ahead of him
" i have not been able to get a hold of him , @entity3 said , " but i know he 's in touch with the sheriff and is safe , " she said
sheriff @entity115 told journalists late thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in @entity69 aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable
the county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own
fifty to 100 houses had significant damage , he said
only foundations remained of some homes , said storm chaser @entity130
" you can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be , " he said
@entity135 , a reporter from @entity4 affiliate @entity136 , said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the @entity1 area
@entity115 was newly elected sheriff of @entity1 on wednesday
on thursday , the storm took his house and his sister - in - law 's
" i 've got the clothes on my back , " he said
but his family was n't at home when it hit
" my family was on the way to @entity153 , dog was in the basement and she survived
" it was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county
" i 've lived here all my life , am the fifth generation in the county
my mom said this is the first time she 's ever seen a tornado
" he is thankful that the @entity164 warned one could come
that saved lives , he believes
the service warned of a " particularly dangerous situation
" people across the @entity41 should be on alert for severe weather
tornado watches were set to run out early friday
@entity4 's @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .
