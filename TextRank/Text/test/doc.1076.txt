@entity1 on wednesday released more than 200 @entity3 , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the @entity7 terror organization overtook their towns in northern @entity9 last summer , officials said
most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said @entity14 , a commander in the @entity16 force that defends northern @entity9 's semi-autonomous @entity18 region
@entity14 did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that @entity22 tribal leaders helped to coordinate it
the freed yazidis were received by @entity16 , who sent them to the @entity18 regional capital , @entity26 , said @entity27 , an official with @entity9 's @entity28
it was n't immediately clear what motivated wednesday 's release , @entity27 said
@entity27 said 217 @entity3 were released
@entity14 , the @entity16 commander , had a higher count : 228
@entity1 previously released scores of other @entity3 -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year
the @entity7 militant group steamrolled into @entity9 's north last summer , forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- yazidis among them -- from their homes
@entity3 are of @entity18 descent , and their religion is considered a @entity48 sect that draws from @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52
one of the oldest religious communities in the world , the @entity3 have long suffered persecution , with many @entity56 referring to them as devil worshipers
@entity1 ' cruelty to them has been extraordinary
@entity1 ' conquest of the town of @entity61 , in particular , provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some @entity3 fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring @entity68
@entity1 slaughtered @entity3 by the hundreds , @entity69 , the only lawmaker representing the @entity3 in @entity9 's @entity70 , told @entity2 last year
reports emerged from some @entity3 survivors that @entity1 raped and enslaved female @entity3 captives
an international coalition responded , first by airdropping supplies in the mountains
and then , starting in august , the @entity78 and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting @entity1 in @entity9 and @entity68
the @entity81 estimates that 500,000 @entity3 live in northern @entity9 , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population
@entity2 's @entity84 reported from @entity85
@entity2 's @entity86 wrote from @entity87
@entity2 's @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 contributed to this report .
