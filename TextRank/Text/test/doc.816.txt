@entity2 , @entity3 ten people have been sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the 2012 attack on @entity10 - winning activist @entity9 , a judge announced thursday
the assailant 's conviction and sentences follow a trial that included testimony from both sides , according to @entity3 antiterrorism judge @entity17
the 10 were arrested in @entity19 , a district of @entity3 's @entity21 province , @entity3 army spokesman maj. gen. @entity18 said last september
that was nearly two years after the then 15 - year - old @entity9 -- who was despised by @entity24 militants for her outspoken support of girls ' right to an education -- was shot as she was traveling home on a school bus
she not only survived that attack , but went on to become an even more vocal international activist
in fact , her efforts helped earn her the @entity10 -- which she shared with @entity36 's @entity35 -- last year
@entity9 at @entity37 : the @entity24 failed to silence us journalist @entity39 reported from @entity2 , and @entity4 's @entity40 wrote this story from @entity42 .
