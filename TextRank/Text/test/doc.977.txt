@entity0 decision time for @entity4 operatives , another controversial foreign policy choice for president @entity6 , a ripple effect from the @entity9 indictment , and two insights into @entity12 's campaign launch -- those stories filled our sunday trip around the " @entity17 " table
@entity6 's @entity19 diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up , and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead
the president is headed to @entity22 for a regional summit , and @entity24 of @entity25 reports one of the big questions is whether he 'll make history and have a face - to - face meeting with @entity31 leader @entity30
" this would be the first meeting between a @entity34 and a @entity31 leader in decades , " said @entity24
" but @entity6 's efforts to end this freeze of @entity31 have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year , " @entity24 said
" and so what the @entity40 is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the @entity44
" @entity12 has leased her headquarters space in @entity46 and will soon make her presidential campaign official
and with the launch , @entity48 of the @entity49 reports , will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce @entity52 -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children 's issues
" the democrats around @entity12 believe that while she 's one of the most famous people in the world , she 's never been properly introduced in her own right , " said @entity48
" so when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks , look for more biographical touches
we 'll hear about her childhood in suburban @entity67 and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the @entity70 and the @entity71 when she was in her 30s , and also , more about her @entity72 days as first lady , as an advocate for education
" a lot of the big names signing on to @entity52 are already known
but @entity78 of the @entity79 explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large , experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles
" what i 'm hearing is that when they launch , this staff is going to be even much , much bigger than we , at this point , imagine , that they have done a huge amount of hiring , " said @entity78
and @entity78 reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction
" she did an event with the wife of the mayor of @entity102 earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they 're doing
" much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against @entity109 sen. @entity9 of @entity110 has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends
but beyond the more tabloidesque details , @entity115 of @entity116 notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator 's staff was soliciting funds for a so - called super pac -- a violation of campaign finance laws
and she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the @entity9 allegations
" i was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the ( @entity131 ) really starts to look into this , they 're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than @entity9 , " said @entity115
" so watch for that if it starts happening
" by a week from monday , there will be three official @entity4 candidates for president : @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142
others will soon follow , and as things get more official , pressure is mounting on @entity4 operatives to choose sides
in @entity151 this past week , @entity148 , a former @entity149 alum with ground organizing experience , signed on with @entity110 gov. @entity153 's team
others in the state reported calls coming in from @entity158 gov. @entity157 and , yes , even @entity159
this dynamic plays out on the national level , too : @entity4 pollster @entity163 , for example , was approached both by @entity164 and by allies of @entity167 gov. @entity166
in the end , though , @entity163 signed on with sen. @entity141 of @entity169 , who makes his official announcement on tuesday .
