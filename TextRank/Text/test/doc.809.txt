@entity1 , @entity2 we are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight
the migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to @entity2 has been brewing for years , but in the past 10 days , with as many as 1,600 deaths in the @entity13 , suddenly minds are focused -- for now
almost exactly four years ago , in @entity15 , i caught , perhaps , a glimpse of what was to come
it was late at night in the besieged city of @entity20
hundreds of @entity22 migrants were caught between the @entity15 civil war ( back then some optimistically called it a " revolution " ) and the deep blue sea
they had come to @entity20 from @entity27 , @entity28 and elsewhere , hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to @entity31
they had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces , but were n't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city
they appealed to us to help them escape
we could do nothing , but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided
the fall of @entity15 leader @entity46 's regime , which we reporters covered so avidly , was followed by chaos , which we in the news media largely neglected , focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe , the @entity53 civil war
in that chaos , the business of human trafficking has boomed
and now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of @entity61
the focus today is on those lost at sea
aware of the tragedy underway , however , @entity61 are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in @entity31 , according to one @entity70 official
that is certainly the case in the @entity2 port of @entity1 , where many migrants arrive
the city 's mayor , @entity75 , insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants , but says @entity1 , and @entity2 can not absorb the ever - growing numbers
the rest of @entity31 must help carry the burden
" if something serious is n't done , " he warns , " dramas like these will be repeated
this problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand
" increasingly , some @entity61 are losing their patience
two northern regions , @entity93 and @entity94 , have declared they will no longer accept new migrants
the rightist @entity96 has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program
others , however , insist @entity61 must keep its doors open
in @entity1 port , i spoke with @entity106 , who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants
" many years ago , our grandparents emigrated , " she recalled
" let 's keep that in mind
" indeed , in tougher times , millions of impoverished @entity61 left their homeland to settle in the @entity117 and @entity118
they , too , like the migrants from @entity22 and the @entity120 , were fleeing grinding poverty and war
and they , too , experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home
that 's the long view , perhaps
but now , today , @entity61 are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills , ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption , hopeless poverty , oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan , expensive and politically daunting effort
and while this crisis has been brewing for years , it is now truly upon us .
