@entity1 , @entity0 the bad news ? the deadline to agree on what will be the parameters for an endgame pact on @entity9 's nuclear program has come and gone with no deal
the good news ? the sides are still talking
whether your glass is half - full or half - empty , it does n't change the fact that it 's not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations
nor does it change the fact that tuesday 's self - imposed deadline did n't really matter anyway : the date that really counts is june 30 , when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal -- with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out -- or else everything falls apart
the whole point of what 's happening in @entity1 , @entity0 , is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement
for those hoping that will eventually happen , it 's good that @entity9 foreign minister @entity41 , @entity43 secretary of state @entity42 and senior @entity45 diplomat @entity44 held talks early thursday morning in @entity1
but it does n't mean there will be a final deal
" we have made significant progress over the last few days , but it has been slow going , " @entity51 foreign secretary @entity50 told reporters wednesday
" i 'm optimistic that we will make further progress ... but it does mean the @entity9 being willing to meet us where there are still issues to deal with
" fingers crossed , and we 'll hope to get there during the course of the day
" but by thursday morning , there was still no deal
@entity41 told reporters that @entity9 has shown " its readiness to engage with dignity , and it 's time for our negotiating partners to seize the moment and use this opportunity , which may not be repeated
" " i 've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together
they are mutually exclusive , " the @entity9 minister said
" so our friends need to decide whether they want to be with @entity9 based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure
they have tested the other one
it is high time to test this one
" @entity85 official @entity84 said on @entity86 that talks between @entity42 and @entity41 ran deep into the early hours of thursday morning
" that was truly an all - nighter , " she tweeted around 6 a.m. local time ( 12 a.m. et ) , saying the negotiations had broken up and would resume again in a few hours
â€Ž another @entity43 official had said earlier that " some serious issues remain unresolved
" " it is still totally unclear when this might happen , if it happens at all
" there 's one thing that most everyone does agree on : the sides have made progress in recent days
in fact , @entity41 called it " very good " progress that led to solutions on most issues , according to @entity107 , the state - run @entity107
as long as " the conversations continue to be productive , " @entity111 press secretary @entity110 said , @entity43 officials will keep on talking
@entity114 foreign minister @entity113 -- whose country has been taking part in the talks , along with @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity51 and the @entity45 -- went so far as to say " with a large degree of confidence " that " framework agreements have been reached on all the key aspects of this issue at the ministerial level
" " we hope that these agreements will be put on paper in the next few hours or a day at the most , " @entity113 said before leaving the talks along with his counterparts from @entity127 and @entity119
" the agreement stipulates a comprehensive approach to settling this issue , including @entity135 verification of the exclusively peaceful nature of @entity9 's nuclear program and detailed provisions on lifting the sanctions
" but it does n't matter if @entity114 or @entity118 is comfortable with the details ; the key is getting the @entity43 and @entity9 on the same page , something that 's hard given the decades of contempt and distrust
according to an @entity107 report , @entity41 said only that he hopes a framework agreement will be drafted wednesday
" i think it 's a matter of political will
it 's not just about technical details anymore , " said @entity151 , a professor of @entity153 studies at the @entity154
" you 're talking here about an institutionalized relationship of hostility between the @entity43 and @entity9
" even then , @entity161 on wednesday gave the sides a 60 % to 70 % chance of coming to some sort of preliminary agreement soon
his reasoning : " i think there is a convergence of interests between @entity172 's administration and the @entity9 leadership , and that 's why both camps have a vested interest in signing an agreement , as opposed to walking away
" for @entity9 , which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , a deal would mean relief from punishing economic sanctions
for the @entity184 , it would offer hope of improved relations with @entity187 without the destabilizing threat of an @entity9 nuclear bomb in the pipeline
the sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years
that 's why @entity9 is facing crippling sanctions in the first place : because many world powers felt they could not trust @entity187 , given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks
the tone changed with the 2013 election of @entity9 president @entity203 , a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions
and there has been some movement , including in recent days , out of @entity9
still , it 's too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything
@entity213 , a professor of @entity215 studies at @entity216 , told @entity2 that @entity9 officials feel they 've already compromised a lot in the talks
" they feel that they 've gone as far as they possibly can and that it 's for the @entity43 right now to make a move , " he said
21 questions on @entity9 nuclear talks the main sticking points at the moment are believed to be the pace at which @entity231 sanctions on @entity9 will be lifted , how much nuclear research and development @entity9 will be able to maintain and whether @entity9 will ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for reprocessing into a safer form
even if those points are resolved to the satisfaction of all sides , any agreement is expected to come under attack on multiple fronts
@entity172 is likely to face a stern challenge selling any deal to @entity246 , while hardliners in @entity9 will probably denounce it for being too harsh
the leader of @entity249 , a key @entity43 ally that considers @entity9 to be an existential threat , on tuesday said " the agreement that is being formed in @entity1 is paving the road to that result
" and on wednesday , @entity249 prime minister @entity255 obliquely suggested that the @entity43 could be threatened as well
" @entity153 is plagued by @entity257 , anti-democratic and @entity258 extremism
... despots lead their people in chants of ' @entity262 ' while building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach @entity43
in this violent and unstable region , where states are exploding , " said @entity255 , referring to some @entity9 leaders and reports that @entity9 could develop intercontinental missiles
@entity9 's power rises , with or without deal @entity172 administration officials say that any agreement would involve heavy monitoring of @entity9 's nuclear activities
they insist no deal would be better than signing a bad deal
but if no agreement is reached and the talks fall apart , the potential consequences are deeply unsettling
further sanctions on @entity9 would most likely follow
@entity249 argues that could eventually force @entity187 back to the negotiating table to settle for a tougher deal
but @entity172 administration officials say they fear @entity9 will redouble efforts to advance its nuclear program without any meaningful international inspections
@entity9 progress toward a nuclear weapon could spark an arms race in the @entity153 and talk of military strikes from the @entity43 or @entity249
" the military option will remain on the table , " @entity43 defense secretary @entity292 told @entity294 's " today " show on tuesday
" if there is a good agreement to have , obviously it 's worth waiting for and completing the negotiations
