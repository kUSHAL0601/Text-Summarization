would a taste of the finest @entity2 chocolate make you happy ? or soaking in the warm @entity6 springs ? perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in @entity9 is for you ? it 's not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy , according to the third @entity15 , released by the @entity16 for the @entity17 on april 23
people who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support , experience more generosity , have more freedom to make life choices , have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita , the report shows
the tiny country of @entity30 , a very happy country famous for measuring the " @entity31 " of its people , gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness : its prime minister proposed the idea of a @entity40 to the @entity17 in 2011
recognizing " happiness and well - being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world , " the @entity41 declared march 20 as @entity40 in 2012
this officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month
through the happiness report , the @entity16 hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people 's happiness
" there is no single key to happiness , " said @entity53 , the network 's director and an economics professor at @entity56
" all of these countries do well in several ways
being rich ? that 's good , but it 's only a modest part of the story
trusting society , having a government that ranks on low in corruption , a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness
" even if you do n't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world , a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day
here are the top 10 happiest places on @entity84 , according to the @entity15
@entity2 @entity2 took the top spot from @entity9 in 2015 , rising from third to first place in this year 's list of the world 's happiest countries
@entity90 , the capital city of @entity2 , has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a @entity96
since the city 's founding in the 12th century , it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion
and the lovely @entity100 offers in - town swimming and boating
looking to get out of the capital city ? book a trip to @entity105 , where you can take a boat trip on the lake , ride the panorama gondola , take in the views on the new @entity112 aerial cableway and ride on the world 's steepest cog railway
book the @entity116 trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the @entity119 -- in one day
( the railway reopens in mid-may
) and no matter where you go , there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try
@entity126 nature and culture combine to make @entity126 a truly happy place , so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year
explore @entity126 , where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document @entity126 's 10th - and 11th - century history are remembered
a two - hour drive from the capital city of @entity139 , south @entity126 is home to @entity141 , the 60 - meter ( 197 - foot ) @entity142 and amazing fresh seafood
( though you could probably skip the fermented shark ... ) no matter where you visit , there 's probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring
and when you get back to the capital , note that the renowned annual @entity153 will take place from may 17 through june 7
@entity9 never mind that @entity9 lost the top spot this year and is now the third - happiest country in the world
looking at all that @entity9 have to be happy about , you wo n't notice the slight dip while you 're enjoying jazz at the @entity161 in july , hanging out with the hipsters at @entity163 , taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the @entity167
prefer your music in the woods ? @entity170 to @entity171 ( " @entity175 " ) , a rock / pop festival in the woods of @entity174 held in august
wherever you go , enjoy that @entity9 tradition of " hygge , " sometimes translated too simply as the need for " coziness
" it 's really a complex sense of intimacy , community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family , and it makes for one happy country
