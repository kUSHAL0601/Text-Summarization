i come and i feel honored and i feel safe and that i belong , but now i feel like i 'm defending myself , " wounded veteran @entity15 told @entity0 affiliate @entity16
" people were urinating off the balconies , throwing up in the elevators , making suggestive and sexual comments about veterans with their service dogs and derogatory and suggestive comments about their wives , " said @entity17 , organizer of the @entity18

" on behalf of our entire organization , i want to apologize to veterans , both those who were in @entity7 , and those who have felt the pain from afar , as well as to their families and all who support the @entity18 and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees
" " i am personally offended and disappointed by the behavior that has been described to me , " @entity60 vice president @entity59 said

" a reporter for @entity0 affiliate @entity67 went to the @entity1 fraternity house on friday seeking comment from members
nobody answered her knock on the door or would talk when she approached them in the parking lot
do fraternities make men behave badly ? @entity2 issued a statement saying it was appalled to hear of the disrespectful acts but said " no evidence has been found to implicate @entity2 students in these reported incidents
" @entity17 said the @entity82 stayed at the same resort where the fraternities were having their spring formal
she said the fraternity members had too much to drink the night of april 17
" we had an @entity88 flag flying outside and there was urination coming down from the balconies going onto the flag , " she said
" one of the drunk kids pulled a veteran @entity88 flag out of the ground and [ we ] made the boy put it back
this all happened friday afternoon , through the night , into the late morning
" she said the veterans and their families did not retaliate
" these men and women acted like the leaders they are of our country , " she said
@entity17 told @entity16 she received an apology letter from the @entity1 president and the president of @entity5 at that school
the website for @entity5 says it 's the the world 's first @entity113 fraternity and prides itself on being an inclusive organization
