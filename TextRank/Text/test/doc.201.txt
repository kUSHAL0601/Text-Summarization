@entity0 is discouraging its members from participating in executions
on monday , the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy , stating that " such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers
" this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term " drug " for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases
the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said @entity25 , spokeswoman for the @entity0
that spotlight includes a january @entity28 decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in @entity31
this was prompted by @entity34 's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack
in @entity39 last month , the execution of female death row inmate @entity38 was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy
thirty - two sates allow capital punishment , and lethal injection is still the most common method
last month , @entity46 gov. @entity45 signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available
of the eight inmates currently on death row in @entity46 , three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad
@entity58 is the preferred drug used for lethal injection
in @entity62 , the department of criminal justice told @entity1 in march they are running out of their supply
in july 2011 , @entity64 , the manufacturer of pentobarbital , decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment
the companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose , so states then turned to compounded preparations , @entity25 said
" pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way
the new declaration by the @entity0 aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the @entity87 , the @entity88 and the @entity89 .
