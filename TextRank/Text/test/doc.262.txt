the cast of " @entity2 " escaped from principal @entity4 30 years ago , but a draft script of the 1985 teen classic has just been found in a filing cabinet in the school district where it was filmed , the @entity0 reported
" one day a few weeks ago , one of the assistants was going through a filing cabinet and found a file that had a manuscript from ' @entity19 ' dated sept. 21 , 1983 , " @entity10 , superintendent of @entity11 in suburban @entity12 , told the newspaper
" it 's a first draft of the screenplay by @entity22 , " @entity10 said
the manuscript sports the approval signature of the district 's then - superintendent and reveals that @entity27 's character , @entity19 , was originally to be named @entity28 , according to the @entity0
the movie was filmed at the @entity31 building , which was auctioned off by the district years ago and is now occupied by the @entity33 , according to the @entity0
the file was discovered at @entity35 as district officials prepared to move to a newly acquired building next door
@entity10 told the @entity0 that he would like to find a way to display the script as a piece of film -- and district -- history
" the odds of having such an iconic movie filmed and associated with your district are astronomical , " he told the newspaper
