for the first time in eight years , a tv legend returned to doing what he does best
contestants told to " come on down ! " on the april 1 edition of " @entity6 " encountered not host @entity7 but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings
instead , there was @entity12 , who hosted the tv game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007
looking spry at 91 , @entity12 handled the first price - guessing game of the show , the classic " @entity15 , " before turning hosting duties over to @entity7 , who finished up
despite being away from the show for most of the past eight years , @entity12 did n't seem to miss a beat .
