duckie 's still got moves
on tuesday night 's " @entity4 " on @entity5 , actor @entity3 reprised the character 's record - store dance to @entity8 's " try a @entity9 , " right down to the wall - dancing , the counter-bashing and , of course , the trademark white shoes
in the original scene , one of the best - loved bits from the 1986 @entity19 film , @entity3 dances around a record store , lip - syncing the song as he tries to win the affection of @entity24 's @entity23
in tuesday 's recreation , he dances in tandem with host @entity27 , who tweeted that he 'd " fulfilled a childhood dream " by re-creating the scene with @entity3 -- who turned 50 on thursday
" i watched that ' try a @entity9 ' dance routine so many times , the tape on the @entity31 wore out , " @entity27 said on the show
like @entity3 , who has most recently appeared on " @entity36 , " many of the film 's original fans are well into middle age
but still some may have squealed like teenagers when they saw the routine .
