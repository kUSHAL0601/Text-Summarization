@entity3 , @entity1 it is an unimaginably hideous outcome
to be raped by your cousin 's husband ; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married ; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault , but be pardoned by presidential decree ; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame
the solution in this society ? marry your attacker
that 's what happened to @entity24 , who was barely 16 when she was raped
she 's now carrying the third child of her attacker , @entity27 , who was convicted and jailed -- though this was then reduced
@entity24 's plight -- like so much in beleaguered @entity1 -- disappeared from the world 's gaze once she was pardoned and released courtesy of a presidential pardon
instead of a new start , what followed for @entity24 was a quiet , @entity1 solution to the " problem " -- a telling sign of where women 's rights stand in @entity1 despite the billions that have poured into this country from the @entity44 government and its @entity46 allies during more than a decade of war
we found @entity24 in her family home
smile , the name of the daughter born of the rape , is now a shining little girl , bouncing around the house that her mother shares with @entity27 's first wife -- who is also @entity24 's cousin
@entity27 agreed to let us speak with him and @entity24 because , it seemed , he wanted to show us that things were now settled , that under @entity1 's version of social morality he had done the right thing
he had rescued @entity24 from shame
" if i had n't married her , ( but ) according to our traditions , she could n't have lived back in society , " he tells us
" her brothers did n't want to accept her back
now , she does n't have any of those problems
" 2011 : thousands sign petition for @entity71 release @entity24 remains subdued throughout our meeting and does not once look her husband in the eye
" i did n't want to ruin the life of my daughter or leave myself helpless so i agreed to marry him , " she says
" we are traditional people
when we get a bad name , we prefer death to living with that name in society
" as @entity85 attempts to pour tea , the other seven children in this household run around the courtyard
the first wife remains unseen in the house
a portrait of @entity24 's liberator in 2011 , the then - president @entity92 , hangs on the wall
but the sense of order here is undermined by the fact that this is a house built around a crime
how @entity24 ended up here requires some explanation
there was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release
but at the same time , other activists were trying to assist her with an asylum bid abroad
" unfortunately , @entity24 was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which , in and of itself , was immensely disappointing , " her former attorney , an @entity44 citizen named @entity109 , tells us
" @entity24 was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry ... @entity24 essentially became a prisoner of her environment
" as an uneducated , young , single mother with no family support , it would have been an uphill battle for @entity24 and her daughter
" local pressure won out
she was introduced to her attacker in the shelter where @entity2 first interviewed her upon release from prison
they talked and it was agreed she would marry him
most disturbingly , the woman who -- despite knowing the stigma it would create around her -- defiantly insisted she had been raped when we spoke nearly four years ago , now says she was told by her relatives to make up the allegations
" now she is beside me and knows that it was not as big as they had shown it , " says @entity27
" no i am not thinking about it anymore , " @entity24 adds
" i do n't have a problem with him now and i do n't want to think about the past problems
my life is ok ... i am happy with my life ... it is going on
" she is then permitted to talk with us alone
@entity27 moves away but stands close to the door of the room
though she now maintains she was not raped , she explains her decision
she contradicts her husband , saying her brothers would have taken her back , had she not married him
" my brothers opposed the marriage and told me to take my daughter and go to @entity154 to live with them instead , " she says
" but now we 're married , they disowned me and wo n't see me again
" her decision was for her daughter
" no , i could n't fulfill my wishes in life
i married this man ; i cut relations with my family only to buy my daughter 's future
" it is truly chilling to see how things have gone for @entity24 after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist , accepting a life as his second wife , trapped in his home .
