a professor at @entity1 said in an email to his strategic management students that they were a disgrace , that they lacked maturity -- and that he would fail the entire class
@entity8 , an instructional associate professor in the university 's department of maritime administration , told @entity2 affiliate @entity12 that he had finally reached a breaking point
" @entity14 was enough , " @entity8 said
" it became apparent that they could n't do just some of the most simple and basic things that they should 've been able to do at that point
" in the email to students , @entity12 reported , @entity8 said : " i have seen cheating , been told by students to ' chill out , ' ' get out of my space , ' ' go back and teach ' refuse to leave the room after being told to do so following inappropriate conduct , called a ' f * * * * * g moron ' several times by a student to my face ... " @entity8 added that students spread hurtful rumors about him , his wife and colleagues , and that he felt the need for police protection in class
@entity36 , a senior at @entity1 and student in @entity8 's class , told @entity12 he was worried about the job he has lined up after graduation
" just ridiculous , because , i mean , i had never had a problem in the class , " @entity36 said
" i thought i had done pretty well , done pretty well on the first test and everything else that 's going on
i get an email saying i am going to get an @entity46 in the class , and just kind of -- it was overwhelming
" @entity1 is a part of the @entity50 ; its more than 2,000 students focus on marine and maritime studies
@entity53 , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer , told @entity12 that the university will not necessarily stand by the failing grades @entity8 planned to hand out
@entity58 officials said the department head will take over teaching the strategic management class
" none of them have failed until the end of the class , meaning the only reason a student would fail is because he or she has n't performed the actual , you know , with the expectations for that particular class , " @entity53 said
university officials have not yet responded to @entity2 's request for comment .
