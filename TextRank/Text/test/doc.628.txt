@entity1 president @entity0 shrugged off repeated questions about the impact of @entity6 sanctions on his nation during a nationally broadcast annual q&a session
" sanctions are sanctions , " he said
" as far as sanctions are concerned ...
( they 're ) about the need to constrain our development , " not just about @entity15 and @entity16
@entity6 sanctions were implemented after @entity18 annexed @entity16 and @entity20 separatists battled @entity15 government forces in the nation 's east
@entity0 predicted the sanctions would not end soon
on the @entity26 , the @entity1 leader defended lifting a ban on the sale of a sophisticated air defense system to @entity30
" we need to encourage our @entity30 partners , " @entity0 said , referring to a preliminary deal to limit @entity30 's nuclear program
sanctions against @entity30 have had a dramatic impact on the nation 's economy
on @entity40 and @entity6 fears that such a system would embolden @entity30 , @entity0 scoffed
" @entity30 is not a threat to @entity40 at all , " he said
" it is a defense weapon
" @entity0 's annual exercise is fascinating for ordinary @entity1 , who normally get him in closely managed doses on state - run television
these sessions are live and can go on and on
last year , he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes
in 2013 , it was a record - setting four hours and 47 minutes
organizers said public interest was especially strong this year , with 2.4 million questions submitted
of course , critics of the @entity53 slam the entire event as @entity1 's imitation of democracy in action
it 's hard to imagine a truly critical question , they say , getting aired on national television there
in fact , it 's best not to look at this event as an opportunity for @entity1 to question their leader at all
instead , it is more like a highly produced , highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them , and to the world
last year , there was a " surprise " appearance by @entity75 whistle - blower @entity74 , who was granted asylum in @entity1
he addressed @entity0 by video link , quizzing @entity0 about @entity18 's own surveillance practices .
