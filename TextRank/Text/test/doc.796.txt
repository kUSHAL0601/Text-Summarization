two years ago in a less turbulent time , @entity0 and @entity1 launched a small business , @entity5 , in their @entity7 town
the two were successful in getting their line of frozen pizzas , including breakfast pizzas and gluten - free options , in stores across @entity14 , west of @entity15
they grew a base of loyal customers
but all that was threatened this week when people began mistaking them for @entity21 of @entity22 , @entity23 , which made national headlines after its owners said they would refuse to cater a same - sex wedding
people posted angry comments on @entity5 's @entity30 page and called its phone number to protest
and almost overnight , @entity0 and @entity1 found themselves thrust unwillingly into a national debate over @entity23 's controversial @entity35
" my stomach was in my throat all afternoon , " @entity1 told @entity2 affiliates @entity36 and @entity38
" all of a sudden , our @entity30 page started getting flooded , " @entity0 said
it was like i was a rat running around in a cage , wondering what 's going on here
" in a cruel coincidence , the flood of outrage began on wednesday , @entity50
" if i 'm ever in the area , i 'll be sure to starve to death before i give you and you intolerance any of my money ! " wrote one commenter on @entity30
" i do n't have much of a message , except that i hope your bigotry puts you out of business very quickly , " a man said in a voice mail
@entity23 pizzeria finds itself at the center of ' religious freedom ' debate @entity0 thinks the firestorm was sparked by people googling " @entity21 " and confusing the two businesses -- despite the fact that @entity14 and @entity22 are in separate states and almost 300 miles apart
he and @entity1 tried to defuse the outcry with a @entity30 post saying in part , " we are not that company in @entity23 , nor do we agree or condone their words or actions
" in response , they began getting messages of support on @entity30 , along with a few sharp - tongued comments from supporters of the other @entity21
@entity0 said he also got a call from a man whose initial post may have set off the social media storm , apologizing for the mistake
still , he worries that damage to his wholesale pizza business may have been done
" this misinformation and this defamation of character could cause me to lose the business over someone else 's identity in another state , " he said .
