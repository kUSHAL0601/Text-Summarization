a video shoot in @entity2 for an @entity4 comedy series took a serious turn on saturday as the earth began rumbling
the @entity2 @entity7 were in the middle of shooting an episode for their hidden camera series when the magnitude - 7.8 earthquake broke out
the team kept the camera rolling as they moved through the crowded streets , surveying destruction to homes and historic sites and capturing scenes of heroism and chaos
the @entity2 @entity7 ' videos show people 's reactions to various " pranks " that challenge cultural norms
one video shows the pranksters walking up to strangers and taking their hands for a long , awkward , handshake ; another shows them complimenting men and women on their clothes and appearance , with mixed results
for their next prank based on @entity2 's ban on plastic bags , @entity43 and @entity38 were in @entity44 , @entity38 said in an email to @entity1
the town , in @entity46 , is home to @entity2 's famed @entity49
the camera was rolling when they felt the ground shaking around 11:55 a.m. , @entity38 said
people started screaming and crying and vehicles came to a standstill as a building collapsed in the background
but earthquakes are a fact of life in @entity2 , and " we were still thinking it was a just a simple earthquake , " @entity38 said
they kept the camera rolling for 18 minutes as they traversed the streets full of crying and shouting people
they found homes destroyed , where people were pulling survivors out from piles of rubble
they stopped and talked to motorists , urging them to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles , @entity38 said
they continued filming as they made their way to to the historic @entity82 tower and @entity83 , a @entity85 world heritage site , where people crawled among the ruins
by then , they realized their country was in a " very bad condition , " @entity38 said
the @entity2 @entity7 made it through the first day of the earthquake , as did their families , @entity38 said
but with aftershocks and crumbling infrastructure still posing threats , safety is a temporary state of mind right now in @entity2
... @entity102 waves are occurring now , " he said
" hope we will be alive and the problem will get solved soon
