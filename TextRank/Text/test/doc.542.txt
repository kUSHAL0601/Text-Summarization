he 's been part of a wildly popular superhero team since its very beginning
but there 's something we never knew about @entity8 , @entity9 of the x-men
wednesday 's issue of " @entity12 " no. 40 reveals the truth : @entity8 is gay
" there are thousands if not millions of stories of people who , for many different reasons , felt the need to hide their sexuality , " @entity14 , who wrote the issue , said in a statement to @entity1

in comic book pages provided to @entity1 , @entity8 does n't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth
the character of @entity9 is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the " x-men " films , as well as the 1981 animated series " @entity51
" the " x-men " series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity , with a black female character , storm , appearing in the 1970s , and the first gay mainstream comic book character , @entity59 ( who later married in the pages )
@entity62 has also had prominent gay characters in recent years , like @entity64 and the original @entity65 of @entity66
catwoman recently came out as bisexual , and @entity68 is portrayed that way as well
@entity14 further shared his thoughts on @entity72 about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on tuesday : " i swear on my dogs , i wanted the issue to come out and just be
