last month @entity0 was taken into custody for planning to protest on @entity3 against sexual harassment in @entity5
since then , the @entity5 authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for " creating disturbances
" they also briefly detained some of the activists ' supporters , raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release , and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment , lawyers and adequate rest
the fate of the five will be revealed by april 13 , as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or " formally arrested , " which almost always leads to conviction in @entity5 's legal system
the timing of the detentions of @entity5 's most inventive women 's rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women 's achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which @entity38 would have won praise for its role in promoting women 's rights
it appears poised to adopt its first and long - awaited anti-domestic violence law , which is expected to get a reading before the @entity46 this summer
this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential @entity48 hosted in @entity38 , during which @entity49 famously declared that " women 's rights are human rights
" i first met @entity0 at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in @entity5 's weiquan or " rights defense " movement
it was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as " babes " or " little sisters , " even in professional — and ostensibly progressive — settings
as women 's rights activists , @entity0 and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the @entity5 government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second - class citizens
by the time we met again two years later , @entity0 and her young " direct - action " feminist colleagues were clearly off and running
they staged small , public " performance art " protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women 's rights movement , and pushed women 's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government 's agenda
@entity0 had an upbringing typical of her times
she comes from the countryside , which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes
in recent decades the economy has soared , but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth : pollution , unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor
like many parents , she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy , and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter , safer upbringing
many in @entity110 and her colleagues ' generation are clear - eyed about the problems of @entity5 's development model , and some want to address those
@entity0 joined @entity117 , a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality , whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities , and later founded the women 's rights organization @entity123
and it is in @entity125 that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern @entity5
@entity0 and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor — " occupying " public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women , donning blood - spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence , shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women — that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate , especially with young women in the country
perhaps this is what the government finds threatening : that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times
they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , and most importantly , they feel responsible for their society and they want to improve it
as @entity5 prepares to mark the anniversary of the @entity48 in september , it will be harder for the authorities to justify detaining these activists
but even if they are released , their work promoting women 's rights will have become exponentially more difficult
the women will now be labeled " sensitive " individuals at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about independent groups , their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments ( known as " color revolutions " ) , and foreign funding of civil society organizations
what @entity0 and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism
authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists , and imprisoned others , but they have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable , so long as they abandon their activism
this kind of " differentiated management " of nongovernmental organizations — punishing some but co-opting others — may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups
but ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make @entity0 and her friends ' campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through " authoritarian activism " alone
the @entity201 now faces a dizzying array of challenges , not least that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations
rather than lengthening its list of challenges , the party could resolve some and lessen concerns about its legitimacy by freeing and engaging activists like @entity0 and her colleagues , rather than treating them as criminals .
