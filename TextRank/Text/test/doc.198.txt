@entity0 a bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in @entity4 about the potential for terrorism involving drones
a drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of @entity4 's equivalent to the @entity15 on wednesday , police and government officials said
the discovery came on the same day a @entity4 court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the @entity20 nuclear power plant in @entity22 prefecture , more than four years after the @entity23
prime minister @entity25 's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many @entity4 , who view nuclear energy as too dangerous
a staff member spotted the drone wednesday morning on the roof of @entity25 's residence , @entity29 said
dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone , which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters ( 20 inches ) wide
police say the drone was equipped with a small camera , smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium , a common byproduct of nuclear reactors
cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed @entity52 nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown
investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle
the amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans
chief cabinet secretary @entity58 said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism
" there might be terrorism attempts in the future at the @entity65 and @entity66 using drones , " @entity58 said
" so we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones
the government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism
" @entity4 law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft , but there are no flight restrictions for most of @entity0 , including the prime minister 's residence and local and federal government buildings
@entity25 was not in his office at the time
he is in @entity88 , attending the @entity89
@entity1 's @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 contributed to this report .
