@entity1 , @entity2 freshly laundered clothes still hang friday in the dormitory at @entity5
stuffed animals remain in one room
on the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for @entity12 prayer
these small reminders of college life at this @entity2 school belie the horror of what happened here : the slaughter of at least 147 people , many of them students who lived in this building
on friday afternoon , more than 36 hours after the attack , investigators and @entity2 @entity26 crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students
the corpses of four @entity32 attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their ak - 47s -- remained where they fell , their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets
@entity2 terrorist attack : 6 things you need to know investigators marked the locations of students ' bodies with numbered tags before @entity26 workers came in to send them off to morgues
they would call out to each other with the locations of the dead , reducing once promising lives , for the time being at least , to numbers
sometimes , the cell phones of the dead would ring , taking the workers aback
beyond the bodies , evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere
shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor
walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes
in some places , the blood was as thick as mud
the problems plaguing @entity2 's security efforts according to students and authorities , militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. thursday
the gunmen , from the @entity32 terror group , first stormed a @entity80 prayer service , killing some students , taking others hostage
they rampaged across the campus , shooting non-muslims , sparing @entity85 , a witness said
one student , @entity87 , told @entity3 she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her
come out , they told her , you wo n't be shot
" they were lying , " she said
the gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they 'd usually hang out and watch television
they were told to lie down , lectured about how the @entity95 forbids killing women
and then the men , @entity98 said , were shot in the head
one of the gunmen egged on the others
" shoot them ! shoot them ! " he would say , according to @entity98
more lecturing : the land , the gunmen said , did n't belong to nonbelievers
we , the gunmen said , have just two missions : to kill , and be killed
and then they started shooting the women
" anyone who is breathing , shoot them , " @entity98 said the gunman in charge said
" we just lay there hopelessly , because we know automatically we 're going to be killed , " @entity98 said
it was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor
she smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she , too , was dead
" in the time of shooting , they skipped me , " she said
she survived with only a hand wound
many of the other students were shot in the back of the head , a medic told @entity3
others had been beheaded , according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in @entity139
even longtime relief workers such as @entity141 with the @entity142 said they were shocked at what they saw
" i have seen many things , " @entity141 told @entity144 , " but nothing like that
