@entity0 , @entity1 the cracker or the bite of ice cream -- @entity6 still is n't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day
her food allergies change so frequently , keeping track is almost pointless
it was just another day with another massive allergic reaction
she can always tell when one is coming on
" i just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom
" her labradoodle , @entity19 , starts alerting , licking her hands frantically
" i 'll feel like i 'm being stabbed in the stomach , and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling
and we have to treat it really fast
" on that particular day in march , multiple epipens did n't slow the reaction
the paramedics who arrived to take @entity6 to @entity31 , or " @entity32 " as she likes to call it , knew her well
when she asked for her security blanket , they knew to hand her her smartphone
" new day , new crisis , " @entity6 quips as she tells the story , as if it 's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong
it might as well be
when you 're allergic to life , a near - death experience is no big deal
less than a week after her trip to the hospital , @entity6 , 21 , is back at home in @entity0 , @entity1
she lies on her back , her head near the foot of her bed , chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port
@entity56 , a paralegal by day , dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that 's connected to @entity6 's jugular vein
the disinfectant burns , and @entity6 's blood pressure hits 150/102
her heart rate rockets to 128
" the meds we have to give her to keep her alive , she reacts to , " @entity56 says , shaking her head
" never in a million years did i think i would be doing this
" @entity6 was seemingly a normal kid -- until she was n't
yes , she was a fussy baby
yes , she got sick often as a child , @entity56 muses out loud -- but what kid does n't ? @entity6 was also incredibly energetic , always the center of attention
her father , @entity73 , jokingly rues the day she learned to talk
she started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11
that was the same year doctors diagnosed @entity6 with @entity80 , or irritable bowel syndrome
" she 's always been -- " @entity56 pauses
" high maintenance ! " @entity6 fills in with a laugh
it was n't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that @entity6 had her first serious allergic reaction
the next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors ' appointments
@entity6 saw specialist after specialist
the gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis , or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles
a cardiologist said she had @entity97 , or @entity97 -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes , her blood pressure dropped , leaving her light - headed and nauseated
a @entity100 doctor diagnosed her with @entity101 , a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints
after doing hours of research , @entity56 , @entity73 and @entity6 came up with their own diagnosis : mast cell disease
they found a specialist online , dr. @entity110 , who at the time was working in @entity113
they waited nearly nine months to see him , but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life - changing
scientists do n't know yet what causes mast cell disease
researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior , but the mutations vary from one patient to the next
because of this , scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life
but genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations
mast cells are the regulators of your immune system
they 're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites , or when you come into contact with an allergen
they basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong
until recently , the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis , which is characterized by " abnormal proliferation and activation " of the body 's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways
but in the last few years doctors such as @entity110 have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease
for instance , @entity6 has mast cell activation syndrome , meaning her mast cells act strangely , but they 're not growing in number
" it 's like i 'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction , " @entity6 explains simply
fruit , vegetables , milk , soy , nuts , smoke , perfume , the sun -- you name it , @entity6 is allergic to it
but it 's not really about the specifics ; the allergens change depending on how " angry " her mast cells are that day , she says
on good days , she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes
on bad days , even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain
not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as @entity6 does
" oh @entity190 , no , " @entity110 says when asked
" no , no , no , no. " but mast cells are located in your connective tissue , including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine
they can affect every system in the body , @entity110 says , so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms @entity6 experiences
you have to ask yourself , he says : " is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different , independent problems ? or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on ? " of course , having a diagnosis did n't make living with mast cell disease any easier
in 2012 , @entity6 was admitted to the hospital 30 times
she started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful , violent muscle contractions that are " scary to see and scary to experience
" on multiple occasions , doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction .
