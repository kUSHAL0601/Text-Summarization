feeling so happy you just ca n't stand it ? you might want to pop some acetaminophen
a new study has found that acetaminophen , the main ingredient in @entity10 , most forms of @entity6 and more than 600 other medicines , reduces not only pain but pleasure , as well
the authors of the study , which was published this week in @entity14 , say that it was already known that acetaminophen blunted psychological pain
but their new research led them to the conclusion that it also blunted joy -- in other words , that it narrowed the range of feelings experienced
" this means that using @entity10 or similar products might have broader consequences than previously thought , " said @entity24 , a doctoral student in social psychology at @entity26 and the lead author of the study
" rather than just being a pain reliever , acetaminophen can be seen as an all - purpose emotion reliever
" the researchers tested their thesis by showing 82 college students 40 photographs -- some of highly pleasant images , such as children with kittens , and some of highly unpleasant images , such as children who were malnourished
half of the participants in the study were given " an acute dose " of acetaminophen -- 1,000 milligrams -- and the other half were given a placebo with the same appearance
the subjects were then asked to rate the photos according to how unpleasant or pleasant they were
those who took the acetaminophen rated all the photos less extremely than those who took the placebo
" in other words , positive photos were not seen as positively under the influence of acetaminophen and negative photos were not seen as negatively , " the authors reported
the researchers followed up by testing a group of 85 people to see whether this change in judgment applied just to emotions or whether the drug blunted people 's evaluation of magnitude in general
this group showed the same blunting of emotional reactions
but acetaminophen did not affect how much blue they saw in each photo
but people who participated in the study did not appear to know they were acting differently , said @entity81 , an assistant professor of psychology who was another of the study 's authors
" most people probably are n't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen , " @entity81 said
each week , about 23 % of @entity89 adults -- or 52 million people -- use a medicine containing acetaminophen , according to the nonprofit @entity93
the authors said it was not known whether other pain relievers , such as ibuprofen and aspirin , have the same effect
but have no fear -- they plan to study that question , as well .
