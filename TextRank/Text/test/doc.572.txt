the much - discussed trailer for " @entity3 v. @entity2 : @entity5 " just got a makeover
soon after the trailer went up late on friday , youtuber @entity6 got to work on doing his own version using classic superhero footage
instead of @entity12 and @entity13 facing off , this version wonders what it would be like if comics ' classic characters @entity18 and @entity19 took their places
@entity0 spoke to 18 - year - old @entity6 about what motivated him to make his now - viral video
( @entity23 , the studio behind " @entity3 v. @entity2 , " is owned by @entity24 , as is @entity0
) @entity0 : when did you start making @entity27 videos like this ? @entity6 : at age 11
i work for the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33
@entity0 : where did this idea come from ? @entity6 : i 'm pretty hyped for " @entity3 v. @entity2
" as soon as i saw the trailer , my brain immediately went to the classic " @entity3 " [ tv series ] and i thought how funny it would be if this film was made at the time
@entity0 : what were you looking to accomplish ? @entity6 : i wanted to contrast the old with the new
@entity0 : what kind of reaction have you received ? @entity6 : within an hour of the trailer going up , i went to work on the edit
within four hours , my edit was finished and up on the @entity51
the reaction has been great ! it 's awesome to see so many people enjoying what i made
take a look at the fan trailer below :
