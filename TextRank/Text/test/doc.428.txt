they may not be " @entity7 " - type extraterrestrials , but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life , a @entity1 scientist says
" i think we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity14 within a decade , and i think we 're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years , " @entity1 chief scientist @entity9 said tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe
" we know where to look
we know how to look , " she said
" in most cases , we have the technology , and we 're on a path to implementing it
and so i think we 're definitely on the road
" @entity1 released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies , including the dwarf planet @entity30 and @entity32 's @entity31
the @entity33 has been key to the discoveries , @entity1 said in a news release
" scientists using @entity1 's @entity33 recently provided powerful evidence that ( @entity32 's moon ) @entity39 has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice , " the agency noted
there are some caveats involved , of course
@entity1 is n't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the @entity49 ; it 's referring to microorganisms
" we are not talking about little green men , " @entity9 said at the panel
" we are talking about little microbes
" still , former astronaut @entity54 said it 's an exciting time -- and he thinks it 's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well
" i think we 're one generation away in our solar system , whether it 's on an icy moon or on @entity65 , and one generation on a planet around a nearby star , " he said
and , he added , who knows what that life will look like ? " once we get out beyond @entity65 , the likelihood that it 's similar to @entity14 because we share that material gets very , very low , " he said
" and i think that 's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting
