the @entity0 can rest more comfortably living in @entity2 now that their 5 - year - old daughter can get the marijuana extract she needs
" this means the world to us , " said @entity6 's mother , @entity5
gov. @entity10 signed a bill thursday that will legalize low - @entity13 cannabis oil for certain " medication - resistant epilepsies , " while creating an infrastructure , registration process and research program for the drug
( @entity13 is the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana
) the bill is dubbed @entity6 's @entity22
@entity6 , who has been the face of the bill , was having hundreds of seizures a day and the five potent drugs meant to control them were n't making life better for the little girl
@entity5 said in a march 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to @entity33 , where medical marijuana is legal , in hopes of saving her life
" she was maxed out , " @entity5 said
" she 'd quit breathing several times a day , and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications
" 10 diseases marijuana could affect @entity5 had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help , but it was n't available in @entity2
so a week after hearing a doctor 's diagnosis that @entity6 might not live another three months , she and @entity6 packed up and moved to @entity48 , @entity33
there , @entity6 began a regimen of cannabis oil : four times a day and once at night
" every time she smiled i knew we did the right thing , because we had n't seen her smile in three years , " @entity5 said
" now she 's thriving , she 's healthy , she 's happy , and they 're absolutely shocked at the difference
so i think we 've turned some nonbelievers into believers of cannabis oil
" deal is apparently one of those believers , signing @entity65 on thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions
the bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders , but it also will allow patients to receive in - state treatment
to obtain a license in @entity2 , you will need to have a specific covered condition , such as acute seizures
" for the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain , the wait is finally over , " @entity10 said thursday
" ... now , @entity2 children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much - needed care
" for @entity5 , it 's a blessing " to be able to come back home , and with @entity6 's medicine , it 's done wonders for her -- going from 200 - plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling , happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she 's in there
" she added , " @entity33 has been good to us , but @entity2 's home
" with medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states , doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments
while @entity2 's law is specific to a handful of conditions , medical marijuana laws in states such as @entity112 permit marijuana use for an array of ailments
but as states rewrite their regulations , federal law remains the same : marijuana is illegal to grow , sell or use for any purpose
under the @entity120 , marijuana is listed on @entity120 , meaning it has " no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse
" to backers of reform , it presents a @entity128 : marijuana is restricted , in large part , because there is scant research to support medical uses , yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions .
