most climbers who try do n't succeed in summiting the 29,035 - foot - high @entity2 , the world 's tallest peak
but they do leave their trash
thousands of pounds of it
that 's why an experienced climbing group from the @entity10 army plans to trek up the 8,850 - meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms ( more than 8,000 pounds ) of waste from the high - altitude camps , according to @entity14
the mountain is part of the @entity17 mountain range on the border between @entity19 and the @entity21 region
the 34 - member team plans to depart for @entity23 on saturday and start the ascent in mid-may
the upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first @entity10 team to scale @entity2
" sadly , @entity2 is now ... called the world 's highest junkyard , " maj. @entity28 , the team leader , told @entity14
" we will target the mountaineering waste from @entity33 ( 19,695 feet ) to the summit , " said @entity28 , who has scaled @entity2 twice
" there are old cylinders , tents , tins , packets , equipment and other mountaineering waste
apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each , we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip
" more than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak , part of a @entity47
the @entity10 expedition is n't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers
among the cleanup efforts is the @entity54 , an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing " in an eco-sensitive manner , " bringing old refuse , in addition to that generated during the trip , down for disposal , according to the @entity64 website
last year , @entity19 tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage , in addition to their own trash and human waste , according to the @entity71 .
