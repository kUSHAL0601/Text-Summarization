this is week two of an ongoing series : a @entity2 this week covers the @entity3 , chapters 1 - 11
a week ago , i was worried i would n't have anything to write about
now , i do n't even know where to begin
the first step was choosing a @entity9
i went with the version that i received for winning the religion award at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14
as i mentioned in the first installment of this series , i 'm a lifelong @entity2 who finally plans to read the @entity9 from cover to cover
the @entity9 i 'm reading is " @entity19 , " published in 1986 by @entity20
after four days of reading this week , my journal is full of observations and ideas
with my crazy schedule , i found that reading at night was a perfect way to unwind and reflect
and as i started reading , i did n't want to stop
in order to fully process @entity28 , i need to slow down and read the footnotes
first of all , @entity3 starts with two separate creation narratives
how did i not know this ? the first chapter is the seven days story with @entity36 creating the @entity37
in the second chapter the @entity37 is again created and man is formed out of clay
talking with a @entity0 colleague , i mentioned how there seems to be fascination in @entity3 with dirt and clay
my colleague pointed out that even @entity47 's name is a play on the @entity50 word " adama , " meaning ground
it struck me that the whole first two chapters have everything to do with the @entity37 and man 's place in it , a struggle that we can relate to even now
from the creation of the @entity63 to the fall and the banishment , the bounty of the land and the access to it seems to be the area of highest concern
my greatest surprise , though , came when i read about @entity69
@entity69 ? who ? i started asking people if they had remembered the story of @entity69
my unscientific poll of friends is that 9 out 10 people i asked had no idea who he was
turns out , @entity69 is the forgotten son of @entity47 who is born after @entity79 kills @entity79
@entity47 fathered @entity69 at 130 years old
yes , we are getting into the part of the @entity9 with fantastical life spans that allow for the transition from the stories of @entity47 to @entity85
( again , thank you footnotes )
unfortunately , we do n't learn much more about @entity69
when he is mentioned , it 's about his descendants
but , because this was my first biblical surprise , i will never forget him
as a woman , though i was waiting to read more about the role of women
did you know that @entity97 is the first person named in the @entity9 ? ( i expected @entity47 , but he is called " man " in the first references
) moving on , we have these tales about the " sons of heaven " seeing @entity37 's beautiful women and taking them as wives
um ? what ? i had never heard that one before
i had to read that passage a few times and , again , the footnotes helped
they say the story is an inclusion from mythology
but why ? my first hunch is that it might have been a way to take a story that everyone knew at the time and make it part of a new narrative
familiarity would lead to followers
of course , many @entity124 do n't cite the " sons of heaven " today because it would take too much time to explain
maybe that 's why i do n't ever recall hearing this passage read at @entity131 with that in mind , i read about @entity134 , descendent of @entity69 , with a different perspective , too
i have never believed there was an ark. i never thought that @entity36 dictated the dimensions of the boat to save the animals two by two
it is a story told to make you realize the power of @entity36
the explanation for the flood is that man had become more and more wicked , but i did n't expect , though , that @entity36 would " regret " creating man
ouch ! it really makes the reader want to stay on @entity36 's good side
this " wickedness " of mankind and the " regret " from @entity36 sounds as if @entity36 made a mistake and decides to fix it , to start over , in essence
" never again will i doom the @entity37 because of man , since the desires of man are evil from the start
... " that phrase reminded me of my dad 's favorite saying , " to err is human but to forgive is divine , " which comes from a @entity165 , but not a @entity2 holy man
but enough about that , i have to get back to reading .
