there 's an old saying which states the @entity3 are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world
in truth , such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove
but there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend : the important and proud relationship the @entity17 island country of just 500,000 people has with music
situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of @entity21 , @entity3 has long been a mesh of cultures , history and races
the former @entity27 territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade , a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled @entity33
from this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque , morna , funana and other distinct musical styles
now , @entity3 is seeking to tap - into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish
bereft of oil , gas , gold , diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other @entity50 countries , @entity3 has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development
and what 's more alternative than a jiving , swinging , musical economy ? " besides fish , it is pretty common ( for @entity3 ) to say ' our biggest richness is in music and culture , ' " said @entity57 of @entity58 , an international networking platform for the world music genre
the economic potential of music has been also acknowledged by @entity3 's prime minister , @entity69 , while the country 's ministry of culture is run by @entity72 , himself a popular musician
" the future of our country lies in our capacity to create , our capacity to innovate , " @entity69 said in reference to the music and the arts at a @entity78 conference in 2013
other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts , fashion and visual arts to name but a few
however , a 2013 report from the @entity91 noted that @entity3 's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning
but that does n't mean there has n't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future
one early musical success has been the @entity106
the event , which is celebrating its seventh edition , took place in the capital city of @entity111 this past weekend
artists including @entity115 - winning @entity114 singer @entity113 have been invited to perform , as have acts from the likes of @entity118 , @entity119 and , of course , @entity3
according to @entity123 , a liaison to the mayor of @entity111 involved with promoting the festival , " @entity106 has become one of the most spectacular events in @entity3
" we breathe the music in @entity3 , we live with the music , " he added
" now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world ( to share in this )
" during the festival , bars , hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as " the week of party
" it 's a lucrative trade , for sure
yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country 's ministry of culture , alongside some enterprising private sector figures , thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required
enter the @entity153 , a three - year - old conference and networking event that seeks to help @entity3 artists secure international exposure
this year 's ame took place in the days before the @entity106
delegates , local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables , workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business
" we try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from @entity3 , " said @entity167 , long time manager of the @entity169 songstress @entity168
@entity167 is one of the driving forces behind @entity153 as well as being the founder of the @entity180 and @entity181 record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from @entity3
he hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top - level musicians , they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of @entity3 across the globe
not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians ( with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require ) but it will garner valuable attention for the country
this is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie
tourism is expected to account for 20 % of the country 's gdp by 2024 , according to research from the @entity209
getting @entity3 's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important
" economically it 's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big , " @entity167 said
" this way it costs less money
" @entity57 agrees with this , and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like @entity167 for special praise
" in the long term , the whole country is behind this event , " @entity57 said , adding " this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries
" it must be noted , however , that few countries have the same natural resources for music as @entity3
