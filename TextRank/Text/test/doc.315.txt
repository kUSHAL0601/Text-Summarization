i was a copygirl in my fourth month at the @entity2 , my second assigned to the city desk
it had become my custom at 4 o'clock , when the city desk secretary left for the day , to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day
it was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago , on thursday , april 12 , 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks
the second city editor , @entity16 , was to my left
to my right , perhaps 6 feet away , the telegraph editor , @entity19
at 4:50 , the old - fashioned upright " candlestick " telephone on his desk rang -- the direct line @entity25 used to alert editors to major news events
he answered , replaced the bell - like receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular , " @entity34 is dead
" the silence of shock
until @entity39 jumped up so quickly , his swivel chair crashed into the glass - fronted bookcase behind him -- a symphonic orchestra cymbals sound -- and ran to what was called the @entity43 , with its row of @entity25 teletype machines
@entity16 said , " clear the decks for action
" the words had barely cleared his lips when city editor @entity50 half - ran back into the city room
@entity52 , director of the @entity53 , was only a step or two behind
the door of the managing editor 's office that opened into the city room flew open , and managing editor @entity59 joined them around the copy desk , where @entity39 was editing the bulletin
@entity50 wheeled toward the rewrite desk
" @entity64 ! get downstairs
" the main entrance to the @entity2 building also served as the main entrance to the @entity70 terminal , with its commuter trains to the @entity73 communities
a veritable sea of lemmings would be coming up that marble incline for the next hour
not that @entity77 could linger
the @entity2 , an afternoon newspaper , was strictly limited in the hours it could publish
only an hour or so remained for @entity78
i knew clips would be needed and ran to the library , the old " morgue
" they 'd heard and had a splay of white envelopes on president @entity86 -- big and bulging -- spread out
they had one , as i recall -- a small one -- on @entity88
i grabbed it and ran back down the corridor
@entity91 , who usually handled labor stories , had been told " to do something on the new president
" he opened the @entity88 envelope , spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the " books " in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen : five sheets of copy paper stapled together , with four sheets of carbon paper between
to be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies : the top one for the editor , a carbon copy for the reporter 's reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks @entity91 's eyes moved over the clippings , evaluating , rejecting , selecting , deciding what to use
at last , he started typing
because of the time pressure , the story would be done in " short takes " : two , maybe three paragraphs at a time
he wrote : " the new president -- the 33d in the history of the @entity126 -- is @entity88
" he was automatically elevated to the presidency on the death of president @entity86
" @entity88 will be 61 on may 8
" @entity91 ripped the book out of the typewriter roller
i left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to @entity50
back by @entity91 , i read over his shoulder : " born in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity88 's political rise was spectacular
" he was relatively little known outside of his home state when he was elected to the @entity141 in 1934
he had the backing of the @entity143 " @entity144 , of the @entity146 machine
this time , @entity91 gave me a nod
i pulled out the book , the typewriter roller ratcheting protest
after two more takes , @entity50 said , " okay , that 's it
the cricket - like click click click of typewriter keys at the rewrite desk drew me , and i stood by to take his story to @entity50 : " word of president @entity86 's death struck @entity162 late this afternoon with numbing suddenness
" within a few minutes after the bulletins came to @entity166 , the office switchboards were swamped with calls for verification
" so great were the number of calls , that the lines became clogged and many queries could not be handled
" many of the callers spoke as if disbelieving the report -- as if it were some wildly spread rumor
" the same kind of uncertainty was noticed in the faces of the crowds thronging homeward
@entity159 passed from one to another : " ' did you hear that ? @entity86 is dead ? is it true ' ? " @entity64 's story delivered , i returned to the city desk to help with the calls
many , as he had mentioned , from people wanting to know whether it was true but some from reporters and beat men who 'd been heading home , reporting the reaction where they were
a copyboy rushed around the room , dropping off copies of the first extra -- the simple news in a 76 - point - type headline : roosevelt dead statements began coming in from local officials and civic leaders , a few phoned in but most from the @entity206 , which served the @entity162 newspapers with local news as the wire services did with national news
i sorted through the multiple copies , separating them into ever - growing stacks
the second extra was dropped off
roosevelt dead with the subhead : dies at 63 of @entity217 in @entity218 the last extra had a three - column photo of @entity86 , edged in black , a two - column of @entity88 and a story on the president 's death and funeral plans
as the editors talked , i heard one ask , " what kind of president do you think he 'll make ? " and @entity52 , director of the @entity53 , said , " if there 's anything to the @entity126 system , the man will rise to the office
" i 've thought of that through the years as @entity88 has risen in the opinion of presidential historians
recognition of the state of @entity244
desegregation of the armed services
ordering @entity126 forces to oppose the invading forces when @entity249 crossed the @entity250 and invaded @entity251 , then organizing a @entity253 army
i continued to sort the statements from officials
@entity50 asked me to take one set down to @entity259
the chief editorial writer had a corner office at the far end of the long office corridor
i found him sitting in the dark , looking out the window at the @entity162 skyline
sensing my presence , he said , " i wonder what the world will be like without him
" " i do n't know , sir
" in the dusk , the quiet , i suspect he did n't expect an answer , but i thought about @entity86 , who served in the @entity275 for an unprecedented 12 years
" he 's the only president i can remember
" he turned , saw me in the doorway , a teenager in penny loafers , a cardigan sweater and a pleated plaid skirt , and said with a nod , " of course
" i gave him the statements and updated him on the latest news
" the funeral train will bring his body up from @entity218 ... to @entity287 , i mean
" the next morning , i turned to the editorial page to see what he 'd written
@entity259 took his cue from @entity86 's address to a joint session of the @entity294 following his trip to @entity296
the headline : " it has been a long journey
i trust you will agree it has been a fruitful one
" note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted @entity86 's age in the @entity2 subhead
