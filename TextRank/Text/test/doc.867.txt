it 's been a busy few weeks for multiples
the first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in @entity6 on april 8 , and the parents are blogging about their unique experience
@entity9 delivered all five girls at the @entity11 via c - section at 28 weeks and two days , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity13
@entity14 and @entity15 and big sister @entity16 are now a family of eight
the babies are named @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22
" we are so thankful and blessed , " said @entity9 , who had intrauterine insemination to get pregnant

i am so thankful for this wonderful hospital and team of people here
they truly all are amazing
" you can learn all about their journey at their blog , " it 's a @entity36
" early news reports said the @entity9 girls were the first all - female quintuplets born in the @entity39 but a user alerted @entity1 to news clippings that show quintuplet girls were born in 1959 to @entity43 and @entity44 in @entity45
all of the girls died within 24 hours
like the @entity9 family , @entity47 and @entity48 were hoping for a second child
when they found out what they were having , they decided to keep it a secret from family and friends
that 's why they did n't tell their family the gender of baby no. 2 -- or that @entity47 was actually expecting not one but two girls , according to @entity1 affiliate wear
and when everyone arrived at @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 , after @entity47 gave birth march 11 , they recorded everyone 's reactions to meeting twins @entity74 and @entity76
the video was uploaded to @entity78 on saturday and has been viewed more than 700,000 times
