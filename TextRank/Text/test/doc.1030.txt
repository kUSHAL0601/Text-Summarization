as thousands of @entity2 took to the streets of the city of @entity5 to rally against violence and xenophobia , an online community has joined the protests
the marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives
during the protest march thursday , @entity15 followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns
@entity20 and # @entity19 were some of the most popular
@entity22 said more than 10,000 people attended the march , including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations
hashtags are now pouring out of @entity2
but many are asking , some via @entity15 , is it enough to fight # xenophobia ? attacks this week in @entity5 alone have killed two immigrants and three @entity2 , including a 14 - year - old boy , authorities said
for @entity2 @entity36 , tweeting was n't going to make a bit of difference
@entity36 , who lives in @entity39 , has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against @entity43 , who he said referred to foreigners as " lice " and has said " they should pack their bags and go
" " people listen to him , " @entity36 said
" he is a monarch
the @entity43 people in @entity2 take him very seriously , they do n't question what he says
" @entity36 said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they were n't enough
so he filed a complaint with the @entity59 , and then tweeted about it
" the activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times , " @entity36 said
" i want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it wo n't cost them anything , but i will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being
" now , the @entity59 must decide whether to investigate @entity36 's allegations against the @entity72 , who denies fueling any violence
@entity36 hopes others will also make complaints
@entity36 added that @entity76 are n't the only people in @entity2 who share in the xenophobic sentiment
" people are frustrated and unemployed , and people in @entity2 pay foreign nationals a lot less , " he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants
" a domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house , whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand , so it causes resentment
" @entity91 , founder and chairman of the @entity94 in @entity5 , does n't think most @entity2 are against foreigners
" @entity2 are against xenophobia , " said @entity96 , who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals
gift of @entity104 has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the @entity2 government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees , he said , passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs
the organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with # xenophobia
why ? " in @entity2 , everyone knows xenophobia , " @entity96 said , " and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand
so if you say # tsunami or # war , people follow it
so here , people say # xenophobia , and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster , so you are going to post what people understand
" he said @entity2 also have been going to the camps , which are on sports fields with makeshift tents , bringing cooked food and other necessities
" this is different from what happened in 2008 , " @entity96 said
that year , scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of @entity145
most of the victims were @entity148 who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances
@entity96 said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence , community engagement is happening now as it never happened before
it is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story : # @entity158
only time , or , tweets will tell if it works .
