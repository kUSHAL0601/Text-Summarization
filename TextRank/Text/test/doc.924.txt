five young men were arrested saturday in @entity2 , @entity3 , in what police called a major counterterrorism operation
three of the teens , all of them either 18 or 19 , have since been released " pending further enquiries , " @entity3 's @entity7 said , but two remain in custody
@entity13 , 18 , has been charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act , and was denied bail saturday
the other suspect , a 19 - year - old , has not yet appeared in court
" some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was @entity27 - inspired , " said @entity19 , acting deputy commissioner of the @entity20
the suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week , prime minister @entity28 said saturday
" the act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers , " he said
there was also a risk to the public , police said
police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on @entity42 ( @entity3 and @entity43 ) , which is april 25 and this year is the centennial of the @entity45 in @entity46 @entity28 avoided the term @entity27 -- or @entity47 -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects
he instead referred to the group as the " @entity52 death cult , " employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group 's name in @entity56
it 's a handle @entity27 is known to loathe
@entity7 also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection
the men " are individuals acting by themselves
they are not representatives of any religious , cultural or national group , " @entity63 acting deputy commissioner @entity62 said
" i think the entire @entity3 community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men , " @entity19 said
" and this is an issue not just with law enforcement , but for the broader community
... we need to get better in relation to identifying young men and woman involved in this type of behavior , at the very early stage
" the suspects were associates of 18 - year - old @entity81 , who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in september , police said
@entity28 lamented a string of extremist attacks on @entity3 soil
in december , @entity3 authorities stormed a @entity89 chocolate cafe where a self - styled @entity91 cleric had been holding hostages , killing the gunman
two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died
in february , two men were charged with plotting terror activities in @entity89
despite distancing the suspects from religion , @entity28 did make a connection to the @entity102
" there are now about a hundred @entity3 who are fighting with terrorists in the @entity102 , " and another 150 people in @entity3 support them with funds and recruiting , the prime minister said
in february , @entity28 announced tougher citizenship laws as a part of the government 's new counterterrorism strategy
authorities have suspended @entity3 passports of those they suspect of terrorist activity
@entity3 should be stoic about the threat of terrorism , @entity28 said saturday
" the best thing you can do in the face of those who would do us harm is live your life normally
" he asked @entity3 to turn out in droves on @entity42
police said this particular threat had been fully contained .
