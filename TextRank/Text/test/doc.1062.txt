@entity0 , @entity1 government officials are trying to track down vacationers who stayed at villas in the @entity6 who may have been exposed to a deadly pesticide
local officials said methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the @entity1 , in different parts of the island ; even the governor said his condominium complex was fumigated with it in 2013 , without his knowledge
investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at the @entity21 resort , where a @entity24 family 's vacation in paradise turned into a nightmare
@entity27 and @entity28 and their two children fell gravely ill and suffered seizures ; two brothers , ages 14 and 16 , remain in comas
but this was likely not an isolated incident
local authorities here tell @entity2 there is evidence methyl bromide was used at least twice at the gated @entity21 resort on @entity0 by the pest control company @entity41
they also say @entity41 used the pesticide across the islands on different occasions
@entity46 , the commissioner designee of the local @entity47 , or @entity48 , said that while investigating what happened , the agency found methyl bromide was likely also used last fall at the same @entity21 resort , as well as in a vacation villa in @entity54 and in two nontourist locations
methyl bromide is banned from indoor use , and is only approved as an agricultural pesticide
other pest control companies on the @entity6 were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly
@entity65 , the governor of the @entity6 , said it was
" what these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law and they 'll be held accountable for it , " @entity65 said
he said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013 , but said there have been no additional reports of people falling ill. authorities are trying to track down anyone who has stayed at the affected villas or who might have been exposed
@entity81 slowly recovering from illness after @entity1 trip @entity41 issued a statement saying it is " committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers , employees , the public and the environment " and is " looking into this matter internally , and cooperating with authorities
" when @entity2 visited the @entity41 office on @entity94 , which is corporate - owned , an employee refused to comment , and another employee closed the door
@entity97 said all canisters of methyl bromide known to exist in the area have been confiscated and will be shipped off - island for destruction as soon as possible
in the meantime , an attorney for @entity28 and @entity27 said the family is still struggling
the two teenage boys remain in comas
their father has regained consciousness and is slowly getting better
@entity27 is in better condition and is undergoing occupational therapy
@entity48 , the local environmental agency , already had been under scrutiny
the @entity113 , which has oversight , designated it " high risk , " saying the agency " does not meet management standards
" the @entity113 's inspector general is also investigating
according to the @entity120 , a former commissioner and two @entity48 directors have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008
that year , @entity124 was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts
in 2014 , @entity127 , the @entity120 said , pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of that same agency
he was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison
in january , @entity65 was sworn in and appointed @entity97 as a new designee to run the department , so it is under a new administration
a spokeswoman for the @entity113 said the @entity48 has been cooperative in this investigation
she added that none of the troubles the agency has had are directly related to pesticide enforcement , but instead general practices
@entity65 said the agency 's problems have nothing to do with what happened to the @entity27 and @entity28 's family
instead , he blames the pesticide companies
" it occurred because someone was cutting corners , thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it , and apparently in my own residence someone had been getting away with it for quite some time , " @entity65 said
part of the investigation , he said , will be tracking whether the proper paperwork was filled out when the canisters were ordered , or if the pesticide was smuggled in
the @entity120 is also investigating
" if they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes , which is the only legal way they could use it , and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings , that 's a clear and malice violation of the law , " @entity65 said .
