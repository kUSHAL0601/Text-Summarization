@entity1 's stellar career has included a @entity3
last week , she made it into outer space
a @entity7 astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from @entity10 , who was gravely wounded by a @entity10 @entity13 gunman for promoting the right of girls ' to go to school
it took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago
but @entity1 recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause
after reading her story , scientist @entity24 , who also consults for @entity26 on a children 's educational science show , decided @entity1 deserved to be immortalized
so , she attached her name to the heavens
thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between @entity33 and @entity34
@entity24 , working at the @entity35 , discovered @entity36 in june 2010 , which gave her the right to name it
" my postdoctoral fellow dr. @entity41 brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named , very few have been named to honor the contributions of women ( and particularly women of color ) , " @entity24 wrote in a note to @entity40
@entity24 gave it the name @entity40 , or 2010 ml48
@entity1 's asteroid circles the sun between @entity33 and @entity34 every five and half years , @entity24 said
" it is about 4 kilometers in diameter , and its surface is very dark , the color of printer toner
" as a scientist , her support for @entity1 's work is logical
when girls around the world also get educations , it increases human potential
" we desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity 's most difficult problems , and we ca n't afford to reject half the population 's , " @entity24 wrote .
