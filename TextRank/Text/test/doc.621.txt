seventy years ago , @entity0 died of typhus in a @entity4 concentration camp at the age of 15
just two weeks after her supposed death on march 31 , 1945 , the @entity6 where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the @entity10 diarist had been to surviving the @entity11
but new research released by the @entity13 shows that @entity0 and her older sister , @entity14 , died at least a month earlier than previously thought
researchers re-examined archives of the @entity17 , the @entity18 and the @entity6 , along with testimonies of survivors
they concluded that @entity0 and @entity14 probably did not survive to march 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by @entity24 authorities
in 1944 , @entity0 and seven others hiding in the @entity27 secret annex were arrested and sent to the @entity29 concentration camp
@entity0 's final entry that same year , @entity0 and @entity14 were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the @entity6 camp in @entity35
days at the camp were filled with terror and dread , witnesses said
the sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting , little water and no latrine
they slept on lice - ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents , according to the researchers
like the other prisoners , the sisters endured long hours at roll call
her classmate , @entity57 , recalled seeing @entity0 there in december 1944 : " she was no more than a skeleton by then
she was wrapped in a blanket ; she could n't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice
" listen to @entity0 's friends describe her concentration camp experience as the @entity67 advanced further , the @entity6 became even more crowded , bringing more disease
a deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day
typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene
the disease causes high fever , chills and skin eruptions
" because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes , @entity0 was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period , " museum researchers wrote
they concluded that it 's unlikely the sisters survived until march , because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before february 7
" most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear , " wrote authors @entity93 and @entity95
the exact dates of death for @entity0 and @entity14 remain unclear
" @entity0 never gave up hope , " said @entity101 , her friend
" she was absolutely convinced she would survive
" her diary endures as one of the world 's most popular books
