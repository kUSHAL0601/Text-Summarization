a high temperature of 63.5 degrees fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you 're in @entity4
the chilly continent recorded the temperature ( 15.5 degrees @entity7 ) on march 24 , possibly the highest ever recorded on @entity4 , according to the @entity8
the temperature was recorded at @entity11 's @entity10 on the northern tip of the @entity13 , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity14
( note to map lovers : the @entity11 base is not geographically part of the @entity19 continent
) the @entity20 , a specialized @entity21 agency , is in the process of setting up an international ad - hoc committee of about 10 blue - ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence , said @entity27 , the agency 's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and @entity33 professor of geographical sciences
the committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature , whether it was in good working order , whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed , whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations , @entity27 said
the committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to @entity27 , who will make an official finding , probably by late summer or early fall
researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the @entity4 region and elsewhere for evidence that the @entity54 is getting warmer .
