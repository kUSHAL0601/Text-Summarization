@entity0 in a movie ? what a silly idea
but the timing was right for the gang of @entity7 comedians ( along with their token @entity8 , @entity9 ) , who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of " @entity13 , " their groundbreaking @entity7 tv series
" @entity0 and the @entity16 , " which premiered 40 years ago thursday , was the result
the movie , a spoof of the @entity20 legend , did not start auspiciously
the budget was small -- about $ 400,000 , half of it supplied by rock stars , including @entity25 and @entity26
on the first day of filming in @entity30 -- the first shot , in fact -- the camera broke
python member @entity34 was suffering from alcohol withdrawal
on the day of its first @entity8 screening in @entity39 , a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. thanks to the popularity of " @entity0 " on @entity8 tv , the movie was a box - office hit , making $ 5 million -- more than 10 times its budget
more importantly , it soon became a comedy classic
the dialogue alone has been widely quoted , with such lines as " it 's just a flesh wound " and " your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries " referenced on shows such as " @entity56 , " " @entity57 " and " @entity58
" @entity0 member @entity59 turned the film into the @entity62 - winning @entity61 play " @entity63
" the troupe ended up making three movies -- well , four , if you count " @entity69 , " five if you include " @entity68 , " five - and - a - half if you allow " @entity67 , " six if you ... well , three
is there a best one ? where should you start ? let 's break them down : from its dramatic opening credits featuring fake - @entity79 subtitles to the adventures of sir @entity81 ( " the boldest and most expensive of the knights " ) , weighted - bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks , " @entity16 " is probably the loosest and most @entity0 of the @entity0 oeuvre
as a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense , it falls short -- but as a repository for some of @entity0 's best gags , it remains perhaps the best ( and certainly most quotable ) of the bunch
besides , it features the word " shrubbery
" " ' grail ' is a bit like ' @entity102 , ' " @entity59 observed in the @entity99 ' autobiography
" it 's got a joie de vivre that 's very infectious , it 's very hard not to like
" pros : the dialogue
the @entity108 who say " @entity110
" cons : it 's sometimes sloppy
and it does n't really have an ending
verdict : better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots
probably @entity0 's most consistent movie , " @entity118 " is the story of a guy born down the road from @entity122 who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified
it was a satire on organized religion , first - century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between " the @entity132 " and " the @entity133 " -- but try telling that to the protesters
the film was picketed in cities across the @entity8 , deplored by some religious leaders and banned in @entity138 and @entity139
( @entity79 promoted it with the line , " the film so funny that it was banned in @entity139
" ) it did have one huge supporter : ex-beatle @entity144 , who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out
" he paid for it because he wanted to see it , " @entity59 recalled
" the most anybody 's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history
" pros : @entity34 's performance as @entity154
" what have the @entity155 ever done for us ? " " @entity158
" cons : the adventurous but ultimately pointless animated - alien scene
@entity163 's lisping @entity162 ( though , to be fair , it 's so childishly broad you ca n't help but laugh )
verdict : funnier than the @entity165
" @entity168 , " constructed as a series of sketches , is the most uneven of the three narrative @entity0 films
after the stunning opening sequence , @entity9 's " the @entity172 " -- about the revenge of some pirate - like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing
even the @entity99 thought so
" the rhythms were n't right , " said @entity9
" it needed a whole other rewrite , " said @entity59
nevertheless , it has its moments : the " @entity182 " sequence , about religion , sex and contraception ; the organ donor who 's surprised by a demand for his liver ; and -- of course -- the infamous @entity191 , the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant , regurgitates it at length , and is then encouraged to have a " wafer - thin " after - dinner mint -- with disastrous results
it also has the sweetest of all @entity0 songs : @entity59 's " @entity203 , " which is even more uplifting than " @entity202
" not a bad conclusion , given what happened to mr. creosote
@entity207 : " permanent assurance
" cons : the fish
the schoolmaster 's sex lesson
verdict : more enjoyable than watching the @entity215 competition .
