since @entity3 's @entity2 in 1979 , women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men
but the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top @entity3 sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events
a plan to allow " women and families " to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year , deputy sports minister @entity10 said saturday , according to state - run media
but it is n't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend
according to the state - run @entity19 , @entity10 said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events
the rules wo n't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and " families are not interested in attending " them , @entity19 cited him as saying
@entity3 authorities imposed the ban on women attending men 's sports events after the revolution , deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-islamic
during the ensuing decades , the crowds at soccer games , @entity3 's most popular sport , have been all male
@entity3 women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate president @entity43 , but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard - line @entity45 came to power
the @entity3 government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions
@entity53 president @entity52 called on @entity3 last month to end its " intolerable " ban on women attending soccer matches , saying the situation " can not continue
" @entity3 had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's @entity60 , but the tournament was awarded to the @entity63
the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to @entity3 's chances of securing the event
the ban came under the spotlight at the @entity60 in @entity72 earlier this year , when thousands of female @entity3 fans watched their soccer team without restriction
during the match against @entity78 , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of @entity82 , a @entity83 - @entity3 woman detained in @entity3 last year while trying to watch a volleyball match
@entity3 officials have denied that @entity82 was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for " anti-iran activities
" the news agency @entity89 reported that she was recently pardoned by the @entity90
@entity1 's @entity91 contributed to this report .
