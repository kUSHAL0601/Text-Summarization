@entity4 ? the @entity5 says pope @entity6 may add another leg to his trip to the @entity9 this september , visiting @entity10 just months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two nations
the possibility , which would add a dimension of international intrigue to an already highly anticipated trip , was first reported thursday by @entity17
in response to reporters ' questions , @entity5 spokesman the rev. @entity18 said in a statement , " the holy father has taken into consideration the idea of making a stop in @entity10 " on his way to or from the @entity9 this september
" however , contacts with the @entity10 authorities are still in too early a phase for it to be possible to regard this as a firm decision or an operative plan , " @entity18 continued
@entity6 , the first pontiff to hail from @entity34 , played a key role in the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between @entity10 and the @entity9 , earning praise from both president @entity39 and @entity10 president @entity40
the @entity6 made personal pleas to @entity39 and @entity10 leaders in private letters , writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction
the @entity5 also hosted talks between @entity9 and @entity10 delegations in october , where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed @entity9 contractor @entity54 , who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries
" i want to thank his holiness , @entity6 , whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be , rather than simply settling for the world as it is , " @entity39 said in december as he announced the @entity9 policy shift
since his election in 2013 , @entity6 has displayed a deep interest in international affairs
he repeatedly urged @entity72 leaders not to bomb @entity73 , hosted a prayer service between @entity76 and @entity77 leaders at the @entity5 and waded into diplomatic controversy on sunday by referring to the killing of 1.5 million @entity80 a century ago as a " genocide , " a move that deeply upset @entity84 leaders , who recalled their @entity5 ambassador
the @entity6 is expected to continue his international activism this july with a trip to @entity88 , where he will visit @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91
just a few months later , in late september , @entity6 will visit @entity0 , where he will address @entity92 ; @entity2 , where he will address the @entity93 ; and @entity3 , where he will celebrate a public mass that 's expected to draw more than 1 million people
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity99 on friday , archbishop @entity96 , the @entity6 's host in @entity3 , said he 'd had n't heard about the potential for a papal visit to @entity10 until he turned on the morning news
two previous @entity103 have visited the @entity105 nation : @entity106 in 1998 and former pope @entity107 in 2012 .
