the next week , he was indicted on three counts of first - degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling
he had no prior criminal record , police said
police said " an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking " might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they were n't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime

the victims ' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime

his killing of three college students was despicable , and now he must face the consequences of his actions , " said @entity63 , an attorney for @entity1 ' wife
@entity70 and @entity1 are in the process of divorce .
