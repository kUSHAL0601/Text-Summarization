@entity3 , @entity1 @entity0 is sitting with her youngest grandchild on her lap , wiping away tears with her headscarf
only a few months old , this is the baby girl whose ears she desperately tried to cover the night the aerial bombardment started
she lay awake , she says , in a village mosque on the @entity14 island of @entity15 , counting explosions as the baby cried
it could have been worse though
they could have still been in their house when the first missile landed
" our neighbor shouted to my husband ' you have to leave , they 're coming
' and we just ran
as soon as we left the house , the first missile fell right by it and then a second on it
it burned everything to the ground , " @entity31 tells us
@entity31 and her family fled @entity38 at first light , piling in with three other families
twenty - five of them squeezed into one boat setting sail through the @entity44 to @entity1
@entity44 is one of the busiest waterways in the world , a thoroughfare for oil tankers and cargo ships
it 's now being crossed by desperate @entity14 in rickety fishing boats seeking refuge from the conflict threatening to engulf their country
@entity31 's son @entity57 describes the families ' journey across this part of the @entity61 as " a window into hell
" " the women were violently ill , " he tells us
" it was a catastrophe
" it took them five hours to cross into the north of @entity1 , where the government is providing the refugees with temporary shelter in this unfinished orphanage here in @entity3
and the @entity75 says thousands more refugees are expected
@entity31 and her family will soon have to move to the plastic tents that have been prepared for them on the dusty outskirts of the town , taking with them only the collection of plastic mats and pots neatly stacked in the corner
it 's all that remains of everything they once owned
her two daughters are trapped back in @entity14 , in @entity94
she has n't been able to reach them and the worry she says is almost unbearable
i ask her how many days it was after the @entity100 aerial bombardment began that they left
she looks at me and laughs , " how many days would you have stayed ? " then she goes quiet , looking down at the granddaughter in her lap. finally she tells me , " i thought she would never be able to stop screaming
that the fear would stay with her forever
" " may @entity108 please have mercy on @entity14
