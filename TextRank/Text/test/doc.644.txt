@entity0 has a thing for making out with fellow performers on stage
first it was @entity6 and @entity7 , and now rapper @entity8 has been on the receiving end of a little lip action from @entity11
while the blondes had fun with it , @entity8 appeared less than enthused after @entity0 's prolonged smooch onstage at the @entity17 music festival in @entity18 on sunday
in an update monday from " champagnepapi " himself on @entity23 , the rapper clarified his reaction : " do n't misinterpret my shock ! ! i got to make out with the queen @entity0 and i feel 100 about that forever
" after the kiss , though , he seemed dazed
" oh , s * * *
what the f * * * just happened ? " he asked moments later from the stage
it all went down after @entity8 performed " @entity0 , " a song named for the megastar off his new mixtape " if you 're @entity39 , " according to @entity38
he welcomed @entity41 as a special guest to perform a few songs
while wrapping up " @entity44 , " the @entity45 , 56 , planted one on the seated @entity8 , 28 , who began to flail his arms after a while in an apparent attempt to escape
his sour face after the encounter led many to speculate that he did n't enjoy the kiss
of course , @entity8 and @entity0 's little makeout sesh got the web talking and meme - ing : " so @ @entity8 proves that kissing @ @entity0 is about as ghastly as i always imagined it would be , " wrote former @entity1 personality @entity56
" @entity59 : give @entity60 some suga @entity8 : no no noooooo ! ! ! " wrote another @entity61 .
