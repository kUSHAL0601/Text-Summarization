@entity1 's path to fatherhood was unconventional , but @entity5 's appeals court said tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son 's life
@entity1 's friend , @entity9 , had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant
she thought after she learned she was with child that they should just be friends
she also thought that because they never had sex , she was entitled to be the boy 's sole parent , according to court documents
the @entity19 decided differently in weighing the commonwealth 's assisted conception statute and denying @entity23 's appeal to deny @entity1 visitation
it agreed with a circuit court ruling that method of insemination did n't come from medical technology
" the plain meaning of the term ' medical technology ' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster , " the appeals court wrote in its decision
@entity23 's attorney , @entity38 monday , said she would need to talk to her client before she can comment about whether they will file an appeal
@entity1 initially was hesitant when @entity23 approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea , the court document says
they talked about writing their agreement down on paper , but that never happened
they tried the turkey baster method a few times
he 'd come over to her house , go to a room alone , bring his sperm in a plastic cup , they 'd chat , and he 'd leave
then she 'd use the kitchen utensil and wait
after she did n't get pregnant , she twice tried a fertility doctor
she and @entity1 tried a few more times , and in july , she learned she was going to have a baby
@entity1 came by the house with a stuffed bear and clothes for the baby
he thought he was going to be able to see the newborn as often as he wanted
she thought he could have " some involvement , " the appeals court decision says , but she would be the sole parent
he 'd be like any other friend , certainly not have formal visitation
over what to name the baby
they did n't speak for more than five months after that
the baby was born , and @entity1 says he learned about the baby 's arrival from someone else
he went to the hospital and saw the boy at @entity23 's home
@entity9 said the visits were " strained
" she told @entity1 to stop coming
so he took the matter to court
@entity23 argued that she used " noncoital reproductive technology " to get pregnant , and @entity1 was technically a sperm donor
he argued that he always expected to be a dad , going to the kid 's games and taking part in making decisions on schools and medical needs
a court - ordered dna test proved @entity1 is the biological father
the appeals court affirmed the lower court 's ruling , saying the turkey baster does n't constitute reproductive technology
@entity1 was awarded joint legal custody and visitation
@entity2 also reached out to his attorney tuesday but did n't get a reply
@entity2 's @entity110 contributed to this report .
