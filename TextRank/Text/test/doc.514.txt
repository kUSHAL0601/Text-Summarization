in the hours after the funeral of @entity1 , a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted @entity8 neighborhood went up in flames
the $ 16 million @entity11 was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots , where unemployment rates reach 25 % and poverty and despair is rampant
" disheartened and bewildered " was how the rev. @entity20 , pastor of @entity8 's @entity21 , described feeling tuesday as he surveyed the still - smoldering ruins of the centerpiece of a community rebuilding effort led by his church and a coalition of other congregations
" i see the hopelessness ... and the emotions of the people but i still see hope in @entity33 that we can rise from the ashes , " he said
this can not be the legacy of @entity8
" the project was to include about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center
in the works for eight years , the center was to provide behavioral health counseling , support services for people and families with @entity47 and @entity48 , employment training , home and credit counseling , and ex-offender re-entry services , according to documents filed with the state of @entity55
the cause of the blaze was still under investigation
the brick building burned to the ground in the riots that followed monday 's funeral for @entity1 , who died mysteriously on april 19 , a week after @entity8 police arrested him
anger over @entity1 's death may have spurred monday 's violence -- including buildings and cars set ablaze by rioters , looting and clashes with the police -- but members of @entity8 's clergy said it was also spurred by lasting issues with young african - americans in the city
" we 've been trying to make a major difference , trying to transform the community only to discover that something as tragic as this would take place , " said the rev. @entity76 , pastor of @entity77 -- part of the @entity80 's @entity79
" we saw it coming , " he added
" @entity8 is a tinderbox
we have a lot of anger as a result of unemployment
we have a high rate of incarceration
" high concentrations of poverty , underfunded and failing schools , neglected public housing projects and a lack of employment opportunities have been among the social issues long simmering below @entity8 's crumbling row houses , according to the local church leaders
" i think the reason that they burned it is exactly the reason why we needed it , " @entity20 said of the community center
" we were seeking to restore people while we rebuilt properties
we wanted to effect change in the human community as well as rebuild properties with affordable housing
" the rev. @entity113 , pastor of @entity114 and member of the coalition , said parts of @entity8 have not recovered from the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the rev. @entity120 those riots sped up the flight of city residents to the suburbs
unemployment soared with the disappearance of blue - collar jobs
the drug scourge in the 1980s tore the community apart further
" the message was that our young people are not valued , " @entity113 said
new prisons were built , @entity113 said
hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into the revitalization of the historic @entity135 , a renaissance that eluded communities such as @entity8
" when you look at that kind of despair , when you look at people who notice beauty in a city that they can not even access , it creates such an undercurrent of anger , frustration and hopelessness , that 's not going to be fixed quickly , " @entity113 said
@entity113 recalled driving along downtown 's @entity151 on tuesday , near the @entity135 , the streets teeming with @entity155 and state police officers
" when i left downtown and came into @entity8 , i see no @entity157 , no troopers , " he said
" it sends a message that it 's a priority to protect the areas of the city where a lot of the money has been poured , where the wealth is
what 's missed is , it 's really not smart or wise in the long term to try to isolate certain problems in certain neighborhoods
what may start off as one neighborhood 's problems soon become the city 's problem
" @entity20 said the senior housing complex and community center was to open in november or december
the partner churches are expected to complete other projects offering affordable housing and mixed - use developments in @entity8
the center is being built by @entity183 , a low - income housing developer
@entity185 , senior vice president of @entity183 , said : " we are fully committed to rebuilding
" on tuesday , @entity188 , a representative of @entity189 , one of the largest african - american church architecture firms in the nation , offered a free conceptual rendering and design consultation for the rebuilding , @entity9 affiliate @entity187 reported
@entity20 , @entity113 and other clergy members on monday night met with gang members in an attempt to stem the street violence
@entity113 said it was the first time such a gathering took place
@entity20 called it a breakthrough
" young people just needed somebody to sit and talk to them and hear them cry , " @entity20 said , looking out over the ruins of the community project
this is , i do n't know what else to do
if we can rebuild @entity216 , we can rebuild @entity8
" @entity9 's @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .
