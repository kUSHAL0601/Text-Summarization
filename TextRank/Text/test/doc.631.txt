@entity0 is such a dad
the @entity3 legend called out @entity4 on @entity5 for saying he only eats " hood doughnuts
" in response , the elder @entity0 -- in front of his 912,000 followers -- reminded his son he has a trust fund , a condo and his own clothing line called " @entity14
" " you 're a @entity16 with a million $ trust fund
stop the hood stuff ! " @entity0 followed it up with another tweet that included the hashtags # versacesheets # @entity16 and # @entity22
junior is a wide receiver at @entity24 , an aspiring entrepreneur and occasional rapper
his @entity5 timeline is a mix of biblical verses , motivational quotes and references to sports , cars , school and @entity36 shoes
he also has gone on record with his love for " hood doughnuts , " or confections from " a place in the hood , " saying " if my doughnuts do n't come in a plain white box , i do n't want them ! " his father promptly put him in his place
@entity4 seemed to take the public browbeating in stride , retweeting his father 's comments
at least he knew better than to delete them .
