about a quarter of a million @entity2 homes and businesses have no power after a " once in a decade " storm battered @entity6 and nearby areas
about 4,500 people have been isolated by flood waters as " the roads are cut off and we wo n't be able to reach them for a few days , " @entity8 , spokesman for the @entity9 said
devastating winds lashed cars and homes
the storm system also brought destructive flooding that washed away houses and brought down trees onto streets and buildings
the emergency services have been slammed with 13,000 calls for help due to flooding and have carried out 144 rescue tasks
the powerful storm has already claimed four lives , according to @entity30
the dangerous conditions have prompted the police department to issue pleas on social media for people to not attempt driving through flooded areas
the heavy flooding prompted school and college closures and disruptions to public transportation
the adverse weather was caused by an intense low pressure system , said @entity2 's @entity44
the strongest wind gusts peaked at 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) and it was estimated that about 200 millimeters ( 7.87 inches ) of rainfall fell in the area on tuesday

@entity64 was driving in her neighborhood of @entity66 , a suburb in @entity6 on wednesday , when she noticed gallons of water pouring into the streets
she said @entity71 , a nearby park , was flooded
the severe weather caused a local creek to break its banks and now the flooding is seeping into the neighborhood
water levels at the park reached 2.6 meters ( 8.5 feet ) earlier in the morning , but have slightly receded , she said .
