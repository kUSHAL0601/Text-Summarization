@entity0 used to travel abroad to get their fix of luxury goods
however these days , they can take a stroll around @entity5 , an exclusive neighborhood in @entity6 where brands like @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 line the streets
the @entity13 city is among @entity15 metropolises which have seen some of the highest growth in the number of millionaires on the continent
others include @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , which is predicted to nearly double its millionaire count from 800 in 2012 to 1,500 in 2020
if the growth continues , these cities could join an existing club of @entity15 wealth hubs hosting the so - called ultra-high net worth individuals , typically those with over $ 30 million of net assets excluding their primary residence
these centers of affluence are spread from @entity36 in the south , through @entity6 in the west and @entity39 in the east , to @entity41 in the north
this emerging class of @entity45 's new millionaires has been pushing the demand for luxury products across the continent , with sales of high - end products growing by a third between 2008 and 2013
however , they are no longer concentrated in southern @entity45 , traditionally the wealthiest part of the continent
@entity13 is now one of the fastest growing markets for @entity57 and digital televisions according to a report by @entity59 , and in 2013 @entity61 's seven @entity13 branches outsold its 600 @entity15 stores
" @entity45 is one of the fastest growing regions in terms of middle class , " says @entity63 , head of luxury at @entity65 , a market research provider
" it 's due to a mix of rising incomes , rising population but also growth slowing in other emerging markets
" luxury brands tend to enter country markets through distributors , benefiting from local knowledge of their partners but still retaining a significant amount of control over how their name is marketed in that country
" getting a new brand in a new market where they do n't fully understand the operating environment would be very dangerous for that brand , " explains @entity63
she warns that in spite of potential , the future of luxury in @entity45 is dependent on reforms taking place : " it will rely on infrastructure and the operating environment such as security and how trading is done , " she says
when it comes to what they choose to splash their cash on , @entity45 's rich like to stick to well - known global labels that carry an automatic badge of status
" generally the brands they buy will be more ostentatious compared to somebody in the more developed , mature markets
it 's going to be the @entity116 , the @entity117 , the @entity118 , " says @entity63
she adds that this could be down to the fact that typical a luxury consumer in @entity45 is much younger than those in mature markets such as @entity124 , who tend to be in their 50s and 60s
" they are in their late twenties or thirties so it 's very much new wealth , and they will be looking towards luxury as a means of showing status and success , " says @entity63
however , in spite of mainstream brand 's dominance , smaller home - grown labels also see the growth in appetite for luxury goods as a valuable opportunity
" @entity45 has all the foundations that are needed to create a real vibrant luxury industry , " says @entity147 , @entity148 entrepreneur and founder of the @entity36 - based luxury tea brand @entity151
" we have the craftsmanship , we have the heritage , we have a very rich culture that does n't date just 20 years , but centuries , thousands and thousands of years of know - how and craftsmanship
so here is this continent where you have all the raw material and the know - how , but what is missing is the link to luxury
" now is the time and you need to start positioning yourself , because @entity45 is getting richer , that 's for sure , " she adds
