@entity0 accused @entity2 of illegally holding one of its cargo ships wednesday and demanded the release of the vessel and crew
the ship , the @entity10 , was detained after it ran aground off the coast of @entity2 in july
@entity2 defended the move wednesday , saying it followed proper protocol because the company that owns the ship , @entity0 's @entity17 company , has skirted @entity19 sanctions
" because the company has avoided the sanctions imposed by the @entity23 , the @entity2 government is acting on the basis of its international obligations as a responsible @entity19 member state , " the @entity20 of @entity2 to the @entity19 said
the @entity23 blacklisted @entity17 in july , saying it " played a key role in arranging the shipment of concealed arms and related materiel " on another ship , the @entity32 , which was detained by @entity33 in 2013
but an @entity34 , @entity0 's deputy ambassador to the @entity19 , said there was no reason to hold the @entity37 and accused @entity2 of violating the crew members ' human rights by keeping them from their families
" @entity10 is a peaceful , merchant ship and it has not shipped any items prohibited by international laws or regulations , " @entity41 told reporters at the @entity19 headquarters wednesday
" and we have already paid full compensation to @entity2 authorities according to its domestic laws
" according to @entity2 's @entity19 mission , the 33 @entity0 nationals who make up the vessel 's crew are free , staying at a hotel in the port city of @entity59 and regularly visiting the ship to check on it
they will soon be sent back to @entity0 with help from the country 's embassy , @entity2 authorities said
in the case of the @entity32 , @entity33 authorities found it was carrying undeclared weaponry from @entity67 -- including @entity69 fighter jets , anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar
@entity33 seized the cargo and held onto the ship and its crew for months
@entity0 eventually agreed to pay a fine of $ 666,666 for the vessel 's release
