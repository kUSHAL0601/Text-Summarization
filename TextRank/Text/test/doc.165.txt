desperate migrants from @entity4 and the @entity5 keep heading to @entity6 , with 978 rescued friday in the @entity7 , the @entity1 @entity0 said saturday via @entity8
the migrants were picked up 30 miles off the coast of @entity11 , said @entity13 member @entity12 , the leader of @entity1 's far - right @entity14
in the first three months of 2015 , @entity1 registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving , the @entity16 said , and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of april in the @entity18
most migrants recorded this year come from countries in @entity4 as well as @entity22 and @entity23 , the @entity19 said
they use @entity11 as a country of transit
at least 480 migrants have died while crossing the @entity7 since the beginning of the year , often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers , the @entity19 said
sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships , leaving passengers to fend for themselves
at this time last year , there were fewer than 50 deaths reported , the @entity19 said
most of the migrants are asylum seekers , victims of trafficking or violence , unaccompanied children and pregnant women .
