@entity1 betting company @entity0 is backtracking after tweeting that " @entity3 have suffered more @entity5 beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed @entity8 - @entity7 male
" the tweet , a pun on the name of the famous home end at @entity13 , alluded to recent controversial incidents in the @entity7 in which unarmed @entity8 - @entity7 men have been killed by police
@entity0 -- well - known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between @entity13 and @entity3 ahead of their @entity24 match on monday
a @entity0 spokesman told @entity2 before @entity13 's 2 - 0 victory at @entity27 : " it was a joke , and no offense was meant
" the tweet has since been deleted , but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization , with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked
in january , @entity0 attracted headlines after backing @entity41 's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football 's governing body
the former @entity46 and @entity47 player could not persuade enough @entity49 football associations to back his bid
he needed five to have any chance of unseating @entity52
@entity0 started the funding for the candidacy , but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss @entity41 's bid as another attempt to grab headlines
@entity0 , the son of one the company 's founders and its marketing spokesman , explained : " we 've been known for some mischievous activity around the world
" last year , the company generated anger when it promised " money back if he walks " in relation to the trial of disgraced @entity75
monday 's win put @entity13 fifth in the table , four points behind defending champion @entity80 , which holds @entity84 's final @entity83 qualification spot with six games left to play this season
@entity84 forward @entity87 , who has turned down a new contract , scored a fine solo goal in the first half , and midfielder @entity92 's 70th - minute strike condemned 13th - placed @entity3 to a fifth successive league defeat
@entity3 , which had @entity95 international midfielder @entity94 sent off in the 83rd minute , has not won at @entity27 since a 1 - 0 victory in the @entity97 in november 1995 .
