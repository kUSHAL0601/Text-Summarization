hi - ho , @entity2 has some competition
a newly discovered species of glassfrog looks an awful lot like the famous @entity7
bulging white eyes , kelly green skin , the works
but the name 's not nearly so catchy as its famous counterpart : hyalinobatrachium dianae , or @entity15 's bare - hearted glassfrog
if you have to , you can call it @entity18 for short
scientists found the species on the @entity22 slopes of @entity23
this is big news in the scientific community
the last time a new glassfrog was found in @entity23 was back in 1973 , according to the @entity27
" @entity23 is known to have 14 glassfrogs inhabiting its tiny national territory ! " the center 's @entity29 page said
it 's called a glassfrog because of its translucent belly
you can see its internal organs from underneath
@entity39 was n't immediately available for comment .
