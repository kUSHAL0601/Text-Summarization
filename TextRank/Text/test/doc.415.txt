the cover - up is often worse than the crime
@entity3 stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his @entity7 documentary series " finding your roots " because the actor @entity10 put pressure on him
@entity10 's concern was that the segment would have aired his family 's dirty laundry , which includes a slaveholding ancestor , @entity16
@entity10 said , in a statement posted on @entity18 , that he " did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves
" and @entity3 later explained that he subbed that part of the segment for another that made for more " compelling television
" but providing a window into the importance of slavery 's past to @entity33 's present should never just be about what makes for good television
and @entity10 's initial reluctance to acknowledge his truth ( an impulse , he said on @entity18 , he regrets ) is surprising
last month , @entity10 lent his star power to support continued foreign assistance for the @entity42 by testifying before @entity43
he is n't shy about aligning himself with causes and issues
what more could he do if his instinct is also to tackle issues closer to home : the legacy of slavery in his own family tree and how it is possible -- necessary -- to reject the racism passed through generations even today
he should have shown the courage to stay in an uncomfortable place
what a teachable moment for the country
in any case , why did he agree to do a television show if he was concerned about what might be discovered ? he could have paid a genealogist to uncover his ancestry , if privacy was what he wanted
the irony here is that none of this would have ever been found out if @entity72 's emails had not been hacked and if @entity3 had n't written to @entity73 , ceo of @entity72 , for advice
in the leaked exchange , @entity73 advised : " i would take it out if no one knows , but if it gets out that you are editing the material based on this kind of sensitivity then it gets tricky
" @entity3 acknowledges that to delete the segment at the request of a guest " would be a violation of @entity7 rules
" then he does it anyway
gates , however , denies doing this
after the story came to light , he released a statement saying that he " maintained editorial control " and decided what made " for the most compelling program
" for @entity10 's " @entity99 " segment , he substituted a @entity101 ancestor instead of the slave - owning one
if @entity3 thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it did n't make for good television , there would have been no need to consult with @entity73 ; @entity90 could have given @entity10 what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong @entity10 's story was
the original script , reprinted on @entity112 and elsewhere , makes it clear , however , that the slave - owner angle makes for better television
here are some excerpts : @entity3 sets up the segment describing @entity16 as living in @entity118 , @entity119
@entity10 responds that he has a house in @entity118
@entity3 says " really ? " and asks whether he knew he had roots there
@entity10 says he had no idea he had any @entity125 roots at all
then the voice - over lowers the boom : " we wanted to see if we could learn how @entity10 's ancestor felt about ( slavery )
" @entity3 shows the slave schedule of the @entity132 to @entity10 , who says , " there 's @entity16 , owned 25 slaves
" @entity10 says , " it gives me a kind of sagging feeling to see , uh , a biological relationship to that
but you know , there it is , part of our history
" @entity3 then says : " but consider the irony , in your family line
your mom went back fighting for the rights of black people in @entity153 , 100 years later
" @entity10 then observes : " indeed , people like my mother and many others who have made a much better @entity33 than the one that they were handed
" what a great line
and indeed when a public figure -- a celebrity -- chooses to confront the past like this , instead of ignoring it , he can provide a powerful example to a country that struggles daily with the roots of racism in its present
this is the kind of enlightened approach @entity3 and @entity7 should have been interested in facilitating
@entity175 ' lack of comfort in talking about slavery , race and the places in our society where racism continues to fester is at the heart of why even with a black president , we are still , as a country , far from post-racial
@entity10 's segment had the potential to continue an important dialogue -- but the brand management part of @entity10 won , and the rest is history
@entity3 has to deal with @entity7 and @entity195 's internal review
he should not walk away without consequences
if you 're going to run with the megastars , you need to have mega-ethics .
