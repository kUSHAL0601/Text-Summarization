a fiery sunset greeted people in @entity3 sunday
the deep reddish color caught @entity7 native @entity6 's eye
he photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on @entity13
the stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of @entity18
" the dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had @entity7 locals wondering where the amber - colored haze was originating from , " @entity19 said
the fires were started in southeastern @entity18 , by farmers burning grass in their fields
but on april 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity33
as a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region
rescue crews were able to put out the flames
however , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds
the winds carried the smoke from @entity18 across the @entity45 and brought it to the @entity46
parts of @entity48 , @entity3 and @entity49 are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination
the reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , @entity33 said
that means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered
the colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye
as the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .
