that was the sentiment of many " @entity3 " fans on tuesday after star @entity5 announced she will be leaving the @entity7 show at the end of this season
" i always knew i wanted @entity11 's story to be a six season adventure , and within those six years i got the journey of a lifetime , " she posted on her social media accounts after a " goodbye party " at @entity18 outside @entity19 , where the show is filmed
" i was a human , a vampire , a doppelganger , a crazy immortal , a doppelganger pretending to be human , a human pretending to be a doppelganger
i got kidnapped , killed , resurrected , tortured , cursed , body - snatched , was dead and undead , and there 's still so much more to come before the season finale in may
" and while that may be true , fans were feeling a little jilted
many chastised the show 's producers , some even @entity5 herself , for allowing the show to go on to a seventh season this fall after she departs
many were upset that @entity5 's departure could sink hopes of seeing a satisfying denouement to the relationship between @entity5 's character , @entity11 , and love interest vampire @entity41
fans called the couple " @entity45
" " i feel angry , sad , depressed , numb but most of all i feel like part of me died along with @entity5 leaving @entity47
nothing will be the same again , " @entity49 user @entity48 posted
producer @entity51 issued a statement supporting @entity5 's decision
" @entity5 is excited to spread her wings , get some rest , travel the world and also take it by storm , and we support her a thousand-fold , " she said in the statement , according to media accounts
" we will miss @entity5 and the four hundred characters she played , but we look forward to the insane and exciting challenge of continuing to tell stories of our @entity65 and our much - loved and gifted ensemble
" no thanks , some fans said
@entity5 seemed to anticipate the pain , urging fans to hold on through the show 's finale next month
" if you think you know what 's coming , you do n't , " she said .
