@entity0 has executed a second @entity3 maid despite protests from @entity5 , which is itself facing fierce criticism for its failure to heed calls for clemency for a number of foreigners on death row
the @entity3 government summoned the @entity0 ambassador to the foreign ministry on thursday after learning that 37 - year - old @entity16
@entity17 had been beheaded , without official warning
@entity19 was sentenced to death in march 2013 for killing her employer 's four - year - old child
she was the second @entity3 domestic worker executed by the @entity0 this week , following the death of @entity24
@entity25 on tuesday -- the execution again carried out with @entity3 officials receiving no prior warning
" that is our main issue
it 's not that suddenly there was an execution
we did n't know when it would take place
still , we took over a hundred steps to try to free ( @entity24 ) from execution , " said @entity37 , spokesman for @entity3 's @entity38
@entity24 , 47 , was convicted of killing her employer 's wife in 1999 , but the death penalty was delayed until the youngest of the victim 's sons reached puberty and was old enough to consider requesting her pardon
rights groups say they suspect @entity24 was mentally ill and cast aspersions on claims she had confessed to the crime
@entity53 also said reports suggested she had been abused while working in the victim 's home
" imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity , " said @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity61 programme director at @entity53
in a statement , the @entity3 government said the protection of its citizens abroad was a " priority " and listed the attempts it had made to help @entity24 , including providing legal aid , writing letters to the @entity75 and " continuous efforts ... to ask for forgiveness from the family
" @entity3 said in many cases its efforts had worked
from july 2011 to the end of march this year , it said it had " successfully freed " 238 of its citizens from the death penalty
one of those was @entity86 who was sentenced to death in 2011 after reportedly admitting to killing her 70 - year - old employer and stealing $ 10,000
@entity86 claimed she acted in self - dense
days before her scheduled execution , the @entity3 government stepped in with so - called " blood money " of 7 million @entity0 riyals -- at the time worth about $ 1.8 million
@entity3 's efforts to save its own citizens does not sit well with advocates who are seeking the same mercy for foreigners languishing on @entity3 's death row
two of the most high profile cases are @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity103 convicted of attempting to smuggle heroin from @entity105 to @entity103 in 2005
friday marks the 10 - year anniversary of their arrest with seven other people -- members of the so - called " @entity109 " -- who are currently serving lengthy sentences in @entity3 prisons
as the alleged ringleaders , @entity101 and @entity102 were sentenced to death , and denied clemency from president @entity115 , a decision being challenged through the country 's @entity117
" if @entity3 wants to effectively protect @entity3 from the death penalty abroad , @entity3 should also abolish the death penalty here , " said @entity119 , one of the men 's lawyers
@entity101 , 31 , and @entity102 -- who also turns 34 on friday -- are currently incarcerated on @entity125 in preparation for their execution but no date has been set
@entity130 called on @entity115 to suspend all planned executions in @entity3 -- as the previous government did between 2008 and 2013
no executions were carried out in 2014 , but earlier this year , six people -- including five foreigners -- faced the firing squad
" the executions of two @entity3 citizens in @entity0 in a single week should be a turning point on the subject of death penalty in @entity3 , " said @entity137 , the @entity3 researcher for @entity130
" please stop the lecture of sovereignty
it is so old fashioned
" before news of the second execution emerged on thursday , the @entity3 @entity38 held a press briefing to denounce the @entity0 action
when asked whether @entity5 's complaints smacked of hypocrisy , given the country 's refusal to spare foreigners on death row , spokesman @entity37 said : " if you read our constitution , it is the job , the role of the government to protect its citizens , right ? so it 's not a double standard
" " on the issue of death penalty , we can have a long debate whether it is against human rights or it is morally wrong or right
that 's a whole other discussion , that 's a whole other argument , but what we 're saying now here is we are implementing our laws and we are adhering to our constitution that we have to protect our citizens abroad
