@entity1 inside a plane at @entity1 , baggage handlers are going on a shopping spree with passengers ' bags
what they do n't know is that they are being recorded on a hidden camera
the @entity9 set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes
email your story ideas and tips to @entity20
" it 's a problem we all face , " said police lt. @entity21
" we will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease
" @entity1 aviation director @entity27 said the insider theft cases " are indeed the exception among the thousands of decent , hardworking employees at @entity1 , and they have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes
" and these insider thefts just do n't happen in @entity1
a @entity2 analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the @entity39 from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables , mostly packed in checked luggage
the rest occurred at security checkpoints
total property loss claimed : $ 2.5 million
@entity46 in @entity47 topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage , followed by @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity1 , according to the data
the problem has been so serious at @entity46 that in 2013 , @entity57 set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold
the camera showed baggage handlers stealing items on flights bound for @entity63 , including a $ 5,000 @entity65 watch , iphones , an @entity67 , cameras , gold rings and cash
six of those arrested pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property or petty larceny and the seventh suspect 's case was sealed , according to the @entity77
the high - profile case , though , did n't stop the thefts
two more baggage handlers at @entity46 were arrested in 2014 after authorities said they stole two designer handbags from a suitcase , and then tried to sell them on @entity84
then , in december , seven more @entity46 baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage
the items were stolen from suitcases of passengers traveling to or from @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and various @entity99 cities
in @entity1 , which aggressively goes after luggage thieves , police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012 , including six so far this year
police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items
another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way
" insider threat is very scary for us in law enforcement , and certainly someone taking somebody 's cell phone , @entity67 , computer -- what 's next ? " @entity21 said
a @entity2 investigation earlier this year found that @entity1 and @entity127 are the only two major airports in the country that require employees to be screened through metal detectors
@entity1 even checks employees when they leave work to go into the main terminal
but that apparently has n't stopped the luggage thieves
" as far as being able to get the property off the airfield , that 's a great question , " @entity21 said
" in @entity53 , police last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals
among the valuables found were computers , watches , jewelry and cameras and designer bags
sixteen airport workers were fired
" we cut theft in those two terminals by 60 % because of doing that aggressive investigative work , " said @entity154 , police chief of @entity53
luggage theft could definitely lead to more serious problems , he said
" i absolutely think that if we do n't pay attention to the small things that happen around here , that it could lead to much larger things
so there is , i believe , a connection between baggage theft and terrorism , " @entity154 said
even the @entity39 has had problem employees
since 2002 , the agency has fired 513 officers for theft
it employs about 50,000 officers today , and last year screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry - ons
@entity175 : guns smuggled on planes by @entity180 employee ' egregious ' security breach luggage theft is n't confined to airport workers
outsiders have been caught on surveillance cameras stealing luggage from carousels
@entity2 contacted airports around the country and found while the total thefts from carousels are relatively low , it continues to be a problem
for example , @entity191 reported 214 luggage thefts from carousels and other airport locations last year , 200 in @entity196 , 36 in @entity197 , 35 in @entity198 , 15 at @entity200 @entity199 , 14 at @entity201 and 10 at @entity203 's @entity202
odd @entity39 finds @entity2 's @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report .
