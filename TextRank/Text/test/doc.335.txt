@entity0 @entity3 campaign calculations , the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns , a @entity10 ticket for the generations , and @entity10 calendar concerns filled our sunday trip around the " @entity16 " table
watch the volume as @entity18 uses @entity19 to test @entity3 pokes slowly but clearly , former @entity21 gov. @entity18 is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming @entity24 presidential front - runner @entity23
how aggressive will he get ? stay tuned -- literally
@entity1 's @entity25 says @entity18 enjoys using @entity19 videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by @entity3 , like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver 's licenses
" every time @entity23 sort of adjusts her positioning from ' 08 to ' 16 -- her statement on the drivers ' licenses that we discussed and other things -- @entity18 has been releasing a @entity19 video showing a speech where he has done something different , so watch for that to continue , " said @entity25
" those @entity19 videos on his channel will be a key part of the race -- the liberals love them
the " @entity55 factor " : @entity3 finds a lot to love , and some distance @entity23 is a big fan of president @entity55 's health care law , but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style
so reports @entity64 's @entity63 , who was in @entity65 this past week for the @entity3 campaign rollout , and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime @entity55 2008 rival who , of course , went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state
" she embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law , for his push for immigration legislation -- but it was n't all sunshine and light , " said @entity63
" she also took subtle digs at his leadership style â€” she said @entity86 was on the wrong track -- i ca n't believe i 'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a @entity10
in big policy choice , @entity3 signals an important campaign focus in @entity24 politics , @entity92 is the @entity94 sister who gets the most national buzz
but @entity96 is about to play a big role in the question of how @entity23 plots her path to 270 electoral votes
@entity101 is the @entity102 attorney general and a 2016 @entity104 candidate , for the seat being vacated by @entity107 @entity106
@entity96 just signed on for a top policy role in the @entity3 campaign -- and @entity1 's @entity110 reports it is a hiring with a clear message
" one clue , i think , is @entity96 , " said @entity113
" her resume is really a liberal 's dream
she has worked at the @entity118 , @entity119 , she 's also done work on community policing and police reforming , and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate
" " so i think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that @entity23 rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color , who are so crucial to getting the @entity55 coalition back together again
@entity136 ? @entity137 ? a general contrast with some @entity10 buzz @entity140 drew a direct generational contrast with @entity23 when he officially joined the @entity10 2106 race , and @entity144 gov. @entity143 also often talks of his hope republicans will look for a next - generation leader as their next presidential nominee
in political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail
but @entity159 of the @entity160 says his recent travels suggest the talk about a @entity143 - @entity136 pairing is not limited to inside the @entity165 chatter
" they both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that @entity3 and @entity170 did ... in 1992 , " said @entity159
" but what 's interesting is , in @entity172 over the weekend , i was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates , for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- i heard somebody float the idea of a @entity143 - @entity136 race in 2016
@entity65 , @entity172 , @entity182 and then ? heading into the 2016 cycle , the @entity183 used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process , including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front - loaded
now , some big @entity10 establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially @entity195 sen. @entity194
@entity65 , @entity172 and @entity182 keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar
@entity200 is usually the next big contest , but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the " @entity206 primary
" it is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress
but what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a @entity214 -- or maybe back - to - back tuesdays -- in early march that include a number of conservative @entity218 states : @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity195 , @entity222 , maybe @entity223
the shift is one reason former @entity220 gov. @entity226 thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008
they did well in the @entity182 , but it did n't matter much because @entity232 and @entity233 , respectively , were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted
again , there might yet be more changes
but more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like @entity246 or @entity140 -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like @entity226 and @entity194 .
