a sexual harassment complaint has been filed against @entity3 prime minister @entity2 after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an @entity8 cafe
@entity0 affiliate @entity9 reported that the complaint was filed thursday morning by @entity11 , an accountant described in the @entity3 press as a " serial litigant , " who has previously launched private prosecutions against @entity2
@entity11 's complaint claimed that @entity2 had breached a section of the country 's @entity18 relating to sexual harassment , @entity9 reported
it reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress , 26 - year - old @entity22 , and " if she does not want it i ask for the money be given to @entity26
" @entity2 publicly apologized to @entity22 , a waitress at his local cafe , for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail , after she complained about his behavior in a blog post
the post , published on @entity3 political website @entity32 , says that the odd behavior began during last year 's election season
it was " hardly an acceptable form of greeting , " @entity22 wrote
she wrote that while she did n't directly make her objections clear verbally , her body language " screamed ' i do n't like that
' " " as he approached me , he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary , suspense sound effects , like the music from the movie ' @entity48 ' , " read the post
" as he towered overhead i slunk down , cringing , whilst ( @entity2 's wife ) @entity49 told him to ' leave the poor girl alone
' " the behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions , the post states
eventually the cafe 's manager made it clear to @entity2 that his actions were unwelcome
@entity2 , who regularly visits the @entity8 cafe with his wife , told reporters that his behavior was in the context of " a bit of banter , " but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense
the blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own @entity75 @entity74 wine by way of apology
" we have lots of fun and games there , there 's always lots of practical jokes and things
it 's a very warm and friendly relationship , " he told reporters in @entity87 en route to @entity90 day commemorations in @entity91 , @entity92
" but if you look at it now , no. when i realized she took offense by that i just sort of immediately went back , gave her some wine , apologized and said i was terribly sorry
" politicians and public figures also rounded on @entity2 , with @entity103 mp @entity102 saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate
" a lot of @entity3 know what it 's like to feel as if you 're not taken seriously in a job
as politicians , our job is to make people feel safe at work , not bullied , " @entity3 media reported her as saying
" it 's a sign of how out of touch @entity2 has become when he ca n't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is , and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving
" @entity122 , head of the @entity123 , echoed the sentiment
" it 's never ok to touch someone without their permission , " @entity9 reported her as saying
" there are no exceptions
" political analyst @entity131 told the network that the " strangeness factor " of the accusation would haunt @entity2
" a lot of people will be laughing at @entity2 , that 's harder to recover from , " he said in a segment
the @entity139 , while accepting that @entity2 was joking and did not mean to offend , criticized the premier
" the fact that our prime minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture
and it starts at the top , " the organization 's chief executive @entity150 wrote in an open letter
" up and down this country , day after day , people are touched without giving their consent
at one end of the scale , it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail
at the other end , it 's our shocking levels of violence against women
