@entity0 , 73 , shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police
@entity0 was a reserve deputy sheriff , which allowed him to " work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the @entity12 and @entity13 , " according to the @entity15 's website
but @entity0 was n't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled
he had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force , according to his lawyer
on april 2 , @entity0 thought he was going to use a taser on @entity24 , who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a @entity28 pistol and then took off running
but @entity0 was n't holding a taser
he was holding his gun
he fired one shot and killed @entity24
from a policing perspective , there was n't even good reason to use a taser against @entity24
@entity24 was n't getting the upper hand
he was n't going anywhere
and despite what @entity0 would later claim , @entity24 was not running like a man with a gun
in fact , @entity24 was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband
what was @entity0 , an insurance company ceo , doing there in the first place ? it certainly looks like @entity0 was given special access to " real " policing
@entity24 had given $ 2,500 to sheriff @entity56 's re-election campaign
he donated cars to the department
so it would be noteworthy if @entity0 ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by " sunglass cameras " that he may have purchased for the department
a @entity13 police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies , many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police
" that 's not unusual at all , " he told the @entity69
maybe @entity0 could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything
but i doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force
he was too old to be policing the streets
@entity13 police said that @entity0 had served a year in 1964 as a police officer
most police departments have mandatory retirement ages
federal law - enforcement officers , for instance , retire at 57
how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers
for one thing , it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free
but departments also know that you get what you pay for
what is the point of background checks , psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol ? some people are a little too eager to be police officers
these people perhaps buy a police - like car for their personal car
maybe they put in a police light or two
some have actually made car stops
police departments hate cop impersonators ( it 's illegal , by the way ) and try and weed them during the hiring process
you want workers who like the job , but not too much ; there 's a fine line between passion and fanaticism
that said , there are good volunteer police officers
@entity130 , for example , has auxiliary police
these officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities
they wear an @entity137 uniform but do not carry a gun
auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police
volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling , and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized @entity152 officers
an auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge
it can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job is n't for them before they are locked into a 20 - year commitment
what happened in @entity166 is a disgrace to police professionalism , and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs
that would be a mistake
police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public
but a line does need to be drawn .
