the @entity0 has decided to proceed with a screening of the film " @entity4 " despite objections from some students
more than 200 students signed a petition asking the school not to show the movie as part of @entity12 , a series of social events the university stages for students
@entity17 was nominated for an @entity18 for his portrayal of @entity20 , a @entity22 seal and the most lethal sniper in @entity25 military history
@entity20 was fatally shot at a @entity27 shooting range in 2013
some students believed the movie 's depiction of the @entity31 reflected negatively on the @entity32 and people from that region
@entity0 's @entity36 metropolitan area is home to the nation 's largest @entity39 - @entity25 population
but there was a backlash to the decision to yank the movie , and a counter-petition asked school officials to reconsider
on wednesday , @entity47 , @entity0 's vice president for student life , said in a statement that " it was a mistake to cancel the showing of the movie ' @entity4 ' on campus as part of a social event for students " and that the show will go on
" the initial decision to cancel the movie was not consistent with the high value the @entity0 places on freedom of expression and our respect for the right of students to make their own choices in such matters , " the statement said
@entity12 will offer a screening of the family - friendly " @entity71 " for those who would rather not attend " @entity4
" the announcement drew praise from @entity0 head football coach @entity76 .
