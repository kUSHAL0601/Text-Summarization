@entity6 leader @entity5 has backed out of next month 's visit to @entity0 for @entity9 anniversary celebrations , @entity4 spokesman @entity3 said thursday
" we were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels , " @entity3 said
" the decision is connected with @entity6 domestic affairs
" the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked @entity5 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of @entity6 in late 2011
he was to have met with @entity19 president @entity18 as part of the may visit to coincide with @entity22 , marking the 70th anniversary of the @entity25 's victory over @entity26 in @entity9 @entity5 also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments , including the leaders of @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity26 , @entity35 and @entity36
this number represents about half the world leaders that @entity19 has said it invited to the celebrations
@entity5 's trip had been anticipated since late december , when @entity19 state media reported that @entity0 had extended an invitation
there was no further explanation , from @entity0 or @entity45 , as to why he would n't head west
still , @entity6 has a number of issues it 's been wrestling with for years
they include widespread poverty , its longstanding spat with neighboring @entity52 and the @entity53 , as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program
and news about @entity5 's non-visit comes a day after @entity52 intelligence agents told lawmakers that @entity5 is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year
@entity1 can not independently confirm the executions detailed by @entity64 , a lawmaker with the @entity65 who attended the closed briefing
and the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear
that said , @entity6 is one of the most closed societies in the world
and there 's little doubt that @entity5 is very much in charge
according to @entity64 , intelligence officials say the @entity6 leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own
@entity1 's @entity82 and @entity83 contributed to this report
@entity1 's @entity85 reported from @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity86 and @entity87 wrote this story from @entity89 .
