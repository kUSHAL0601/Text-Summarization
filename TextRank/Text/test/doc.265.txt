it 's a girls ' universe
on wednesday , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 announced a partnership to launch @entity7 , featuring familiar superheroes and supervillains as " relatable teens , " according to a press release
( like @entity1 , @entity3 and @entity4 are units of @entity13
) the characters involved include @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , among others
though initial reaction on social media appeared favorable -- " my daughter will be a big fan i think , " wrote @entity23 -- praise was n't universal
" just let us into the old universes ! " tweeted @entity26
and @entity29 , writing for @entity30 of @entity31 , was concerned the initiative was another way of keeping girls separate
" targeting them as ' for girls only ' is just another way to be exclusive , " she wrote
" look , i appreciate the effort , but drawing yet another line between men and women is not the way to go
so , where are you going to put these products in @entity45 ? on the pink side of the toy section or the blue side ? " @entity7 is aimed at girls ages 6 - 12 and will include online content , toys , books and tv specials
@entity5 is the toy licensee and @entity54 will publish books based on the franchise
the first elements will roll out in the fall .
