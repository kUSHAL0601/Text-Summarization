the author of a 2006 novel has accused the " @entity7 " director and " cabin " director @entity4 of stealing his idea
with just weeks until his box - office victory lap for " @entity7 : @entity13 , " @entity9 is now facing a lawsuit accusing him of stealing the idea for the 2012 meta - horror movie @entity12
@entity14 produced and co-wrote the script for cabin with director @entity4 , a writer on @entity14 's " @entity18 " and a fanboy favorite in his own right , with credits that include @entity23 's " @entity22 " ( and reportedly may soon include @entity26 's upcoming @entity25 projects )
@entity9 and @entity4 are named as defendants , along with @entity28 and @entity14 's @entity30 production company , in the complaint filed monday in @entity33 federal court
@entity34 as " ' 70s - @entity35 " in the complaint , @entity36 ( no , not that @entity36 ) claims @entity9 and @entity4 took the idea for " @entity12 " from his 2006 novel " the @entity40 : @entity41
" he 's suing for copyright infringement and wants $ 10 million in damages
@entity36 is basing his claim on the works ' similar premises : both feature a group of young people terrorized by monsters while staying at a cabin in what is revealed to be ( spoiler alert ) a horror - film scenario designed by mysterious operators
@entity36 also alleges similarities between the characters ' names and personalities -- his book 's blond @entity64 and shy @entity65 and the film 's @entity66 ( @entity68 ) and @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , and handsome and scatterbrained men in both works -- and certain scenes involving the characters finding strange items in their respective cabins and discovering hidden cameras

" [ the defendants ] currently reside and operate out of @entity89 , @entity33 , a short distance from where the book was sold , " the lawsuit claims
@entity36 alleges that he " was contacted by multiple credited entertainment industry producers who expressed interest in the book , " but he does n't specify @entity28 or @entity30
