it 's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer , @entity7 , gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named @entity9 after a traffic stop in @entity11 , @entity12
and the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation -- along with the prompt arrest of @entity7 on murder charges -- is a welcome and appropriate response
but the event raises broad , troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of a third - party recording
it 's not supposed to be a mystery : more than 20 years ago , @entity31 approved a law , the @entity29 of 1994 , signed by president @entity30 , that requires the federal @entity33 to collect data on deaths caused by police
the law has never truly been implemented , leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in @entity43
" what happened here today does n't happen all the time
what if there was no video ? what if there was no witness -- or hero , as i call him -- to come forward ? " said @entity49 @entity48 , an attorney for @entity9 's family
" as you can see , the initial ( police ) reports stated something totally different
" that 's putting it mildly
in early police statements -- issued before the video came to light -- @entity7 reportedly said that @entity9 attacked him , that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive @entity9
the video makes hash of those claims , and likely contributed to @entity7 's swift arrest and pending murder charges
" when you 're wrong , you 're wrong , " said @entity11 mayor @entity71
that leaves @entity7 to face murder charges that could land him on death row -- and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality
i 'm all for having police use body cameras , although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force
but the much bigger problem is that we simply do n't know when and where police killings take place , or whether they cluster in particular cities or states
and that means we do n't know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias
we do n't even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness
these vital questions are n't supposed to be a mystery
according to @entity110 of the @entity111 , " the attorney general shall , through appropriate means , acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers
... the attorney general shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section
" that section of the law has effectively been ignored , beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in 1996
by 2001 , a @entity121 article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force , " no comprehensive accounting for all of the nation 's 17,000 police department exists
" there are multiple reasons the law has been ignored
collecting information from the nation 's thousands of jurisdictions -- the myriad villages , counties and cities -- is a tough , expensive assignment
the job is even harder because many police departments , reluctant to air their dirty laundry , fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it 's up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that 's often established only after years of court proceedings
these hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from @entity150 , but @entity31 has failed to press the @entity33 to demand the data and comply with the 1994 law
a weak substitute called the @entity154 in @entity155 was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014 , but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments
some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations -- and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular , mandatory enforcement of the data - gathering law
in 2011 , the @entity166 published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around @entity166 and found 378 shootings over a 20 - year period , 142 of which were fatal
in no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on - duty shooting
in @entity12 last month , @entity175 newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects , and found that only a handful of officers were charged , and none found guilty
" in @entity12 , it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone , " the @entity184 newspaper concluded
a group of activists has created a website called @entity191 that flags cases of police killings ; its estimate that at least 304 black people were killed by police in 2014 may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem
but we should n't be guessing
as the @entity166 editorialized in 2011 : " how many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings ? how can they know about a potential local problem without information ? ... police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder , and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute
the budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule
the social impact of such an addition , however , would be huge
" that common - sense observation is being echoed by the @entity225 administration -- specifically , the president 's @entity226 on @entity228 , created in december in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including @entity233 and @entity234
the recently released interim report of the task force calls , one more time , for the @entity33 to collect comprehensive data from local departments
but it will take more pressure -- from activists , victims ' families , members of @entity31 and president @entity225 himself -- to demand an end to the stonewalling of information
it 's long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like @entity9 's are happening without a video to set the record straight .
