after a weekend shipwreck off the coast of @entity3 that may have killed hundreds of migrants , the @entity0 said monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters
authorities still do n't know the fate of many of the passengers , including children , who were on the large ship bound from @entity16 to @entity17 that capsized saturday night in the frigid waters of the @entity19
that sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages
" gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat , sometimes even at gunpoint , " @entity28 prime minister @entity27 said
" they 're putting them on the road to death , really , and nothing else
" a rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from @entity16 , and the number of potential victims is not clear
a @entity45 survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board
previous estimates put the number around 700
@entity28 authorities , who are working with @entity3 rescuers , said around 50 people had been saved
but the @entity3 @entity56 said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered
two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in @entity62 , according to @entity3 police officer @entity63
on monday , @entity65 ministers met in @entity66 and proposed a 10 - point plan to help address the crisis
" we are not yet working on numbers , but what we have agreed on today is , for sure , the need to increase significantly the resources at sea , and the level of the operation , doing more search and rescue and doing it more together , " @entity69 told @entity5 's " @entity79 with @entity80
" the @entity65 high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the @entity65 must fight human traffickers , strengthen @entity17 ' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees
" we need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people , so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions , " @entity69 said
" my pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died
" migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the @entity19 to southern @entity17 for years , but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days , along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route
already this year , more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the @entity19 , far more than during the same period in 2014 , the @entity107 said last week
since the beginning of 2015 , more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the @entity19 -- 23,500 have landed in @entity3 and more than 12,000 in @entity112 , according to the @entity114 @entity113
while those numbers sound high , they were even higher the previous year
in 2014 , approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the @entity19 , with most having to be rescued by the @entity119 , @entity56 or merchant ships , the @entity116 said
it is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea
on monday , yet another boat sank off the @entity112 island of @entity127 , killing at least three people , the @entity112 @entity124 said
of the 83 people reported on board , at least 57 survived
those confirmed dead were a man , a woman and a child
the capsizing of the ship that departed from @entity16 marked the worst such disaster so far
as rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call saturday night , authorities say , migrants moved to one side , hoping to be saved
their movement caused the large , multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers ( 70 miles ) north of @entity16 , sending many passengers plunging into the sea
according to one @entity45 survivor , large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank
smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel , the survivor told @entity3 authorities
" our troops , together with the @entity3 navy , are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who 's still alive , " @entity27 said
while the shipwreck was an accident , @entity27 slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people 's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters
it 's " genocide -- nothing less than genocide , really , " @entity27 told @entity5
" a mass grave is being created in the @entity19 and @entity17 policies are responsible , " said @entity174 , the president of the international aid group @entity175
he compared the high number of deaths to " figures from a war zone
" @entity174 called on @entity17 states to immediately launch large - scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to @entity16 shores
" faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises , @entity17 has closed borders , forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea , " he said
" this tragedy is only just beginning , but it can and should be stopped
" @entity195 similarly called on @entity17 officials to do more
" what we needed from @entity65 foreign ministers today was life - saving action , but they dithered , " the group 's ceo @entity197 said in a statement
" with each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and @entity17 slips further into an immoral abyss
right now , people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics
" many of the migrants who board ships to cross the @entity19 come from @entity211 , often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships
they 're seeking a better life , but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages
" there is a well - oiled machine with the human traffickers , first by land and then by sea , and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to @entity17 at all costs , " said @entity218 - based journalist @entity217
the situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend is n't unusual , based on accounts of previous voyages
on old fishing boats , " people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship , " @entity232 said
" those are the cheaper tickets
people that want to be out on the upper deck , which is the prime space , pay a little more for that service
" traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ( $ 6,450 to $ 8,600 ) per person for the dangerous voyage , she said
@entity3 's proximity to the @entity251 coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent 's migration crisis
" we 're swamped , " @entity255 , the @entity3 minister for @entity17 affairs , told @entity258 daily @entity257
" there 's not even enough space in @entity62 's cemeteries to bury the dead
" an @entity3 search and rescue program , @entity265 , was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year
but it ended in october because of budget constraints and criticism from the @entity65 that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the @entity19
the @entity65 's border control agency , @entity274 , started its own mission in november , known as @entity276 , with a budget of less than a third of that of @entity265
@entity274 has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own , so has to rely on @entity17 member states to lend it ships
as anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent , @entity17 nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep
" we ca n't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one does n't happen , " @entity255 told @entity257 , lamenting " a total absence " of @entity65 policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in @entity17
the @entity298 , the executive branch of the @entity65 , said sunday it was consulting member states , @entity17 agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a @entity303 to be adopted in mid-may
" these are human lives at stake , and the @entity65 as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act , " it said
but international groups say @entity17 governments are failing to do enough
@entity175 will begin its own rescue effort , @entity174 said , because " as a medical , humanitarian organization , we simply can not wait any longer
" @entity5 's @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this report .
