it was a typical practice day for the @entity2 of rowing team , but then danger came from beneath
the scene was @entity6 outside of @entity7 early friday morning
the team 's boat got near the dock , when suddenly a swarm of @entity13 carp emerged from the water and went on the attack , some even going into the boat
team member @entity18 described the moment of terror : " the fish was flopping on my legs
it was so slippery that i could n't get a grip on it
" @entity18 screamed at teammate @entity26 , " @entity26 , get it off me ! " thankfully , no rowers were injured during the ordeal , but the strong smell of fish lingered in the moments afterward
