the victory of a 72 - year - old former general , @entity2 , in the @entity4 elections represents a moment of maturity in @entity8 politics
@entity2 , who some 30 years ago was @entity4 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self - described reformers have been
swath but the peaceful transition of power from president @entity14 to president @entity2 is the first of its kind in history
and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary @entity4 have finally had enough of the venality of their elites
for too long , @entity4 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth
the cancer of corruption has to be cut out
i visited @entity4 in january and found a country under siege
@entity31 , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand
soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire
it 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk
yet thanks to @entity4 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in @entity31
and when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know
graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24 - hour party palace at the @entity71
the richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime
for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of @entity14
but stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel
lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development
one was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run
the problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal
the problem of corruption went hand - in - glove with the rise of terrorism
@entity4 is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions
the south is dominated by @entity116 like @entity14 , the north by @entity118 like @entity2
and the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by @entity120 , which translates as " @entity122 education is forbidden
" westerners might assume that @entity120 's major target is the @entity126 south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist @entity118 as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on @entity132 population centers
failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to @entity120 's strategic ingenuity
previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror
in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in @entity31
few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full
and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped
the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in @entity4 as a consultant on a business visa )
what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed
and the @entity14 government might have benefited from the @entity120 terrorist emergency continuing in @entity118 centers , for the @entity118 were far more likely to vote for @entity2
for @entity2 to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in @entity126 areas -- and there , again , a @entity122 prejudice is challenged
the victory of a @entity118 candidate in @entity4 does not represent the victory of @entity175 , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the @entity118 world to govern itself
on the contrary , @entity2 is associated with an earlier period in @entity4 history when the army was relatively well paid and respected
he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure
but he also ran a @entity186 when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption
@entity2 was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it
now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of @entity120 and corruption
get the army functioning properly again , @entity4 hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists
@entity2 has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian
but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule
you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .
