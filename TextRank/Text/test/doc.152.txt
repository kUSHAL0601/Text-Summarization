fans of the late actor @entity2 knew that watching him in " @entity3 " would be bittersweet
even so , many moviegoers said the final scenes of the new film , which earned a record $ 146 million over the weekend , still packed an emotional wallop
" not gon na lie , i shed a few tears at the end of @entity3
the tribute to @entity2 was very well done , " one woman said monday on @entity12
@entity14 was just one of a flood of messages on social media from people who said they got choked up during scenes featuring @entity2 , who died at 40 in a car crash in november 2013 , before filming on " @entity22 " was completed
to finish @entity2 's scenes , the makers of the movie used body doubles , computer - generated images and even the actor 's brothers
but it was the ending that really got to moviegoers
in finishing " @entity34 7 , " the film 's producers sought to retire @entity2 's character , @entity35 , while paying homage to his role in the blockbuster " furious " action franchise
but they felt that killing him off might appear exploitative
" if they had gone down the other path , i think i would have refused to finish making this movie , " director @entity41 told @entity42
instead , the movie 's makers chose to " retire @entity2 's character in the most sincere and elegant way ( they ) could , " @entity41 said
their idea was to have @entity35 retire from his dangerous , high - octane lifestyle out of a sense of responsibility to his growing family with girlfriend @entity56 , who is pregnant with their second child
a scene late in the movie shows him and @entity56 playing on a beach with their son while the crew looks on -- essentially saying goodbye
then his longtime buddy @entity65 reminisces about their years together , leading to a montage of @entity2 scenes from the first six movies
the song that plays over the montage is " @entity75 , " a collaboration between @entity73 and @entity74
co-star @entity76 shared the video for the song late sunday on his @entity80 page , where it has more than 1.5 million likes
fans on @entity12 and @entity80 mostly praised the movie 's ending as a fitting tribute -- and an emotionally wrenching one
" man i do n't care how tough u are or how gangsta u claim to be
... the last five minutes had me choked up in the movie theater ... i saw it 3 times in one day ... ... the ending is the deepest ending i 've ever seen , " one man wrote on the movie 's @entity80 page .
