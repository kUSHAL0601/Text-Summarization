atop the @entity2 bestselling books list this month sat an unexpected title : " @entity4
" it was n't @entity7 's 1911 novel about a sour little girl 's magical place , making a book club comeback
it was a similarly named coloring book that adults were buying , for themselves , and it was n't the only one in the top 10
@entity14 's " @entity4 : an @entity15 & @entity16 " ( now at no. 3 on @entity2 ) along with her second effort , " @entity18 : an @entity19 " ( no. 6 ) ; " balance ( @entity21 's @entity20 1 ) " by @entity22 ( no. 9 ) ; and " the @entity23 : @entity25 " by @entity26 ( no. 8 on @entity2 ) are selling at a rapid clip
though they can be used by kids , these and other new coloring book titles are being marketed to stressed - out , work - addled adults , who want to benefit from the quiet zen that a coloring session can bring
" adult coloring is absolutely a growing trend and consumers are really taking to the idea , " @entity36 ' @entity35 publisher , @entity34 of @entity37 , wrote in an email
" not only is it calming and good for your health , it 's just fun ! the demand is increasing exponentially as the word spreads
" while @entity36 and @entity49 are based in the @entity50 , the concept is taking off in the @entity35 too , with the publication of titles like @entity54 - based art therapist @entity53 and illustrator @entity55 's " @entity56 " and " @entity57 , " created for the minds and motor skills of @entity60 , not the kids
the trend does n't seem to be letting up
@entity14 is working on a third title , @entity26 has been commissioned for a second book , and @entity53 and @entity65 will release " @entity66 " in september
adults have long used crafts to unwind , but why coloring books ? why now ? it may have something to do with online access -- and , funnily enough , the desire to unplug
ordering a coloring book that suits adult tastes online is easier than walking into a bookstore where the only options have @entity80 or @entity79 themes
plus , everyone 's favorite online crafting hub , @entity81 , is a treasure trove of adult coloring pages , with themes ranging from nature and animals to classic paintings
meanwhile , like children , adults need a break from screen time -- and many are rediscovering the analog pleasures of coloring inside the lines
" i 'm a grown - up , but i still love coloring books , " novelist @entity97 proclaimed in a piece for @entity99
" if i switch off the phone , computer and tv and concentrate solely on choosing the right shade of blue , avoiding going over the lines and slowly filling up my page with colour , all my other concerns , i 've discovered , fade to nothing , " @entity97 wrote
the therapeutic benefits of art are nothing new ; it 's a concept that practitioners use with patients of all ages
@entity119 - based art therapist @entity118 , who has published several coloring books , said coloring can lift the mood , reduce anxiety and relieve stress
" art making is a powerful intervention , " @entity118 wrote in an email
" @entity129 research has shown that through the use of art therapy , the human brain can physically change , grow , and rejuvenate
" true art therapy , she warned , should be administered only by a qualified professional
mindfulness and meditative coloring are recurring themes in the growing adult coloring book industry
a search for " adult coloring books " on @entity2 or @entity142 will yield several books of mandalas , a ritual symbol in @entity146 and @entity147 that represents the universe , waiting to be colored in
" i sometimes give clients one of my mandala coloring books for homework between sessions with me , " @entity118 wrote
" coloring mandalas can empower a client to manage thoughts and feelings on their own with the positive activity of coloring , instead of , for example , overeating or abusing substances
" the opportunity to craft a mindfulness coloring book for adults was serendipitous for illustrator @entity36 , who had been practicing mindfulness for a few years before getting the offer to create a book
" in mindfulness , it is encouraged to break patterns in life by introducing variation to avoid the sensation of being on autopilot , " @entity36 wrote in an email while on holiday in @entity171
" each page has been caringly designed with this in mind , so that the person coloring can hop at random from one pattern to the next
" coloring books like @entity36 ' pocket - sized volume bring a bit of calming and spirituality to the masses , but for some adult enthusiasts coloring is just a fun throwback to a simpler time , she added
" it reminds me of hours spent filling in scenes from a coloring book as a little girl
in the digital age that we are in , surely , it can only be a good thing to pick up a pencil and feel young again
