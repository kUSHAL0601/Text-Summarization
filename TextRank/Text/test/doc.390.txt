@entity0 , @entity1 [ breaking news update at 11:45 p.m. et ] two african - americans -- @entity5 and @entity6 -- were elected to the @entity7 on tuesday , meaning three of the six council members are black
[ previous story , published at 6:52 p.m. et ] the skies grew ominous and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods
amid the rain , @entity0 opened its polls at 6 a.m. for municipal elections that traditionally have drawn very few out to vote
this was the first city election since white police officer @entity20 shot and killed unarmed black teenager @entity21 last august
since then , this @entity23 suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against african - americans by law enforcement and the courts
there 's widespread feeling , especially in the @entity35 - @entity34 community , that if the turnout is low , then all the protests , the investigations , the calls for change will have been in vain
@entity23 elections officials said they had no indication that turnout in tuesday 's election would be any different than other years
but among the candidates inspired to run by the events that transpired here , there was hope of seeing greater voter participation
" that is what our democracy is about , " said @entity6 , a 40 - year - old lawyer and criminal justice professor who also is a part - time municipal judge in nearby @entity52
@entity6 is running against @entity57 , a retired electrical plant employee , in @entity58
that area includes @entity60 , where @entity21 was killed , and the @entity62 business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism
charred , heavily damaged buildings stand as scars of @entity0 's despair and anger
both @entity6 and @entity57 are black , and no matter the outcome , one of them will double the @entity35 - @entity34 representation on the council
even though 70 % of @entity0 's 21,000 people are black , five of the six current @entity7 members and the mayor are white
the council was cited along with the @entity80 , which has three black officers , as a symbol of white power in a majority black city
" we have to get out of this law enforcement for business , " said candidate @entity85 , coordinator of the computer network security program at @entity87
@entity85 referred to the scathing report by the @entity34 @entity92 that found @entity0 issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city
" that 's not a good thing , " @entity85 said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided
the polls close here at 7 p.m. results are not expected until a few hours later
@entity104 , a 67 - year - old retired airline pilot , said he voted for @entity105 , a former mayor who launched the " @entity107 " campaign last fall to raise money for mom and pop businesses that were hurt by the looting and vandalism
some residents see @entity105 as being a part of the establishment , part of the problem
but @entity104 asked why no one complained when @entity105 was mayor
he said @entity21 's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light
" we did n't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people , " he said
" some things need to be changed and we are aware of that
" by midafternoon , @entity105 said the numbers looked good
at a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots , he predicted a 40 - 50 % turnout
when the rain let up for a few minutes , a stream of voters trickled into the @entity140 in downtown @entity0 to cast their votes
@entity142 and @entity143 both voted for @entity144 , a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines
he speaks often of having married a black woman and having a biracial teenage son
" i wanted change , " said @entity153 , 60 , who is black
he said the couple moved to @entity0 after he retired from the @entity157 in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place
but now , after all the problems rose to the surface , it 's time for fresh blood on the @entity7 , @entity153 said
that 's why they chose @entity144 over @entity105
" quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream , " he said
" that 's like using the military to go into places and looting them
the police are supposed to keep order
" @entity172 came to the polls with her husband and two little girls in tow
she voted for @entity5 , a former @entity178 cosmetics sales director who resigned her job in january to run for office
@entity181 echoed the thoughts of other @entity0 residents who experienced something new in this election : candidates coming to their door
past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks
" one thing we really liked is ( @entity194 ) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood , " @entity181 said
" she 's going to be hands on
she lives in the neighborhood as well , and has for the past 36 years
we were kind of taken by that
" @entity105 , the former mayor turned @entity7 candidate , campaigned that @entity0 would benefit from his experience more than a newcomer , saying his contacts from almost three decades in politics would be an invaluable asset in getting @entity0 back on its feet
" i understand that feeling , " @entity105 said of those who feel he 's too entrenched in the city 's old guard , " but those individuals do n't know me
" the city is required to approve a new budget by the end of june and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $ 3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines
" that amount will drop significantly , " @entity105 said
the rain began to fall again as the @entity229 got in their car
it was expected to continue off and on through the day and night
but about 5 , just when many voters were leaving work , the sun shone brilliantly
overheard at one precinct : good weather brought out the worst in @entity0 last august
maybe today , it would bring out the best .
