the audience gasped , cheered and applauded
the cast was appreciative of the welcome
" you 're more than fans
you 're family , " @entity21 told the crowd

they 're " retired , " she said
airline unveils ' @entity8 ' @entity32 painted like @entity33 also introduced : " @entity8 " emoji , some new @entity34 and the @entity35 , the soccer - ball - like droid that rolled around the stage , to the delight of the audience
it was n't @entity42 , either , as much of the movie , @entity7 said , was filmed on actual sets
@entity45 erupted with near - instantaneous reaction , most of it enthusiastic
@entity49 : ' @entity8 ' teaser sends @entity45 into lightspeed the new " @entity8 " is due out december 18
@entity1 's @entity52 was in the audience
here are his five top takeaways from the event : 1
@entity56 flies again the trailer ended in a big way , with @entity59 and @entity60 having apparently arrived after a flight on the @entity62
the reaction in the room of fans was nothing short of rapturous upon seeing @entity67 back in character as @entity56
a few burst into tears at the end of the the 110 - second teaser
that 's not @entity74 @entity7 revealed that their shooting location was not meant to represent the @entity78 ancestral home of @entity74 , as many believed
instead , it 's a planet called @entity80 , where much of the early action of the movie takes place
@entity86 's @entity85 meets up with a stromtrooper , @entity89 ( @entity88 ) and that 's where the adventure begins
hints of @entity94 and @entity28 @entity95 dropped a major hint that his pilot character of @entity98 is sent on a mission by " a princess , " and we 're fairly certain which one he meant
@entity28 and @entity94 are n't seen in the trailer , but we hear @entity94 's unmistakable voice as he passes along a lightsaber , presumably to other @entity78 family members
@entity25 also teased her new wardrobe , and promised no metal bikini
there 's less cgi than in the prequels @entity7 said he was proud that " you can watch the movie and see what it is " before the effects wizards at @entity116 did their work
and yes , the new droid @entity118 ( who was a fan favorite at the panel ) is not @entity42
the ruins of the @entity122 are all around a crashed @entity123 can be seen at the opening of the trailer , as well as a look at @entity128 's charred helmet
creating the sounds of ' @entity8 ' @entity1 's @entity52 contributed to this story .
