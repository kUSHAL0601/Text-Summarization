it 's clear from @entity3 's campaign rollout -- a video announcement / campaign ad / short film that debuted sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach
in case you 're skeptical , @entity8 has posted a handy " by the numbers " for her campaign video , and there are 38 people besides @entity14 in the two - minute ad
twenty of them are women
there are three separate mentions of motherhood
this is all fine and good ( and predictable ) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980
and let 's not overlook the fact that @entity14 is in fact a woman , and that 's a fine thing to celebrate
but in reality , she does n't have to wonder if a woman - centered campaign is the best strategy
she can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible - voting population failed spectacularly all over the country , in red and blue states , when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates
as i 've previously written , the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme : the " war on women
" granted , that 's not because @entity50 convinced the country that they were the party of women
but it is noteworthy that @entity55 who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues ( and men ) crashed and burned
to wit : in @entity62 , sen. @entity61 was nicknamed " @entity68 " for all the time he spent fear - mongering on women 's reproductive issues , only to end up , according to exit polls , eight points ahead among women
his opponent , @entity69 , finished 17 points ahead among men
in @entity72 , a @entity55 candidate for @entity74 , @entity75 , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a " war on women
" to repeat , she was a woman , a @entity82 , in @entity72
in @entity84 , sen. @entity83 sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for @entity55 ' lack of popularity in the @entity91
not surprisingly , @entity91 voted for her opponent , @entity92
in @entity93 , where liberal @entity94 ran almost entirely on an abortion - rights platform , she accused @entity50 of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography
her opponent , @entity99 , won by 20 points , and @entity101 only ended up with 47 % of the women vote
whether in @entity93 or @entity62 , @entity72 or @entity84 , voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and were n't going to be bullied into voting @entity55 by false cries of sexism
but while @entity55 were screaming about the @entity50 ' " war on women , " few in the media acknowledged that the @entity55 ' deficit among men was actually greater than the @entity50 ' deficit among women
exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for @entity50 over @entity55 by a 16 - point margin , and women voted for @entity55 by only a four - point margin
regardless of whom @entity50 run for president , @entity3 will most likely get the women vote
what she needs are men
so instead of running a woman - centered campaign , she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex .
