@entity1 , @entity2 it did n't look like much , but we 'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between @entity9 and @entity1
better , everyone advised , to be low key , even if low key meant faded lights and three water pumps chugging at all times
the wooden vessel was called @entity17 â€” after the holy city
we were told we 'd be at the port in @entity1 by the next morning , but as the hours ticked by it soon became apparent that that was wildly optimistic
@entity22 came and we were still only halfway there
we 'd been given a secure route , charted for us by the @entity25
it meant hugging the coastline , trying to stay as much as possible out of the deeper water in the middle of the @entity30 where the world 's navies seemed to be squaring off
it was almost double the distance of the direct route
add to that a strong current -- and stomach - churning seas -- and it felt like we would spend an eternity on board
after our second sunset , we were finally close enough for my phone to ping with a @entity2 welcome message
however , we could n't risk arriving at night ; even getting too close to shore would risk being mistaken for a re-supply vessel and potentially taking a @entity47 hit
the captain slowed the boat to a crawl so the remaining miles would stretch until daybreak
it was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of @entity1
we were n't really sure what to expect but we did know we could n't stay for long
from the moment we stepped through the gates of the port , we were met by noise and desperation , shoving and shouting
" where are you going ? " " i 'll pay , i 'll pay " " are you here to take the @entity65 ? " i shouted back that we 'd return soon
we had just five hours on the ground and we needed to visit the hospital , the shuttered markets , the frontlines
there was so much we needed to see
the crowds clustered around our camera lens , asking " why ? " " why is this happening ? " " why has n't it stopped ? " it felt like no time had passed before we were told we had to go
we 'd been hearing pops of sniper fire all day but now we could hear rounds of automatic weapons and they were getting louder
as we arrived back at port , we found we were n't leaving alone
after waiting at port , praying a passing ship would dock , ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting
the @entity90 asked if we could take 60 refugees
it did n't feel like the answer could be anything but yes
what we did n't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $ 300 a person : an " exit fee
" those who did n't have the money were pushed back behind the wrought iron gates of the port
those that did shared our day - and - a - half trip home
as the shores of @entity9 grew closer , you could see the uncertainty begin to take over
many of them had come from comfortable lives , before the war shattered them
they had left homes that once hummed with air conditioners and televisions
would the camps have @entity120 , they asked
no , they would n't , i said
what i did n't say was that they 'd be lucky to have electricity
but woven amid the uncertainty was the relief of escape
some of the refugees took over our ship 's galley -- the kitchen
they 'd found a former chef amongst their number who commandeered the store cupboard , sending out a pick and mix of heaped trays
we got tuna spaghetti and more @entity145 coffee than our cameraman @entity146 could possibly drink
because we 'd brought refugees back with us , we were asked by the @entity148 to dock in the country 's north , in @entity151 , so they could be given the proper status while they wait to see what happens back home
the immigration officials were -- understandably -- a little bemused by our presence amongst a boatload of people fleeing @entity2 , but to their credit they decided the important thing was that these families were now safe
from there @entity162 was just a few hours away , hours that stretched into infinity for the families ringing my phone to check that their loved ones had made it into harbor
over the last few hours , people had shyly come up to ask if they could borrow our phone to tell their families they were safe
now a deluge of anxious parents , siblings and partners flooded my ear , asking how it could possibly be that we were n't yet on dry land
but eventually we were , and as we watched the @entity183 officials unload what remained of people 's belongings onto shore , it was a reminder that these were the lucky ones
thousands more are still waiting back in @entity2 , hoping they too will reach a safe port .
