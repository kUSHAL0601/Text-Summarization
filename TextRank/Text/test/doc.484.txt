@entity2 , @entity0 @entity0 froze dozens of accounts linked to suspected terror supporters after militants massacred 147 people last week at a university in @entity8
the government is tracking the finances of people suspected of ties to @entity13 , the militant group that claimed responsibility for the thursday attack
so far , the government has frozen 86 accounts , but that number could go up , said @entity19 , a spokesman for the @entity20
the government has tracked supporters of the terror group since 2011 , and efforts to freeze their assets have gone on since then
it has a list of suspects from various parts of the country , but mostly in @entity2 and @entity32 , he said
@entity0 mourned the victims of the attack tuesday night at @entity2 's @entity35 , where hundreds gathered
organizers unloaded 147 crosses , some draped with the nation 's flag , as candles flickered in the dark
of the fatalities , 142 were students at the university , and the rest were security forces and campus security
" i ca n't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying , " said @entity50 , 32 , who lives in @entity51 , hundreds of miles from @entity8
" they were just children
they were trying to make a better life for themselves
some were first to go to college in their communities
they died trying to get an education
" using the hashtag # 147notjustanumber , @entity0 used social media to talk about the lives of the victims
they shared pictures of beaming faces , full of life and energy , in happier days
they talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children 's bodies
some students remain unaccounted for , and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues
@entity0 authorities have not released the names of the victims
@entity0 authorities had prior intelligence that a university in @entity8 could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in @entity2 for hours after the massacre awaiting transport , a police source said monday
the frozen accounts is the latest in a series of actions as the government faced heavy criticism for the siege , which lasted hours
a spokesman for president @entity97 said authorities " got the job done " and saved lives
the university had about 800 students
" with the benefit of hindsight , you can always say things could have been done better , " @entity102 said
@entity0 also launched airstrikes monday targeting @entity13 's training camps in @entity109 , according to a military source , who said they were not retaliation for last week 's massacre
" the latest attack of @entity13 bases by the @entity0 military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011 , " the source said monday
@entity0 has also offered 20 million @entity0 shillings , or about $ 215,000 , for information on the whereabouts of @entity122 , who allegedly organized the attack
@entity126 is a senior @entity13 leader known by the aliases @entity128 and @entity129 , authorities said
@entity13 is based in @entity109 , and its violence has spread to @entity0 before
in 2013 , militants attacked @entity2 's upscale @entity132 , leaving 67 people dead
the terror group has intensified attacks in @entity0 since the country sent troops to @entity109 four years ago to help battle the militants
@entity1 's @entity139 reported from @entity2 , and @entity140 reported and wrote from @entity141 .
