" it 's showtime ! " @entity2 paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in " @entity5 " and " @entity6 " in his third turn hosting " @entity8 " this weekend
@entity2 acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982
" i had a baby -- he 's 31
i also have a new girlfriend -- she 's 28 , " he said
fans who were hoping for a full - blown revival of @entity2 's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed
@entity8 cast members @entity17 and @entity19 begged the actor with a song to " play " @entity6 and beetlejuice with them
all they got in response were a couple of one - liners
overall , @entity2 's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its " deadpan " manner and " unpredictable weirdness , " in the words of @entity36 's @entity35
fans also delighted in a cameo from " @entity39 " star @entity40 during @entity41
@entity2 scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who 's not very good at his job , a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy " she 's all that
" other crowd - pleasing spots included a @entity56 parody music video and a news conference spoofing the @entity59 student - athlete debate
the show also poked fun at @entity1 with cast member @entity62 playing anchor @entity63
@entity63 said on @entity64 that she 's taking it as a " crazy compliment " and shared a clip from the skit .
