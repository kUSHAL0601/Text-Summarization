this is week three of an ongoing series : a @entity2
read week one and week two
when i started this project , my brother texted me , " wait until you get to @entity7
" by sunday afternoon , i understood what he meant
i am horrified by the story of @entity7 in @entity10
lot and the destruction of @entity13 was new to me
i actually had n't put two and two together that @entity13 is the origin of the word sodomy
( feel free to call me dense as you read this )
@entity7 is the central character in the grim story of @entity13 's demise in @entity22
you are introduced to the city by @entity24 who tries to save the town
in the preceding chapter , @entity24 asks @entity28 to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town , @entity28 wo n't smite it
@entity7 is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town
the men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for " intimacies
hospitable bunch , huh ? those " intimacies , " we are meant to understand , account for @entity13 's wickedness
and i guess meant that the town was doomed
( " intimacies " is the term used in my 1991 edition of the @entity45
the revised edition refers to " sexual relations
" ) to protect the emissaries from the mob , @entity7 offers up his virginal daughters
anyway , it does n't work
there apparently are n't enough good men to save @entity13 , which leads to @entity28 destroying yet another population in @entity10
oh , and while @entity7 's chosen family members flee the destruction , @entity56 turns around and is turned to salt
she had been warned not to look back
after @entity28 destroys @entity13 , @entity7 's daughters worry that there are n't any men left , so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him
they need to have children to keep the human race going , the logic goes , i guess
after reading that section , i put my @entity45 down
i could n't read anymore
then i read it again
what was i reading ? what are the morals , the meaning , i 'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories ? this is not the @entity28 that i have known for nearly 42 years
it 's not the version of the @entity28 i pray to daily
i truly do n't believe in a @entity28 that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality
why are they wicked ? i do n't believe that my @entity28 that would go after one group -- any group
the @entity28 that i pray to does n't punish the " wicked " like this
i ca n't comprehend this version of @entity28
i ca n't believe in that kind of @entity28
there were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that i read
but , i want to be truthful with you , my readers
the @entity7 story struck me -- hard
i wish that i had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago
it could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children
or it could be a morality tale for the times
the truth is : i do n't really know
i just know that my faith does n't include the idea of such a punitive @entity28
i now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the @entity45
and when i read this rough draft to my brother , he said to me , " you have just hit the tip of the iceberg
" so , i will continue reading .
