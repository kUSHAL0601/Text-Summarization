@entity1 activists have climbed aboard a @entity4 oil rig to protest the company 's plans to drill in the @entity7 near @entity8
the six protesters used ropes and harnesses monday to scale the huge platform in the @entity12 , tweeting images of their daunting climb as they went
" we made it ! we 're on @entity4 's platform
and we 're not alone , " wrote @entity17 , an @entity18 activist taking part in the protest
" everyone can help turn this into a platform for people power ! " the rig , the @entity26 , is on its way to the @entity7 via @entity28
the environmental activists caught up with it about 750 miles northwest of @entity30 , @entity1 said
they plan to occupy the underside of the rig 's main deck and say they have enough supplies to stay there for several days
@entity4 did n't immediately respond to @entity2 's request for comment late monday
but company spokeswoman @entity39 told @entity40 that the boarding was illegal and jeopardized the safety of the activists and the crew
@entity1 is furious over a decision last week by @entity18 authorities to lift the suspensions on leases to drill for oil and gas in the @entity51 , which lies between northern @entity8 and @entity52
@entity4 and several other oil companies bought exploration leases for the sea in 2008
the @entity18 government 's decision " means that in 100 days , @entity4 could begin drilling in the @entity8 @entity7 , " @entity1 said
federal agencies still have to review and approve companies ' plans before exploratory drilling can start
@entity4 's work in the @entity7 has suffered some setbacks in the past , including a drilling barge that ran aground off southern @entity8 on december 31 , 2012
@entity1 has repeatedly used the occupation of drilling - related vessels to bring attention to its cause
one group of its activists was detained for months by @entity52 authorities in 2013
in the current episode , the activists pursued the @entity26 , which @entity4 is leasing from @entity76 , as it traveled thousands of miles aboard a transport vessel from @entity78 , @entity1 said
besides the @entity18 protester field , the activists come from @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85
the @entity86 was n't immediately available for comment late monday on the incident
@entity2 's @entity89 contributed to this report .
