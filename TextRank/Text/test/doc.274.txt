it 's one of the most famous faces in history , even though no one really knows what he looked like
instead , every culture , every generation , remakes @entity8 in its own image
a blonde - haired , blue - eyed savior when @entity12 was mostly @entity13 , at least in @entity15 's eyes
an androgynous , meek - and - mild messiah during the anything - goes 1970s
a studly action - figure hero after the attacks of september 11 , 2001
flip through the gallery above , and you 'll see what i mean
if you turned on the television this past sunday , though , a new vision of @entity8 came into view
@entity28 , in mood and skin tone
if not following all of history 's clues -- @entity15 has yet to cast an actual @entity33 as @entity8 -- then at least inching closer
flipping through the channels on a day millions of @entity38 celebrated the resurrection of their savior , viewers could choose from " @entity41 , " a @entity35 production rebroadcast sunday on @entity42
" @entity51 , " @entity44 's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries " @entity46 , " and " finding @entity8 , " @entity1 's addition to the ever - burgeoning body of @entity50 - centered tv fare
does @entity52 have a prayer in @entity15 ? what unites these disparate projects , besides a recognition that @entity8 always draws an audience and the good book is good for business , is the type of men chosen to play @entity50
they are brawny , with brown eyes and dark complexions
they look like men who could be carpenters , if not in @entity67 , than at least in the @entity69 neighborhood
@entity70 , from " @entity41 , " was born and raised in @entity71
he 's also @entity72 , a fact that annoyed some @entity38 , who took to @entity74 to voice their displeasure
@entity76 , a @entity77 actor of mixed heritage , including @entity79 , portrays @entity8 during the historical reenactments in " finding @entity8
" and @entity81 -- a @entity82 named after the @entity83 -- takes a starring role in " @entity51 , " replacing @entity85 , dubbed " hot @entity8 , " by some , " smarmy @entity8 " by others
you could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm , and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible
contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels - and - sandals epics of eras past
but there 's another , deeper meaning behind our new , multicultural jesuses , scholars say
" filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of @entity12 has changed , " said @entity106 , a religion scholar and author of " @entity108 : @entity15 's making of the @entity12 @entity50
" " a large number of @entity12 are people of color : latinos and @entity119 and people from @entity121 , " @entity117 continued
" that means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways
" the audience base may be shifting , but it 's also tuning in
each of the @entity8 shows drew big ratings , which means you 'll likely be seeing more of @entity50 as you channel surf
but according to the @entity132 , almost every depiction of @entity8 so far has gotten at least one detail wrong : his flowing locks
real men do n't wear long hair , said the @entity138 scribe .
