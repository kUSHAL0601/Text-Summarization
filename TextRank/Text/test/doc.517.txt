it 's a hard - knock life , @entity2 , especially on @entity3
the uber private rapper / entrepreneur broke out of his usually reserved social media shell over the weekend to defend the performance of his new music streaming service , @entity10
using the hashtag # @entity12 , he attempted to refute talk that the company has been doing a less than stellar job in taking on competitor @entity17
he launched the subscription - based music service last month with a star - studded news conference in which artists such as @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity2 's wife , @entity25 , came together in support of what singer @entity27 told the crowd was " the first ever artist - owned global music and entertainment platform
" @entity31 : @entity2 's tidal music service to be owned by artists but less than a month after its debut , there 's been chatter that the service is underwhelming , and @entity2 's " stream of consciousness " tweets denying that were met with some derision
and , of course , a tidal facts parody @entity3 account was quickly created to offer some " facts " of its own .
