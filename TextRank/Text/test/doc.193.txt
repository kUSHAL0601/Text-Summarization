a 32 - year - old @entity3 man is facing murder charges , authorities said wednesday , four days after another man 's remains were found in a duffel bag
the @entity10 district attorney 's @entity8 said that @entity11 , 32 , will be arraigned the morning of april 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered saturday in @entity15
earlier this week , @entity11 was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body
a @entity10 judge then revoked bail for @entity11 in another case he 's involved in , for alleged assault and battery
the victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days
police were notified saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in @entity15
officers arrived at the scene , opened a duffel bag and found human remains
after that discovery , police say , a surveillance video led them to an apartment building , where more body parts were discovered in a common area
that location is near the @entity45 headquarters
the remains at both locations belonged to the same victim , identified monday as @entity49 , 26
@entity49 and @entity11 knew each other , according to authorities
" this was a gruesome discovery , " district attorney @entity52 said
@entity1 's @entity55 contributed to this report .
