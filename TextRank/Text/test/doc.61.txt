@entity1 , @entity2 on march 20 , 2013 , a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in @entity2
then more ominously on december 23 last year , computers at the country 's nuclear operator were breached
the source of these attacks ? @entity13
and @entity2 investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks
they shared this data with @entity3
the 2013 attack , known as " @entity20 , " paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters , disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean
" it would try to delete essentially all your files ... then restart the system
you would come back up and nothing would be there , " @entity31 , a digital forensic expert , told @entity3
" if it infected more financial systems , it could have deleted all financial data in @entity2
i mean , it is dangerous , " the visiting professor at @entity41 's @entity40 added
live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down , while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals , or transfer money online
" @entity20 " happened shortly after the @entity13 government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three - year @entity52 to an end in july 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor
the latest high - profile digital incursion , in december , attempted to steal data from @entity2 's nuclear operator , including plant blueprints and personnel information
though investigators said no critical data was stolen , the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs
the attack itself was described by @entity31 as a " spear - fishing " exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email
" as soon as you double click on it , it starts running in the background of your computer where you ca n't see ... it 's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker , " he told @entity3
the attack , which @entity31 said was simpler than " @entity20 , " came just a few days after @entity91 said their systems has been " hacked , " another attack the @entity2 authorities blamed on @entity13
" from a law enforcement or investigation side , we 're trying to actually trace back to who did it , " said @entity31
@entity1 announced in mid-march that some of the ip addresses used in december incursion could be traced back to @entity102 , @entity103 , which can be easily accessed from the @entity13 border
codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the @entity13 , @entity2 authorities said
" the malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as " @entity122 " codes known to be used by @entity13 , " the prosecutor 's office that leads 17 other government agencies and @entity114 companies in the investigation said in the statement in march
@entity123 has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks , calling them a " plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth
" but many experts say @entity13 appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival
indeed @entity2 's @entity134 estimates that @entity13 is operating a " cyberarmy " of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability
" hacks are going on all the time , constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount , " said @entity31
" how many are detected in general ? i think the average person would have no clue they 've been hacked
" organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they 're not , " he added
many in @entity2 believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks
a report by the @entity154 and @entity155 , a government - funded think tank , estimates that " @entity20 " caused about $ 820 million worth of damage
its report , published in 2014 , predicted that by 2020 , @entity2 could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $ 25 billion in economic damage .
