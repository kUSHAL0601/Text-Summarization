a top @entity3 leader -- who a few years ago was in a @entity6 detention facility -- was among five killed in an airstrike in @entity8 , the terror group said , showing the organization is vulnerable even as @entity8 appears close to civil war
@entity11 died monday night in what @entity3 's media wing , @entity12 , called a " crusader airstrike
" the @entity12 obituary characterized @entity16 as a religious scholar and combat commander
a @entity8 @entity20 official and two @entity8 national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that @entity11 had been killed , but could not specify how he died
@entity23 was once held by the @entity6 government at its detention facility in @entity26 , @entity27
in fact , he was among a number of detainees who sued the administration of then - president @entity33 to challenge the legality of their confinement in @entity36
he was eventually released as part of @entity39 's program for rehabilitating jihadist terrorists , a program that @entity6 sen. @entity42 , @entity43 , characterized as " a failure
" in december 2009 , @entity42 listed @entity16 among those on the virtual " ' @entity46 ' of @entity3 terrorists on the @entity48 ... who have either graduated or escaped from the program en route to terrorist acts
" the @entity6 has been active in @entity8 , working closely with governments there to go after @entity3 leaders like @entity16
while it was not immediately clear how he died , drone strikes have killed many other members of the terrorist group
@entity8 , however , has been in disarray since @entity61 rebels began asserting themselves last year
the @entity63 minority group even managed to take over the capital of @entity65 and , in january , force out @entity8 president @entity66 -- who had been a close @entity6 ally in its anti-terror fight
@entity66 still claims he is @entity8 's legitimate leader , and he is working with a @entity39 - led military coalition to target @entity61 and supporters of former president @entity70
meanwhile , @entity8 has been awash in violence and chaos -- which in some ways has been good for groups such as @entity3
a prison break earlier this month freed 270 prisoners , including some senior @entity3 figures , according to a senior @entity20 official , and the @entity6 pulled the last of its special operations forces out of @entity8 last month , which some say makes things easier for @entity3
@entity1 's @entity82 and @entity83 contributed to this report .
