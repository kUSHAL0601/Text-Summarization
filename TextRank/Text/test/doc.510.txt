@entity7 's " @entity6 " continues to build momentum at the friday box office for a weekend debut in the $ 135 million - $ 138 million range , the largest opening in @entity5 since fall 2013
that includes a projected friday take of $ 58 million - $ 60 million
the final film featuring the late @entity11 , " @entity6 " is opening around the globe this weekend and earned a record - breaking $ 60 million internationally on wednesday and thursday for a possible worldwide debut approaching or crossing $ 300 million by the end of @entity15
" @entity18 " is getting the widest release in @entity7 's history
domestically , it will be playing in 4,003 theaters by @entity21
internationally , it has booked more than 10,500 screens in 63 territories , although it wo n't open in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 until later
the current record - holder for top april opening domestically is " @entity30 : the winter soldier , " which debuted to $ 95 million from 3,928 theaters last year
" @entity6 " is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date
and it will easily beat the $ 121.9 million launch of " @entity36 — part 1 " in november 2104 , making it the largest three - day opening since " @entity36 : catching @entity38 " ( $ 158 million ) in november 2013
the movie enjoys massive awareness and interest , due to both the popularity of the street - racing series and @entity11 's death
the last film , " @entity45 , " debuted to a franchise - best $ 117 million over the four - day @entity47 weekend in 2012 , including $ 97.4 million for the three days , on its way to grossing $ 788.7 million worldwide
@entity7 intended to open " @entity18 " on july 11 , 2014 , but production was halted in november 2013 when @entity11 died in a car crash during the @entity52 hiatus
after director @entity55 , writer @entity54 and @entity7 pored over existing footage and tweaked the script , production resumed in april 2014
@entity59 and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring @entity11 's detective character , @entity61 , with @entity11 's brothers , @entity63 and @entity64 , used as stand - ins
" @entity6 " pits @entity67 's @entity66 and crew ( which includes @entity70 and @entity71 , among others , as well as @entity11 ) against @entity74 's @entity73 , out for revenge after the death of his brother
@entity78 also reprises his role as @entity80
