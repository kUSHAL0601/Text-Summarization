thousands of @entity2 and @entity3 refugees trapped in the @entity5 refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities
but while the story is in itself tragic , it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling
i encountered two such individuals on my mission to @entity18 -- @entity20 and @entity21 -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from @entity5 in recent days , a place that was described last week by the @entity25 @entity24 ban ki - moon as " the deepest circle of hell
" the fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children
looking into those bright young faces , touching their pristine hands , the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me
like the wider @entity2 conflict , @entity5 has a human face ; the faces of young @entity21 and young @entity20
i want to introduce you to them in the hope that you , too , will understand why i am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in @entity2
@entity47 , the youngest @entity3 refugee to flee @entity5 , was born on march 30
his mother , @entity49 , never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough
" i was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy , but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items , " she said
@entity49 was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day
@entity21 was born in @entity5 on january 25 of this year
when @entity61 -- @entity61 -- entered the camp and tensions heightened , his mother , @entity64 , fled in search of safety
her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son
yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future
she hopes that if and when life returns to normal , she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in @entity5
these tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all
when i next brief the @entity84 , as i did a few days ago , i will tell them about @entity20 and @entity21
i will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside @entity5 , other civilians who need help where they are
to do this , hostilities will have to subside
pressure must be exerted on armed actors in @entity5 to this end
beyond that , those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely
these things are all possible
but it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more , nothing less
@entity5 must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold
because to abandon such belief would be to abandon @entity20 , @entity21 and thousands of other civilians like them
and that is simply not an option .
