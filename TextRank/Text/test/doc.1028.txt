he might have just won one of sport 's most prestigious events , but it was n't long before @entity7 's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory
the 21 - year - old golfer equaled @entity14 ' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on sunday as he swept through the field to become @entity19 champion at @entity20
an ice - cool display made him the second - youngest winner -- behind only @entity23 , who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament 's four days
" i miss her a lot , and i wish she could have been here , " @entity7 told @entity1 's @entity27 in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling @entity30 , who was not able to attend the tournament
" but i ca n't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket
" i 'll have to bring her back a present from here
that 's what she 'll be expecting
" amid all the pressure of playing professional golf , @entity7 's 14 - year - old sister provides him with perspective
" how has she shaped my upbringing ? well , she 's the most special part of our family
she 's the funniest part of our family , " he said
" i love having her around
she 's an incredible sister , my biggest supporter
she is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day , or in a round of golf , are really secondary
" we would n't have that realization without her
" at the age of just 14 , the prodigy from @entity64 -- who was named after basketball legend @entity65 -- had been clear about what he wanted : his aim was to take the @entity19 title one day
and he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance , letting slip only a muttered " oh dear " when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round
last year , @entity7 lost the lead just before the nine - hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time , beating @entity79 's masters record of 26 birdies for good measure
" to sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of @entity87 and the @entity19 was something i watched slip away last year , " said @entity7 , who described the reality of winning as " even better " than his dreams
" i had a chip on my shoulder ( about that )
i carried some momentum into this week and it all came together , right at the right time
" shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport , @entity7 , born in @entity93 , added : " putting on the jacket , it looks good
i 'm ok wearing green ! " he could n't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final @entity19 appearance in 50 years ' time , but added that he would " still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today
" and as he looked less far ahead , he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year 's @entity110
asked what he would put on the menu for that event , he said : " it would be some form of @entity116
" the unassuming @entity7 's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self - belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers
in 1985 , @entity125 tennis player @entity124 stunned @entity126 when , at the age of 17 , he defeated @entity128 to become the event 's youngest ever men 's champion -- a record that still stands today
@entity124 said people " thought i had done something i was n't supposed to do , something that should n't have been possible
but i did it -- and then i did it again at 18 , just to make the point
" @entity139 player @entity138 was 118 days younger than @entity124 when he won the @entity140 in 1989 , while @entity142 star @entity141 was just 16 when she triumphed at the @entity143
last year , at the age of only 15 , @entity144 became @entity147 's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the @entity149 , provoking huge media interest and the attention of @entity153 's top clubs , before he signed for @entity155 giant @entity154
for them , as for @entity7 , perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days
and as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand , taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents ' home in @entity164 , he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket , referring to another @entity168 winner
" how about the focus on that swing ? " he asked
" that 's a little @entity172 - like there , is n't it ? "
