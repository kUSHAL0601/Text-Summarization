film critic @entity0 , whose populist passion for all genres of movies illuminated @entity6 's coverage of cinema for 35 years , died thursday night in @entity8
@entity0 died a week after suffering a major stroke , according to a tribute on @entity6 's website by colleague @entity12 , who called him " perhaps the magazine 's most quoted writer of all time
" unlike some critics , @entity0 appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of @entity21 to the epic fantasy of " @entity23
" his all - time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow @entity6 critic @entity25 , contained everything from " @entity27 " to " @entity28 " to @entity30 's " @entity29 " " he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent
except that he was indifferent to nothing , " @entity12 wrote
" to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ' worth seeing , ' @entity0 had a stock , succinct reply : ' everything is worth seeing
' " but @entity0 was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including " titanic " ( " dead in the water " ) and even -- blasphemy ! -- " @entity45 , " about which he wrote , " the movie 's ' legs ' will prove as vulnerable as @entity48 's
" he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win @entity51
" there are movies whose feel - good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box - office successes or top prizewinners , " he once wrote
" i call this internal mechanism my @entity61 - in @entity62
" a graceful and prolific writer , @entity0 reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many @entity6 cover stories and authored four books on film , including " @entity68 : the @entity69 ( and a few you love to hate ) , " published just last year
( it was a partnership with @entity72 , which , like @entity1 , is owned by @entity73
) some credit him with coining the phrase " drop - dead gorgeous " to describe actress @entity76 in a review of her 1985 film , " into the @entity79
" he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of " @entity81 " by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review
born in @entity87 , @entity0 moved to @entity8 after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining @entity6 in 1980
he served as editor of @entity93 , the movie journal of the @entity95 , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on @entity98 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103
" it 's painful to try to find words , since @entity0 was such a master of them , " @entity6 editor @entity104 wrote in a note friday to her staffers
" they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep
it 's not clear that @entity0 ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life
" he is survived by his wife , @entity123 , a noted film critic in her own right , whom he married in 1969
people we 've lost in 2015
