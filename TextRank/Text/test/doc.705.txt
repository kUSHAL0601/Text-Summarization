her husband , @entity11 , was one of 17 people killed in january 's terror attacks in @entity17
he was in a kosher supermarket when a gunman stormed in , killing four people , all of them @entity22
the terrorist , @entity23 , recorded the attack on camera
@entity11 was laid to rest in @entity2 's @entity27 cemetery after the attacks , not far from where the @entity29 held a memorial ceremony to mourn victims of terror
" today we all share the same pain , " @entity6 said to the assembled crowd
" i know they protect us from above
" as @entity9 mourns on the nation 's remembrance day , @entity39 prime minister @entity38 announced after his weekly @entity43 meeting that @entity39 authorities had foiled a terror plot
@entity38 said that @entity39 is fully mobilized following january 's attack , which allowed authorities to identify and stop the planned attack
the latest news is a painful reminder of @entity11 's recent loss
@entity11 now lives for her young children
she has two daughters and one son
@entity11 tells them stories of their father to keep his memory alive and to keep herself strong
she pauses as she speaks , finding the right words to describe the love of her life who was taken from her
" we had 10 years of marriage together , and we were a perfect couple
it was like the day we were married , " she said , holding back tears
she has told this story before , but it does n't seem to get any easier
one month after the terror attacks in @entity17 , a gunman attacked a synagogue in @entity76 , @entity77 , killing @entity78 , who was working as a security guard for a bat mitzvah party
@entity78 , 37 , was laid to rest in @entity76
like @entity6 , @entity78 's parents attended the memorial service in @entity2
the recent attacks were on the nation 's collective mind as mourners gathered in groups to commemorate fallen soldiers and victims of terror
the @entity76 attack forced @entity11 to relive her fear
" i have no idea , " she said , hesitating
" it seems they found a way to attack outside of war
it seems easy for them to attack , and it 's frightening
" when asked where she feels at home , @entity11 does n't hesitate
it is her most confident answer
in @entity110 's name , we will move to @entity9
" @entity11 said she will move her family from @entity17 to @entity9 when she is ready , but she does not want to feel like she is running away .
