it may be time to light the lights
@entity4 is filming a proof of concept for a revival of " the @entity8 , " the @entity0 has learned
" @entity10 " co-creator @entity9 is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at may 's upfront presentation to @entity16 advertisers
sources tell @entity0 that the project , if all goes well , could go straight to series
@entity20 ( " @entity21 , " " @entity22 " ) will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner , with @entity25 's @entity24 attached to exec produce and direct the presentation
@entity4 's " @entity8 " revival is being produced by @entity29 and @entity30 , which @entity31 owns
the presentation is set to film next weekend on the @entity31 lot in @entity34 with some of the original @entity8 performers returning
sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by @entity41 — @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , among others — gathering at @entity29 for a meeting about the new " @entity48
" however , the show wo n't move forward unless @entity51 signs on , and her current relationship with frequent love @entity42 is on the rocks , preventing the show from getting off the ground
early plans call for two celebrity cameos — including @entity51 's current co-star — as well as new roles including @entity43 's girlfriend and her parents
for @entity9 , the revived " @entity8 " — which landed at @entity4 after initial interest from @entity66 — marks a return to his roots
the producer , who currently does not have an overall deal , started his career working for @entity41 in 1982 and ultimately started writing for " the @entity70 , " remaining on the series until a year after @entity41 's death in 1990
this marks the second time @entity9 has attempted to revive " the @entity8
" the writer - producer shot some test footage before @entity76 ' " @entity10 " that @entity31 ultimately passed on
for his part , @entity9 earned an emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute " @entity81 " in 1990 and has contributed writing to @entity31 's @entity8 - themed attractions
should @entity4 order " @entity8 " to series , @entity9 would juggle both that project and @entity76 ' " @entity10 , " which he exec produces
created in 1955 by @entity41 , the original @entity8 characters appeared on " @entity87 " from 1955 - 61 before going on to appear on late - night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of " @entity91 " in 1969
" @entity48 " launched on its own as a comedy - variety series and ran from 1976 - 81 , with @entity42 serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the @entity96 the franchise has spawned multiple movies ( 1979 's " @entity99 , " 1981 's " the @entity100 , " 1984 's " @entity103 " ) as well as @entity102 's 1989 series " the @entity70
" following @entity41 's death , the franchise continued with " @entity106 " airing on @entity4 in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling @entity108 from 1997 - 2000
that was the last television series to feature the @entity8 characters
on the feature side , the franchise featured 1992 's " @entity113 , " 1996 's " @entity114 " and 1999 's " @entity115 , " the latter two of which were co-produced by @entity31 , who acquired rights to the @entity8 in 2004 and formed @entity119
the company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with @entity122 's " the @entity8 , " with an eighth feature in the franchise , " @entity125 " bowing in 2014
for @entity4 , the @entity8 revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks
@entity102 has made the format a priority , unspooling @entity134 - hosted celebrity variety series " @entity135 ! " in the summer and has @entity137 entry " @entity139 " in the works
the decision to revive " the @entity8 " also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small - screen , as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space
on the comedy side , " the @entity8 " arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half - hours
@entity9 is repped by @entity155 and @entity156 ; @entity20 is with @entity157 ; @entity24 is with @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160
