two @entity0 are among the earthquake survivors in @entity2 , @entity3
and they are struggling in the aftermath
@entity5 , who rescues victims of sex trafficking , has a rehabilitation center in @entity2 that is home to 425 young women and girls
while her primary facility seems structurally unharmed , all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks , followed by a second earthquake on may 12
the once - vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry
" we are suffering with rain , strong wind
the fear is not gone from us
it is very , very hard , " said @entity5 , the founder of the nonprofit @entity29 and the 2010 @entity0
the public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera
@entity5 's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food
still , she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster
" these girls are most vulnerable , because now people will target them , " @entity5 said
" they could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse
maybe rape , maybe they will be trafficked , anything
... if i get more support i will take as many as i can
" about five miles away , the wall of @entity5 's hiv / aids hospice has crumbled
home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard
" they 're not injured , but they are terrified , " @entity5 said
" everything is broken in the hospice
" @entity5 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged
" it 's really very sad for me and for my children , " @entity5 said
" this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it
i was not afraid that i was going to be killed
i was afraid about what is going to happen next
" another @entity0 , @entity72 , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence
they are now living on the ground in a nearby field
" physically , we are not hurt
but mentally , we are , " said @entity72 , whose @entity79 provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated
@entity72 says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down
she and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves
" it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , " @entity72 said
" we are really scared
" they also do n't have much water or food , @entity72 says
but she is trying to stay positive
" i think for the time being , whatever we have , we should be happy , you know ? because at least we have our life , " she said
" ( my kids ) all are safe
that 's the most important thing for me
" @entity72 's " @entity113 " -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake
@entity72 had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october
@entity72 purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 @entity0
" when the earthquake hit that land , all my dreams were scattered , " she said
" i have to restart again
" still , @entity72 is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid
to that end , several @entity0 have been assisting in relief efforts in @entity3
@entity134 's disaster relief organization , @entity133 , has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in @entity2
the group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the @entity3 people in several remote villages outside of the city
six canine - firefighter search teams from the @entity145 also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts
the teams were trained by @entity150 's @entity149 and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers , hazmat experts and doctors
@entity157 's @entity156 , which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies , has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families
dr. @entity162 's group , @entity161 , sent solar suitcases to health care workers , providing them with light and power as they aid survivors
@entity169 's group , @entity168 , has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies , especially in hard - hit districts
@entity174 , a disaster response midwife who founded @entity177 , joined @entity169 in @entity2 to help the mothers
@entity180 's nonprofit , wine to @entity182 , partnered with @entity183 in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in @entity3
the group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly .
