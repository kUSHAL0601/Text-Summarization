cigarettes have been put out across the bars of @entity3
cigars are welcome no more
the city known for excess of everything -- drinking , eating , dancing in the street until all hours -- went smoke - free as tuesday became wednesday at midnight
how can that be ? it turns out that the city known for its over-the - top @entity14 celebrations and incredible jazz fests ( starting friday ! ) did n't want its waiters and musicians to have to breathe smoke to do their jobs anymore
the @entity22 passed its ban against smoking in most places across the city -- including bars , casinos and restaurants -- in january , and the vote was unanimous , the @entity21 reports
bar owners worried about potential revenue loss , while puffing customers bemoaned the loss of their smoking spots
@entity38 's @entity3 and bar owners filed a lawsuit to stop the ban , and a hearing is scheduled in state court in a month , @entity1 affiliate @entity36 reports
fines start at $ 50
luckily for us , none of @entity1 's 15 @entity3 must - do 's -- including touring @entity45 or eating a beignet -- requires smoking .
