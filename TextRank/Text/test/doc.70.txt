@entity1 's space agency announced this week that the country would put an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018 , joining an elite club of nations who have explored @entity11 's satellite
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , divulged the plan to an expert panel , including members of the cabinet and the @entity17 on monday
" this is an initial step and a lot of procedures are still ahead before the plan is formally approved , " a @entity12 spokesperson told reporters
if it is approved , the agency will reportedly use its @entity26 solid - fuel rocket technology to carry and deploy a slim probe -- the acronym stands for " @entity29 " -- on the surface of the celestial body
@entity1 media estimates that the mission will cost in the region of ¥ 10 billion to ¥ 15 billion ( $ 83.4 million - $ 125 million )
@entity12 spokesperson @entity35 confirmed to @entity2 that this estimate is realistic
the mission is expected to be used to perfect soft - landing technologies , which could be utilized in future , manned expeditions to the moon , or even @entity42
the lander will use face recognition software found in digital cameras , which will be repurposed to enable the craft to recognize craters on the surface , @entity35 said
the move could be seen as @entity1 's attempt to play catchup to its @entity53 neighbors @entity54 and @entity55 , which have both notched significant extraterrestrial victories in recent years -- @entity54 's @entity59 lunar rover outlasted expectations and @entity55 successfully put a probe into orbit around @entity42 the first time of asking
in 2008 @entity1 put its @entity65 craft -- known in @entity1 as @entity66 , after a @entity1 moon princess from a 10th century folk tale -- into orbit around the moon to gather data about its surface
the data gathered by the orbiter will also be used to calculate a suitable landing site for the rover
@entity12 has also put a probe on an asteroid , which returned to @entity11 in 2010
along with @entity54 , the @entity79 and the @entity80 are the only other nations to have so far landed craft on the surface of the moon
@entity2 's @entity85 contributed to this report .
