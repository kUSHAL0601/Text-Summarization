the @entity0 is urging @entity2 to release five young feminists who face years in prison over their campaign for gender equality
authorities detained the women in three cities -- @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- a few days ahead of events planned for @entity14 on march 8
" each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world , " @entity0 secretary of state @entity15 said in a statement friday
" we strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues , and we believe that @entity2 authorities should also support them , not silence them
" the detention of @entity32 , along with @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 has drawn harsh criticism from the international community
protesters in several cities have called for their release and taken to social media with the phrase " free the five " as a hashtag
@entity46 , the lawyer for @entity32 , said police recommended monday that prosecutors press charges of " assembling a crowd to disturb public order
" prosecutors have seven days -- until monday -- to decide whether to pursue the charges , according to the lawyer
" we can do nothing but wait , " @entity35 said
the five were initially held on suspicion of " picking quarrels and provoking trouble
" @entity35 said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed
" neither should constitute a crime , " he said
campaign group @entity62 said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum prison term of five years
" the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal
they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , " said @entity68 , @entity2 researcher at @entity62
@entity35 said that @entity32 was subjected to lengthy cross examinations during her detention
two of the women are said to be in poor health
he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for @entity14 and earlier campaigns against domestic violence
the five are members of @entity2 's @entity84
they had planned to hand out stickers with slogans saying " stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe " and " go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! " on @entity14
this week , @entity15 's predecessor , @entity92 , tweeted that the activists ' detention was " inexcusable
" @entity2 authorities rebuked her comment , saying public figures should respect the nation 's sovereignty and independence
@entity1 's @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report
