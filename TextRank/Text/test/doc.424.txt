the " @entity1 " universe keeps on expanding
details of the plot for 2016 's " @entity1 : @entity10 " were revealed during a panel at @entity7 fan festival sunday in @entity8 , @entity9
director @entity11 ( " @entity12 " ) showed an early teaser for the movie and revealed plot details for the " @entity1 " anthology film ( the term @entity18 prefers instead of " spinoff " ) , starring @entity20

a group of rebels go on a rogue mission to steal plans for the @entity30
@entity31 will play a rebel soldier
the movie wo n't begin shooting until this summer so the footage shown in the teaser -- including a glimpse of the @entity30 -- wo n't necessarily appear in the finished product
@entity11 told the crowd that @entity31 is a " @entity1 " fan and dropped everything to take on the lead role
producer @entity41 said " @entity10 " was one of the first pitches she received after becoming president of @entity45 in 2012 , and she could not turn it down
it was one of the final events at @entity7 , where fans gather to talk about " @entity1 , " dress in costumes , look for rare " @entity1 " merchandise and learn about future projects for the franchise
the convention kicked off with the well - received trailer for this year 's " @entity57
" costumes and props from that movie also were on display
anything bearing the movie logo was a hot item for collectors
tens of thousands are expected to have attended the event when all is said and done
