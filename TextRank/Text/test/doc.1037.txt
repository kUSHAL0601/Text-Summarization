it was right after one of the longest lockouts in @entity5 history
@entity6 , then playing for the @entity7 , was looking forward to getting back to the hardwood
that was until a routine physical stopped him in his tracks
the physical revealed he had an aortic aneurysm near the left valve of his heart
" i was shocked , " said the @entity17 small forward
" i had no symptoms of fatigue , shortness of breath
" @entity6 had to have open heart surgery
" leading up to it was nerve - racking , " he said
" i could n't run
i could n't touch a basketball
i could n't get stressed out , it was tough
" as @entity6 learned how doctors would open up his chest to repair his heart , he considered the possibility he may never play basketball again
" the first couple of weeks after i was told , i really focused in on my career and what was next , " said the basketball player
" i wanted to make sure if i wanted to come back , i was able to come back and play the same way i did before i left
" if that opportunity was n't there , @entity6 wanted to have a backup plan
so , he headed back to his college roots at @entity41 , finished his degree and became the first person in his family to graduate from college
@entity6 's @entity5 basketball career was n't over , but it was a slow progression back to the court
he missed the entire 2011 - 2012 season
" i did n't even watch any basketball , " he said
" six months after the surgery was the first time i set foot on a court
" it was with the @entity55 where @entity6 laid back down the foundation of his game , healing his body and regaining muscle
" the timing was off , " he said
" i was n't concerned about getting hit , the biggest thing was just being in shape and being able to move and being able to function on the floor
" @entity6 believes the surgery and hard road back to the @entity5 have given him a new perspective and more meaning in his life
" i will never forget those days that i could walk 15 steps for five minutes , " he said
" now i attack every game like this could be my last
" " i feel like the year i missed really added more years , " he explained
" it added more life into what i 'm doing because i 'm more grateful for it
" @entity6 's now using his story to raise awareness of hidden heart risk
he also spends time with children dealing with cardiac issues -- often telling them they are " superheroes " and encouraging them to " show off your scar -- embrace it ! "
