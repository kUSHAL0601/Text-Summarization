, rocker @entity0 announced he 'll take a hiatus from touring
@entity0 will wrap his touring efforts in support of " @entity9 " with a brief , first - ever acoustic tour that will hit " the only five states left in the @entity12 that he has yet to play , " according to @entity0 's website
rounding out the acoustic quartet on tour will be @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
the shows will be unannounced until day - of - show , with tickets priced at $ 3 and limited to one ticket per person , to be purchased only at the venue on a first - come , first - served basis
@entity1 : @entity0 on not being a ' @entity26 , ' living in the @entity27 and why vinyl records are ' hypnotic ' the purposely vague announcement surely has fans ( and journalists ) scouring the internet for @entity0 's touring history
unclear is whether @entity0 includes his work with @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 in his touring history , or just his solo road work
presumably , he 's including all of his touring , with all bands , as @entity1 could find only 29 states in which he has performed as @entity0
tour dates with @entity36 add another 12 states
that leaves nine states for which we could not find a show for @entity0 : @entity50 ( where a show is scheduled for tomorrow , april 15 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58
@entity1 : @entity0 plays the hits , @entity60 ' at @entity3 through the process of elimination ( surely he has played @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 ? ) , our guess as to which five " states " @entity0 will play on the brief acoustic run : @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity55 , @entity56 and ... @entity71 ? if that 's the case , this tour is in for some long jumps , with @entity71 to @entity56 being a potential beast
( though shipping acoustic instruments and ribbon mics will be a lot less taxing than a full electrified stage setup
