in july of 2013 , the oldest of @entity1 relics stories rose again when @entity5 archaeologists discovered a stone chest in a 1,350 - year - old church that appeared to contain a piece of @entity1 ' cross
" we have found a holy thing in a chest
it is a piece of a cross , " said excavation team leader @entity13 , an art historian and archaeologist
at the time , she thought the chest served as a symbolic coffin for a holy person 's relics -- ones connected to @entity1 ' crucifixion
the latest relic of the cross on which @entity1 had died stalled out because , as @entity13 later said , the box that had contained allegedly holy objects was now -- mysteriously -- empty
the latest episode of the " true cross , " a powerful identifier for the faith of more than two billion people , is symbolic of the pitfalls in the hunt for @entity1 relics
to say something smacks of the " true cross " can mean it 's a matter of divine certainty or of utter fraud
could fragments of the true cross of @entity1 really be among us today ? could fragments of a tree survive millennia ? or are they fragments of forgery that speak to our need to believe ? the true cross phenomenon begins with @entity52 , the first roman emperor to convert to @entity53
he sent his mother @entity55 ( c. 246 - 330 ce ) to find @entity1 objects in the @entity57
when @entity55 traveled to @entity59 in 326 ce the city was still suffering the destruction caused by the last @entity62 in 132 - 35 ce. after defeating @entity64 , roman emperor @entity58 built a pagan temple over @entity1 's tomb near @entity67 -- a grave insult to the new religion
@entity70 ordered this pagan temple torn down and began to dig beneath it to find relics related to @entity1
her workers found three different crosses -- a discovery directly relating to the @entity77 , which tell us that @entity1 was crucified along with two criminals
the historian @entity80 ( c. 340 - 410 ) reveals that in order to discern which cross was @entity1 ' , @entity55 had a dying local woman brought to the site
the ill woman touched two of the crosses , but nothing happened
then she touched the third -- and she recovered
the true cross of @entity1 had been revealed
@entity55 carved it up , leaving some of it in @entity59 and transporting a chunk to @entity94 where it seemingly multiplied , so much so that @entity96 reformer @entity95 said : " ... if all the pieces that could be found were collected together , they would make a big ship - load
yet the @entity77 testifies that a single man was able to carry it
" but was @entity95 exaggerating to support his own reforms to @entity103 ? how could we ever know what the true cross was made of , or looked like , since neither the @entity77 -- nor the @entity107 -- bothered to tell us ? enter science
in 1870 , @entity110 architect @entity109 catalogued all known fragments of the true cross
he determined the @entity1 cross weighed 165 pounds , was three or four meters high , with a cross beam two meters wide
if all these bits of the cross were cobbled together , he reckoned , they would n't amount to a third of the cross on which @entity1 died
and based on the fragments he was allowed to examine by microscope , @entity109 concluded the true cross was made of pine wood
later , four cross particles were also microscopically examined -- part of ten pieces of the true cross , accompanied by documentary proofs from @entity127 emperors
these fragments came from grand @entity94 churches : @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 in @entity133 , and the @entity134 of @entity135 and @entity136
but scientists discovered that they were all made of olive wood
so now the question became : was the cross of @entity1 made of olive wood or pine ? one of the perplexing realities for archaeologists is a lack of residual wood from the massive record of @entity107 crucifixion
despite the fact the @entity107 killed tens of thousands of people through crucifixion -- and as many as 500 a day during the siege of @entity59 from 66 - 70 ce -- the only piece of evidence connected to this terrible punishment was discovered in 1968 , when archaeologists found the heel bone of a crucified man with the nail still intact
in the @entity163 in @entity59 , @entity159 , who teaches anatomy and archaeology at @entity162 , said that the heel bone of the crucified man was found in a jewish burial tomb in a northern suburb of @entity59 , near @entity67 -- the hill where the @entity107 crucified people
the man , whose ossuary , or burial box , identified him as @entity171 , was in his mid 20s when he died on the cross
his good teeth and lack of heavy musculature meant that he most likely came from a wealthy family , for most crucifixion victims were far too humble to wind up in tombs -- save for @entity1 , who was put in one by the wealthy @entity181
others buried in the same tomb as @entity171 had connections to the @entity185 , so it 's possible that he was killed by the @entity107 for some political transgression
@entity171 was cut down from the cross with a 4.5 - inch nail still in his right heel bone , and with part of a board still attached to the head of the nail
@entity159 believes that the relative shortness of the length of the nail reveals much about @entity198 crucifixion methods
" the nail was too short ( to go through ) two heel bones , so sure enough each foot was hammered separately to the cross
" @entity159 is convinced that crosses were not made from olive trees because the people depended on the olive tree for food and would n't be slashing them down to make crosses
more importantly , for the purpose at hand , they would n't be suitable because of the structure of the tree itself
olive trees do n't grow tall and straight , it branches everywhere , and there are a lot of holes in the wood , making it difficult to support the nails against the weight of the victim
" the olive tree is the least appropriate tree
we have different type of local oaks that better serve the purpose
" today there are even more " true cross " fragments on display around the world : on @entity250 , in @entity131 , in @entity236 , in @entity237 , in @entity238 , in @entity133 , in @entity239 , in @entity240 -- and even in @entity241 , @entity242 , where a fragment of the true cross came along as part of the family chapel imported there and rebuilt by @entity248 for his @entity110 bride
if you want your own sliver of the cross on which @entity1 died , @entity251 offers several choices -- with some having original wax seals preserving " integrity " and some having documents attesting to their authenticity
@entity260 , a professor at @entity262 's @entity261 , says that this continued emphasis on the genuineness of true cross fragments is often at the expense of the cross 's meaning
" the thing about the cross is you 've always got to remember that it 's about the person who hung there , the wood itself in the end is just the instrument of torture
" @entity279 is co-author , with @entity280 , of " finding @entity1 : @entity281
: six holy objects that tell the @entity285 of the @entity77
