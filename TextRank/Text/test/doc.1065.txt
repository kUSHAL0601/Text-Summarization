@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers
his feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others
and observers were quick to point out that @entity0 had previously criticized binge drinking in @entity1
@entity0 was in a @entity16 pub on saturday evening when a group of @entity18 players invited him to have a drink with them
the prime minister accepted and even gave a short , impromptu speech , one of the football coaches , @entity25 , told @entity26
" then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head - to - toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head
and he was proud as punch , " @entity25 said
a schooner holds about three - quarters of a pint
video of @entity39 making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants " @entity44 ! @entity44 ! " drew plenty of attention on social media
some commentators focused on @entity0 's drinking technique
but others suggested he was setting a bad example
@entity0 had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year
" like most @entity1 , i enjoy a drink on social occasions , " he said in january 2014
" however , as a father and as a citizen , i 'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent , especially at " hot spots " in our big cities
" casting those concerns aside , some social media users belittled @entity0 's beer swilling
they said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former prime minister @entity67 , who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds .
