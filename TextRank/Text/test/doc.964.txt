for those wondering if we would ever hear from the @entity4 family again , the answer would appear to be yes
" @entity7 " executive producer @entity6 said the show will return for a fifth season of 17 episodes
the @entity12 mogul was interviewed on @entity14 ' podcast recently , and let it drop that fans can expect more of the quirky comedy
@entity18 had no comment for @entity5 when asked to verify his statements
the fourth season was streamed exclusively on @entity18 in 2013 , after @entity23 canceled the show several years before
despite critical acclaim , the series never had big ratings , but has a devoted fan base , who often quote from the show
it was not yet known if the full cast , including @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , will return for the season .
