emergency operators get lots of crazy calls , but few start like this
caller : " hello , i 'm trapped in this plane and i called my job , but i 'm in this plane
" operator : " you 're where ? " caller : " i 'm inside a plane and i feel like it 's up moving in the air
@entity17 can you please tell somebody ( to ) stop it
" the frantic 911 call came just as the @entity22 flight had taken off from @entity23 on monday afternoon
the caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane 's cargo hold
the cell phone call soon broke up , but the man was making himself known in other ways as the crew and passengers reported unusual banging from the belly of the @entity34
the pilot radioed air traffic control and said he would make an emergency landing
" there could be a person in there so we 're going to come back around , " he told air traffic control
the ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of @entity46 , a contractor for @entity22 that handles loading the luggage
he 'll no longer have the option of dozing aboard one of the airline 's planes
" the @entity46 employee has been permanently banned from working on @entity22 planes , " said @entity52 , a spokeswoman for the airline
@entity17 , which was on its way to @entity57 , only spent 14 minutes in the air
other than being scared , the agent never was in any real danger
the cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled , the airline said
the passengers knew something was n't right , almost as soon as the plane took off
" all of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear , " @entity67 told @entity1 affiliate @entity68
not everyone heard the banging , but it was soon clear this was n't a normal flight
" we just took off for @entity81 regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we 'd land within five to seven minutes , and we did , " passenger @entity79 told affiliate @entity68
" when we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane
" " i think it 's scary and really unsafe , too , " @entity88 told affiliate @entity68
" because what if it 's someone who could have been a terrorist ? " the employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m. , just before the flight departed
the agent was off the two days prior to the incident and had taken a lunch break and a break in the afternoon before making his way into the cargo hold , according to a source familiar with the investigation
the man had been on a four - person team loading baggage onto the flight
" during a pre-departure huddle , the team lead noticed the employee was missing
the team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee 's cell phone , but did not receive an answer
his co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home , " the airline 's blog said
it 's believed he was hidden by luggage , making it difficult for the rest of his team to see him , the source said
all ramp employees have security badges , and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired , according to the airline
after the delay , the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to @entity57 a couple of hours late
@entity1 's @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .
