from @entity2 twerking for @entity3 to host @entity5 's archery fail , there were plenty of highlights and misfires from the 2015 @entity9
2015 @entity9 : see the full winners list here are the jokes , performances and moments that hit the target and the ones and missed it
best moments @entity5 's opener : from a " boyhood " / @entity23 joke to nearly flashing @entity20 to her run - in with a cancer support group , @entity5 's opening video segment was as reliably hilarious and inventive as her @entity25 show ( which ca n't come back on tv soon enough )
plus , her monologue killed : " half of you know who i am , half of you think i 'm @entity33
" @entity2 doing his thing : when the cast of " @entity37 " presented @entity3 with the scared as shit performance award , she asked them exactly what we were all thinking : " why are n't you dancing ? " @entity2 obliged , popping a twerk ( in a suit ) onstage in front of @entity45
" your turn , " he told her
sadly , she did not oblige
@entity5 takes on @entity47 , @entity48 and more in monologue @entity50 's censored moment : introducing an exclusive clip from " @entity52 " as an " exclusive clit " was easily the funniest @entity55 joke of the entire night
even her castmates seemed shocked when she slipped it in
@entity59 meets @entity60 : " @entity64 " did n't need a rap breakdown , nor did " @entity63 " need a punk - rock edge
but did it sound killer on both counts ? hell yeah
@entity68 with an electric guitar is something that needs to happen again
@entity71 , @entity72 & @entity73 : there 's a reason @entity76 gets invited to every @entity9 awards show : she attacks a pop song with the abandon of a rock ' n ' roll tidal wave
" @entity80 " was @entity73 's time to shine , though
it 's only a shame she got about 30 seconds to command the stage
@entity84 : @entity5 sensuously kissing @entity85 just before a commercial break ? well played , @entity5
@entity88 's @entity87 : while @entity91 's intro jokes were a little one - note ( we get it , @entity88 is short ) , it was pretty adorable that @entity88 brought his kids onstage to accept his @entity95
as his son held it , you realized the award was bigger than the kid 's head
@entity9 : see all the photos @entity103 accepting @entity104 : his speech was fine ( kudos for the " keep your nose clean " quip ) , but his @entity111 castmates taking a knee while he accepted his award was just perfect
misfires archery fail : @entity5 's bow - and - arrow misfire was a literal misfire
it was n't a big deal , but the fact that it ruined an entire gag ( with @entity91 pretending to get shot in the chest ) was naturally awkward
of course , @entity5 poked fun at herself almost immediately
" @entity124 " joke : " how good was gone girl ? it 's the story of what one crazed white woman -- or every @entity128 -- does when a man cheats on them , " @entity5 joked
it was n't awful , just kinda off
@entity9 immediately cut to @entity133 laughing like " ummm , ok " -- which is an accurate response
@entity135 sings ' @entity136 ' @entity138 tribute song at @entity9 @entity139 speech : @entity139 definitely marches to the beat of her own drum , which is part of her appeal
but halfway through her @entity146 acceptance speech , the neo-hippie charm wore off , leaving most people wondering what she was trying to say
one of those wondering where she was going was @entity139 herself , who wrapped up her speech by admitting it had totally gotten away from her
@entity156 and @entity157 : was the punchline for their whole shtick really just @entity156 grabbing @entity157 's balls ? yes
apparently , a man touching another man 's junk is still comedy gold in 2015
@entity166 : the @entity166 shouting into the camera about 2014 's movie highlights was totally unnecessary
at this point , @entity9 has to realize we 've heard jokes about " @entity172 " , " @entity124 " , " boyhood " and " @entity174 " for almost a year now , and we 're all ready to move on
but @entity175 @entity166 for giving it his all .
