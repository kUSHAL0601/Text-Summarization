from the giant sequoias of @entity4 to the geysers of @entity6 , the @entity2 ' national parks were made for you and me
and for saturday and sunday , they 're also free
though most of the @entity11 's 407 sites are free year - round , the 128 parks that charge a fee -- like @entity6 and @entity4 -- will be free those two days
it 's all part of @entity16 , happening april 18 through april 26 , and it 's hosted by the @entity11 and the @entity17
check out night - time astronomy parties , daytime @entity20 programs , @entity22 parties and family - friendly junior ranger activities at national park sites across the country
not sure how to start ? go to @entity26 to learn more about park sites near you
go to www.nationalparkweek.org for more ideas on how to explore
then the park service wants people to share their stories using the hashtag @entity33 and at @entity26 .
