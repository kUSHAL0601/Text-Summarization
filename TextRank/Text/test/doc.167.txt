they were huddled in the back of a tugboat
their coats and jackets , still wet , were piled up in a huge container behind them
the 117 migrants , mostly from @entity11 , arrived in the port of @entity13 , @entity14 , around 1p.m
tuesday , after being picked up by the tugboat off the coast of @entity17
the two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy , the tug 's @entity19 captain told me
the discarded coats , he said , would be thrown away
we had flown to @entity14 from @entity26 following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea
the tragedy adds to the mounting death toll among those fleeing war and poverty in @entity11 and the @entity35
so far this year as many as 900 have lost their lives
last year at least 3,200 died making the journey
since 2000 , according to the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the @entity41
thousands may have died , but even more have succeeded in making the treacherous journey
this small group in @entity13 were among nearly 10,000 migrants who have arrived on @entity47 shores since the weekend , according to the @entity47 @entity48
with the onset of spring and calmer seas , it appears that the flow of migrants is not relenting
the group , which included 31 women , was composed mostly of @entity56 and @entity57
as they filed off the boat , representatives of the @entity47 @entity59 did a quick visual inspection , checking for fever , scabies , any sign of illness
one woman , they discovered , was two months pregnant
@entity69 , in his mid- 20s from @entity56 , told me he left his home nine months ago
he paid human traffickers in @entity73 1,000 @entity17 dinars , more than $ 700 , for the voyage
for him , it 's a fortune
i asked 28 - year - old @entity77 , from @entity78 , why he had left his home
" it 's not like in @entity80 , " he told me
" after 20 , 25 years , you have to make a future for yourself
but in @entity78 , i could n't
my family , they do n't have nothing
" @entity87 , from @entity88 in northern @entity56 , seemed shell - shocked
in a faint voice she told me she had left @entity88 because her family feared she that would be taken by @entity92
" i was scared , " 25 - year - old @entity93 from @entity78 told me about the journey from @entity17
" i was taking a big risk
either i enter @entity80 or i die
" another man , from @entity97 , told me he had lived and worked in @entity17 for 15 years , but was terrified at the prospect of @entity99 gaining even more territory
an @entity102 translator working for the @entity47 police told me they had information that a large group of @entity107 were gathered in a @entity73 warehouse , and were expected to make the journey to @entity47 in the coming days
it seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of @entity11 and the @entity35 -- grinding poverty , war and the rise of @entity99 -- are washing up on the shores of @entity47
the wars , unrest , upheaval , misery and injustice i 've covered over the last 20 years , in @entity107 , in @entity17 , in @entity123 and elsewhere , seem to be coming together to remind those who have enjoyed @entity80 's relative peace and prosperity that no man is an island
the small group of migrants in @entity13 has been taken in by the @entity47 authorities
they 've been fed , clothed , received medical treatment , and will be taken to migrant camp in northern @entity47
most will then try move further north , to countries like @entity137 , @entity138 , the @entity139 and the @entity140 , where economic opportunities are better than in austerity - wracked @entity47
others will stay in @entity47 , trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars
and as they settle in , somehow or other , more and more will come to @entity47 's shores .
