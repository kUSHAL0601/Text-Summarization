a @entity1 reserve deputy is on administrative leave after " inadvertently " shooting a suspect with his gun
police say @entity7 , 73 , thought he pulled out his taser during an arrest , but instead shot the suspect , who later died at a local hospital
the shooting happened after an apparent drug and gun selling operation by the @entity17 task force thursday
@entity7 , a member of the task force , was part of a group of deputies trying to arrest @entity21 , 44 , in the parking lot of a @entity23
police say @entity21 , a convicted felon , sold undercover officers a pistol
when confronted by an arrest team , he fled the scene on foot and police say they " observed him reaching for his waistband area ... causing concern for the deputies safety
" after a brief pursuit , police say @entity21 was forced to the ground , where he continued to resist arrest and " refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband
" it was during this portion of the arrest that police say " the reserve deputy was attempting to use less lethal force , believing he was utilizing a @entity8 , when he inadvertently discharged his service weapon , firing one round which struck @entity21
" @entity21 died at a local hospital and his cause of death is under investigation
police say @entity21 admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of @entity60 , a street drug commonly known as @entity60
when asked if another gun was found on @entity21 , @entity65 of the @entity66 says " the suspect was placed in the ambulance and transported so quickly
i have not been told there was a second weapon found on him yet
" deputy @entity70 , who 's been placed on administrative leave during the investigation , received his reserve status from the @entity66 in 2008 and was assigned to the violent crime task force
he had also served as a @entity1 police officer
when asked by @entity76 whether age may have played a factor in the " inadvertent " shooting , @entity65 says " did an accident happen ? sure
but is it accredited to his age ? or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation ? i guess that will be determined in the investigation
" @entity2 's @entity88 , @entity89 contributed to this report
