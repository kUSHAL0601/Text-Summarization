a @entity1 gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded
the whale , named @entity8 , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from @entity10 , whose scientists helped conduct the whale - tracking study
@entity8 , which is @entity15 for " @entity16 , " left her primary feeding ground off @entity15 's @entity18 to cross the @entity1 and down the @entity19 of the @entity20 to @entity21 , @entity22
@entity8 's journey surpassed a record listed on the @entity26 website
it said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190 - mile round trip between the " warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food - rich waters of the @entity35 and @entity37 regions
" records are nice , but @entity39 , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim
during her 14,000 - mile journey , @entity8 visited " three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , " which was a surprise to mate , who is also the director of the @entity49 at @entity10
" for her to go to @entity22 , " @entity39 said , " it 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from
" @entity8 was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to " navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , " he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays
with only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower
" past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , " @entity39 said
