the @entity1 is getting a new $ 81.6 million stadium for its hockey , basketball and volleyball teams
it 'll have luxury suites and everything
but it seems all anyone can talk about these days ... @entity11 ... is the taco cannon
that 's right , we said taco cannon
an @entity17 taco shop has teamed up with the university to shoot tacos into the stands at sporting events
that the foil - wrapped eats will make to fans was made evident when @entity26 owner @entity25 demonstrated the power of the cannon for @entity0 affiliate @entity29
that they 'll make it undamaged ? not so much
" i would n't say it would be as restaurant quality when it gets to them , but it 's edible , " @entity25 said
with this latest technological development , the taco will join t - shirts , stuffed toys , balls , biscuits and the lowly hot dog in hurtling into the stands at public gatherings
@entity1 fans , um , ate the idea up , sending # tacocannon hurtling past # @entity47 as the no. 1 trending topic wednesday in @entity17
" how we roll in @entity17 ... @entity56 appearances and projectile tacos , " @entity50 user mavpuck said , referring to the school 's recent , and sadly taco-less , appearance in the @entity54 hockey tournament semifinals
" this just might be the greatest invention
ever , " thetoddbryant wrote on @entity50
the tacos will start flying this fall , when the school 's new arena is scheduled to open
but @entity26 has already scored , catching plenty of publicity months ahead of opening night
" my partners laughed and me and said ' that 's dumb , ' " @entity25 told @entity29
" now they 're emailing me and saying , ' about the best thing we 've ever bought
