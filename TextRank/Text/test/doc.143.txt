there are two paths to practicing medicine in @entity4
there 's the traditional , time - tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians
then there 's the approach being forged in @entity14 and @entity15 : getting elected to a state legislature
lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice
in 2011 , @entity14 enacted the @entity21 , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety
guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk
asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry
i treat brain injuries , and it 's part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them , like driving
some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets , typically fired by family members or themselves
does anyone really believe i should n't talk about gun safety in these cases ? it 's a good thing i do n't practice in @entity14
@entity14 's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three - judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th @entity64 decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the @entity14 chapter of the @entity55 , dr. @entity56 , told me
he is a plaintiff in the case
in @entity15 , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer
@entity71 goes a step beyond silencing doctors
it requires them to lie
the bill was originally a hum - drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services , a common state and federal strategy
but legislators slid in a last - minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill @entity86 tell patients the pill is reversible
that 's the opinion of a particular @entity91 doctor who says this can be done through risky , large doses of progesterone
but the doctor has n't proven his case , and his regimen is not recommended by the @entity97 or the @entity98
any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the @entity91 regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient - doctor relationship
i can not imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client
why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the @entity119 would never permit ? dr. @entity120 , chairwoman of the @entity15 chapter of the @entity97 , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the @entity124
while @entity126 and the @entity127 joined her organization in criticizing the provision , the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor
there 's a common relationship shared by these laws , beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople
these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer
physicians do n't all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote @entity144 or @entity145
this is part of the reason the key state physicians ' associations are n't taking the lead in battling these laws
the battle is left to the specialties most affected
in @entity14 , that 's the state 's chapter of the @entity55 , since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home
in @entity15 , it 's the state chapter of the @entity97 carrying the torch for physician free speech
the @entity162 did n't provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the @entity168 told me in a statement that " @entity171 's policy is to take no position on abortion
" representing physicians as a whole , the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses
the @entity179 ( @entity180 ) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate " @entity186 " to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by @entity14 's gun law in particular
members are concerned about the precedent being set
@entity189 enacted a law similar to @entity15 just days later
the @entity191 can do more
it did file a friend - of - the - court brief as part of the @entity14 legal challenge , but at this writing has n't weighed in on @entity15
the @entity171 did n't sign on to a statement released last week by the @entity198 to protect the patient - provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care
its huge lobbying operations are tied up in @entity204 , while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice
now that the @entity171 has won the age - old " doc fix " battle , ending automatic @entity214 payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who 've abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession
we have a surgeon general now , @entity224 , and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april 22 , @entity228 , a @entity230 spokesman told me
i hope @entity224 will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .
