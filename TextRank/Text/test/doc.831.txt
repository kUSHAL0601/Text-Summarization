more than 22 months ago , the body of @entity1 was found in an industrial park in @entity4 , @entity5
@entity1 had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste
the semipro football player for the @entity10 was 27
days after he was found dead , then - @entity12 star @entity11 was arrested and charged with murder
testimony in the case against @entity11 began in january
on wednesday , a @entity18 , @entity5 , jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former @entity21 patriots tight end guilty of first - degree murder , which carries a penalty of life without parole , as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition
@entity11 also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide
he has pleaded not guilty
just two years ago , he was one of the @entity12 's most promising tight ends , inking a $ 40 - million contract extension with the @entity21
friends and fans alike wondered : how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder ? long before @entity11 made national headlines , he was a standout athlete in @entity41 , @entity42 , who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty
" i do n't think there was another family that was more familiar in @entity41 , " @entity46 , who covers high school sports for the @entity48 , told @entity2
the young @entity11 was the " golden boy , " playing football , basketball and running track , following in the footsteps of his uncle , older brother and father -- all well - known athletes in the community
@entity11 's father constantly pushed his son , requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends
" i saw a closeness with them that i 'd never seen before , " @entity46 said of the relationship between @entity11 and his father
but his father , the man who kept the 16 - year - old anchored , died from complications after a routine surgery
@entity11 left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the @entity74 , and trouble seemed to follow
in just his first semester , a police report says , @entity11 got into a fight at an off - campus restaurant , sucker - punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum
the following fall , there was a shooting near a local club
police reports linked @entity11 and several other @entity74 football players to an argument in the parking lot
@entity11 was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police , and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel
at the time , @entity11 's mother told the @entity94 newspaper , " i know he was at the club , but he never saw any shooting
" the case remains open , and no one has been charged
@entity11 was also suspended at least once for marijuana , an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year
trying to put the alleged drug use behind him , @entity11 wrote a letter to the @entity21 director of personnel
" if you draft me as a member of the @entity21 , i will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season
... in addition , i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test , " he wrote , according to the @entity110
before the draft , @entity11 was expected to be a first - or second - round pick
he was passed over until the fourth round , when the @entity21 selected him
by the end of his second season , he was a bona fide star , landing the $ 40 million contract extension
less than a year after signing the deal , however , the @entity21 dropped him on the day he was charged with @entity1 's murder
when @entity1 pulled up in a black @entity127 , @entity10 coach @entity126 thought something was out of place
@entity1 did n't own a car
@entity11 case : who 's who ? branch had his suspicions , but he could n't get answers
@entity1 was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night
" he said he was at the club with mr. @entity11 , and that they were partying and he had a good time , and that mr. @entity11 spent a good amount of money , " @entity126 recalled
@entity1 said @entity11 spent about $ 10,000 that night
@entity1 's friends say he was n't a big partier
he was more passionate about football and family
remembering @entity1 @entity1 was dating @entity148 , the link between the young man who dreamed of the @entity12 and the all - american who made it
@entity148 is the younger sister of @entity152 , who 's engaged to @entity11 and is the mother of his little girl
on june 16 , 2013 , @entity1 was riding with friends in the black suburban , which police later learned was rented by @entity11
@entity158 was with @entity1 when he said @entity1 got a text from @entity11 , asking to hang out later that night
as they parted ways , @entity1 told @entity158 he 'd see him later
the next day , @entity1 's body was found
prosecutors say @entity1 was last seen with @entity11 and @entity11 's two associates , @entity165 and @entity166 , around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver @entity168
surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an @entity168 heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. at the same time , chilling text messages from @entity1 's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with " @entity12 , " adding , " just so u know
" between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. , workers nearby reported hearing gunshots
at 3:29 , a camera showed an @entity168 pulling into @entity11 's driveway , about a half a mile from the death scene
three people got out of the car , and @entity1 was not one of them
nine days later , @entity11 was arrested and charged with first - degree murder and other weapons - related charges
in april 2014 , @entity165 and @entity166 were also charged in @entity1 's slaying
they , too , pleaded not guilty
prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture , a legal term that means it 's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in @entity1 's murder
as the trial for the death of @entity1 neared , lawyers began arguing about evidence , including cell phones and text messages
some rulings were victories for the defense
the jury would n't see the text @entity1 sent to his sister , telling her he was with " @entity12
" the judge ruled it hearsay and said the state had n't proven @entity1 believed his life was in danger
jurors also did n't hear anything about what happened in @entity221 on july 16 , 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where @entity11 had been
the judge agreed with defense lawyers that it 's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to @entity1 's murder
investigators allege @entity11 shot and killed @entity229 and @entity230 because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink
district attorney @entity235 described the scene in a @entity5 courtroom in may , saying @entity11 became " angered and increasingly agitated , particularly after mr. @entity229 smiled and did not apologize
" prosecutors : bump , spilled drink led to double homicide @entity11 's friend tried to calm him down , and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street , the prosecutor said
court documents identify that friend as @entity248 , who would go on to accuse @entity11 of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later
after leaving the second nightclub , @entity11 and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where @entity11 removed a revolver from the engine block , @entity235 said
@entity11 began trailing @entity229 , @entity230 and three of their friends in his suv , authorities said
he then pulled up to the victims ' car at a red light and leaned out the driver 's side window with a loaded revolver , @entity235 told the court
@entity11 allegedly said , " @entity272 , what 's up now , " followed by a racial slur , and fired at least five rounds from a .38 - caliber revolver , @entity235 said
@entity229 , the driver , was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest
@entity230 was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including one to the head , @entity235 said
@entity11 was charged in the double homicide in may , and he pleaded not guilty
investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of @entity1
@entity2 's @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .
