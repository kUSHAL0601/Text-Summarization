if you 're famous and performing the @entity2 national anthem , be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace
just ask @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12
@entity14 's @entity13 reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling " @entity17
" sure , he can shred it on " @entity19 " and " @entity20 , " but this is a different story -- a completely different story
to say @entity13 butchered the song before the @entity24 game would be unkind to those in the profession
there 's less carnage when butchers are done with their work
the late @entity9 set the modern standard for the national anthem at @entity33
in the early stages of the @entity35 in 1991 , a patriotic @entity2 saluted her performance
just six months earlier , comedian @entity37 may have established the low - water mark
the crowd at the @entity41 game booed her rendition and president @entity43 called it " disgraceful
" there 's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down
one of the most controversial and beloved versions of " @entity17 " comes from 1969
guitar slinger @entity11 inflamed mainstream @entity2 with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the @entity53 generation
and then there 's @entity56 's version
overly wrought songs are his specialty and he does n't disappoint in that department when he sings at the @entity60 in 2003
@entity62 belts it out , but there 's one little problem -- the words
can anyone say crib notes ?
