the bored teenager who gunned down a college baseball player in @entity3 simply because he and his two friends " had nothing to do , " is now a convicted murderer
@entity6 was found guilty of first - degree murder friday for his role in the august 2013 drive - by shooting of @entity10 , a 23 - year - old college student in @entity11 , about 80 miles south of @entity12
@entity6 was 16 at the time of the shooting
@entity10 , an @entity16 attending @entity15 , was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by @entity6
a jury recommended friday that @entity6 spend life in prison without the possibility of parole , according to court records
because he was under 18 when the crime was committed , he is not eligible for the death penalty
he 'll be formally sentenced in june
the vehicle 's driver , @entity27 , pleaded guilty in march to second - degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison
@entity27 , who was 17 at the time of the murder , will be eligible for parole starting in 2051 , according to the @entity34
prosecutors dropped first - degree murder charges filed against the third suspect , then only 15 , after he agreed to testify against @entity6 and @entity38 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity39
he will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact
@entity11 police chief @entity44 told @entity16 radio station @entity46 that when police arrested the teens , @entity27 offered a motive that made clear that @entity10 , a baseball player on scholarship , was chosen at random
" we were bored and did n't have anything to do , so we decided to kill somebody
" after the verdict , @entity6 appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs , whimpering " i 'm sorry " to a reporter
