@entity4 , @entity5 the sign painted onto the school entrance wall reads : " youth is a mistake , adulthood is a struggle , old age is a regret
" the black humor of the message provides some light relief for a school that lives in constant fear of a terrorist attack because of what is taught inside its walls
the students ( aged 8 to 14 ) at the @entity21 school in northern @entity5 are getting a so - called " western " education , taking lessons in subjects like mathematics , science and @entity27
but it 's an education that @entity29 -- the @entity30 - based terror group -- is trying to prevent the children from obtaining , according to the head of the school
" these men , @entity29 , want to make sure everything goes negative , " headmaster @entity34 told @entity6
" they want to make sure they terrify the teachers so they go to their homes -- so the kids in this area do n't get what they deserve
" @entity29 militants have launched a series of deadly attacks over the last few years in the region mostly targeting @entity47
many of the math and science teachers in this area are @entity47
in early april , @entity29 brutally massacred 147 people at @entity53 in northern @entity5
it was the group 's deadliest attack to date
the gunmen would have driven down the road past the @entity21 school -- and its single unarmed guard -- to get to the university , only a few hundred meters away
@entity5 teachers and students alike are terrified
" the @entity63 of @entity4 was the only and first university college in northern @entity5
we were happy when we got it a few years ago , " explained @entity65 governor @entity64
" today it has been closed
that is @entity29 's mission , " @entity64 said
" that is what they want
and that is nothing but destroying the fabric of our being a civilized society
" and it 's not just in @entity5
terrorist groups across the @entity81 region are waging war on schools , teachers and students
in northeast @entity88 , the @entity87 militant group @entity86 has been waging war against the government -- and the civilian population -- for several years
most notoriously , perhaps , was @entity86 's kidnapping of around 270 girls from a boarding school in @entity95 , @entity96 , last april
but the group has also carried out numerous other attacks on schools , slaughtering young boys and girls as they sleep in their dormitories
last year in @entity4 , @entity34 lost five of his 11 teachers amid rising fears of an @entity29 attack on the school
he replaced them , but it was n't easy
yet despite the ever - present threat of terror , @entity34 has stayed to help the children
" i risk my life because -- for this class , there 's a target we have for last year ... and i love that class very much , " @entity34 said
