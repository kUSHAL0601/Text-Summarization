@entity0 and @entity2 are back
an @entity4 reporter went on a regrettable rant
and we all taxed our brains trying to deduce the date of @entity10 's damn birthday
here are pop culture 's most talked - about stories of the week
producers of " @entity14 : the @entity17 " unveiled a nearly two - minute trailer for the upcoming movie , arriving in december
when @entity19 shows up with @entity2 at the end , you can almost hear the @entity22 's collective squeals
a logic problem from a @entity25 math test somehow spread across the @entity26 , leaving millions trying to figure out the hypothetical birthday of someone named @entity10
we 're guessing that most of us cheated and peeked at the answer
who retires at age 34 ? supermodel @entity33 , who walked what she says was her last fashion - show runway this week in her native @entity36
she 'll still keep modeling , though -- and hanging out with her husband , who is apparently a football player of some kind
we all hate having our car towed
but for someone who 's on air at @entity4 , you do n't seem to understand how to behave on camera
speaking of @entity40 , a new book by @entity48 explores how social media may go too far in encouraging haters to shame people who make public missteps
@entity48 told @entity1 , " it 's so corrosive to create that kind of society
" the first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in @entity58 , @entity59
just imagine how fun it 'll be for their parents 16 years from now when they all start dating
fire department , i need you now @entity68 @entity67 of country band @entity69 had to vacate her tour bus when it caught fire outside of @entity74
most of her stuff was burned , but her @entity77 survived
to infinity and beyond famed physicist @entity80 , known for his sense of humor , partnered with the silly lads of @entity84 to recreate the " @entity87 " from their 1983 film " @entity86
" duckie dances ! remember @entity89 from " pretty in @entity90 ? " of course you do
actor @entity92 charmed fans on @entity95 's " @entity94 " by reprising his character 's record - store dance to @entity98 's " @entity99 , " right down to the wall - dancing and counter-bashing .
