@entity0 is a loyal @entity2 and decorated veteran
he was born in @entity4 , a @entity2 territory since 1900
he has been subject to @entity2 law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen
the @entity8 declares that " all persons born ... in the @entity2 , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the @entity2
" yet , @entity0 has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen
how can it be , in the 21st century , that @entity2 born on @entity2 soil are denied the rights of citizenship ? that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of @entity4 to join the @entity2
it is a wrong that @entity0 and other @entity4 are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the @entity26
a decision could come any day
since the @entity2 was established , it adhered to the rule that those born on @entity2 lands were @entity2 citizens
the rule is colorblind , yet the only exception that the @entity35 has ever declared was not
the infamous dred scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free african - americans had " no rights that the white man was bound to respect
" though they were @entity2 , they were not citizens under the @entity7
a @entity44 later , the @entity8 reversed the ruling in the @entity36 case
today , the @entity36 case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the @entity35
but racial discrimination did n't end there
in 1904 , a @entity53 woman named @entity54 sailed for @entity55
because @entity53 was @entity2 territory , she believed herself to be a @entity2 citizen
but officials at @entity58 labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland
she sued , with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling
yet the @entity35 that eventually heard @entity54 's case was still racist
in preceding years , for example , it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the @entity69 race
and , in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as @entity53 , the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second - class @entity2 territories
justice @entity80 's opinion stated that @entity2 sovereignty extended over them , but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other @entity2
he did so , he privately revealed , because " he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions
" in the @entity54 case , the justices agreed unanimously that @entity53 were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws
but they declined to decide whether or not @entity54 was a citizen
though preoccupied by fears that islanders were " savages " and racially unfit for citizenship , they were unwilling to violate the @entity7
as a result of the court ruling , federal officials were able to deny @entity54 and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years
as @entity54 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of @entity2 's island territories are not @entity2 citizens would mean adding to " precedents in our history of which we are least proud
" those precedents , he warned the court , had been " repudiated by the @entity2 people in the @entity44 , by three amendments to the @entity7 , by this court , and by ... advancing civilization
" surely , 147 years after the dred scott case was overturned , the time has come to put an end to this farce
in the past century , the inhabitants of every other @entity2 island territory have become citizens
today , @entity0 and his fellow @entity4 are the last @entity2 still waiting to become citizens .
