a longtime friend of @entity2 has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer - songwriter 's conservator
@entity2 , who was inducted into the @entity6 in 1997 , was taken to @entity7 a month ago after being found unconscious in her home
she remains at the hospital , according to @entity13 ' court petition filed april 28
@entity13 is described as @entity2 's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents
whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion
in her april 28 petition , @entity13 says @entity2 is unconscious : " at this time she ( @entity2 ) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses , and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs
" but on @entity2 's website , a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by @entity13 says @entity2 is alert
" contrary to rumors circulating on the @entity29 today , @entity2 is not in a coma
@entity2 is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends , she 's alert , and she has her full senses
a full recovery is expected
the document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend @entity13 the authority -- in the absence of 24 - hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for @entity2 once she leaves the hospital
" when asked about the discrepancy between statements about @entity2 's health on her website and in the legal filing , her publicist , @entity43 , responded that " the website " was accurate
a doctor 's capacity declaration stated that @entity2 will likely be unable , due to her medical condition , to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months
adoring fans are posting their tributes to @entity2 at @entity57
@entity58 and @entity59 contributed to this report .
