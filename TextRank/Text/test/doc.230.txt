he was impressively polite and bright in the eyes of his boyhood teachers , an encourager of his college friends
he was a docile captured killer in the care of paramedics tending to his gunshot wounds
@entity11 's defense team is seeking to spare him from a death sentence for his part two years ago in the @entity15 bombings and murder of an @entity18 police officer
having focused on his dead older brother , portraying @entity21 as harsh , overbearing and bent on jihad , they now shift to the younger brother who tagged after him , as one witness said , " like a puppy
" the sentencing phase of the federal case will resume monday
the jury was sent home thursday because a juror was sick
@entity11 was convicted april 8 on all 30 counts , including 17 that carry a possible death penalty
the defense 's transition from one brother to the other begins in the ambulances that rushed the brothers from their respective final showdowns with police in @entity43 , @entity44 , on april 19 , 2013
@entity15 bombing survivor : i am not limiting myself @entity21 , dying from gunshot wounds and having been run over by the car his brother was driving as he fled , became combative in the ambulance
a paramedic testified wednesday that it was common for patients in shock to become agitated and fight back
" he had an abdominal wound , it was an evisceration , " said paramedic @entity56
it was a " penetrating wound , " with the intestines protruding
" every time we tried hands - on , he resisted that type of treatment , " @entity56 said
" he was yelling , loud , like an ' rrrrrrrr ' type of thing
it was like he was trying to get out of the seat belts that were holding him on " the stretcher
@entity75 , on the other hand , was cooperative after his capture hours later -- until a tourniquet was applied too tightly , said paramedic @entity78
he responded to questions , giving his date of birth and saying he was allergic to cats
and then he asked a question of his own : " where is my brother ? " the defense showed a series of photographs that demonstrated how the brothers differed in size and age
the younger brother has been portrayed as someone who follows , rather than leads
one of @entity21 's boxing coaches testified earlier that @entity75 followed his brother around " like a puppy
" the defense asserts that the @entity15 bombings never would have happened if it were n't for @entity21
they have portrayed him as obsessed with jihad , spending hours in his computer trolling @entity107 - style websites
an uncle in @entity109 told the @entity110 that @entity21 came there in 2012 , expecting to find " jihad in the streets
" @entity113 was questioned by the @entity110 after 40 days in a @entity109 jail
the @entity110 summary report of the interview was read in court
@entity113 said his nephew asked him if he had contacts with people " in the forest , " as locals referred to the jihadists
@entity21 's information came from the @entity126 , but he had surprisingly little knowledge of @entity128 , the uncle told the @entity110
when he asked his nephew why he wanted to go to the forest , he responded that " jihad was necessary today , " @entity113 told the @entity110
" i told him to stop or he would n't make it to the next tree
" @entity75 , on the other hand , was portrayed in the testimony of five of his former teachers as a smart , sweet kid who worked hard and earned good grades
he was " super kind , extremely smart , a very hard worker , really a lovely person , " said @entity141 , his fifth - grade teacher at @entity142
" all the teachers loved him , " said @entity143 , who had @entity75 in her seventh - grade class at @entity145 , a middle school in @entity146 known for setting its students on the path to " full ticket " scholarships to good colleges
" he was one of our top students , and one of our top athletes , " @entity154 said
" he was n't a rebel
if you asked him to do something , he 'd do it
like most middle - schoolers , he 's need a little push , but he needed just one
" but after just a few days in the ninth grade , @entity75 's mother pulled him out of the school and sent him to @entity168 , a large public high school
she was angry that her son had been sent home to change out of his blue pants
" she was very , very angry because he did n't have clean pants that matched the uniform and they did n't have the money , " @entity154 said
" i thought he liked the school , and i did n't think he wanted to go
" @entity154 said she asked @entity75 if she could call his mother
" he flatly said , ' no , do n't call her
' " he made friends in high school , and a core group got together regularly for " bro nights " during their freshman year at the @entity187 , two young women testified
they smiled at @entity11 from with witness stand , but while he seemed generally more animated in court , he maintained his usual flat expression
" he was loyal , fun , laid - back , " said classmate @entity191
she said she had no idea he was listening to jihadi songs or watching @entity107 videos on his laptop
she bowed her head and wiped tears from her eyes as she stepped off the witness stand and took a seat in the audience
@entity202 testified that @entity11 " was private about his family , " and did not discuss politics or religion with her
she said when he spoke about the future he said he planned to transfer to the @entity207 and study marine biology
he was a supportive friend , she added
" he encouraged me to go to art school , " she said
she showed him her sketches , and he thought they were good
" he said i had talent and should n't let it go to waste
i should go to art school and do what made me happy
it made me feel really good , like somebody believed in me , " she said
she ended her testimony with a memory of one of the last times she saw @entity11 and the " bros. " it was march 2013 , during spring break of their sophomore year
they went out to eat and then drove to a spot by the @entity229
" @entity75 went over to his car , and he got a backpack and there were fireworks inside , " she recalled
" he set one up and ignited it
the second one did work
we were all whooping and hollering
@entity75 was jumping through the firework itself
he was being really silly
" she sobbed as court recessed for the day , and her cries could be heard in the hallway outside the courtroom
@entity15 terror attack fast facts @entity1 's @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .
