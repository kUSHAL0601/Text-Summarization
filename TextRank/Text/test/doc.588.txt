it does n't exactly spring to mind when you think of classic food pairings -- old friends such as bacon and eggs or steak and cabernet
but @entity13 's @entity12 and the folks at @entity15 's are teaming up on a beer inspired by ice cream -- salted caramel brownie ice cream , to be precise
" at this time i can confirm that @entity22 are collaborating to raise awareness around issues we are passionate about , and that the results will be delicious , " @entity12 's director of sustainability , @entity19 , said in a statement
both companies have a history of social activism , and the new project will be no different , they say
their release does n't say what the campaign will be all about , but @entity22 's senior global marketing manager @entity36 promises it will be " impactful
" " we 're big fans of @entity12 , their values , and their fun culture , and of course their beer , " he said
" we 're excited for the campaign we 've developed together
" the companies will announce the details later this year , and the beer is set to hit shelves in the fall
new @entity12 and @entity15 's are both what are called " @entity51 , " a certification issued by the private non-profit @entity53 to companies that meet its social , environmental , accountability and transparency standards
new @entity12 supports sustainable agriculture , climate change and other initiatives , while @entity15 's -- now a subsidiary of global conglomerate @entity61 -- stays true to its hippie roots with support for environmental initiatives , fair trade efforts , marriage equality and more
last month , @entity15 's cofounder @entity67 said he 'd be open to the idea of a marijuana - infused ice cream someday , news that set pot fans ablaze
but sadly for beer fans , there 's no talk of a beer - flavored ice cream
