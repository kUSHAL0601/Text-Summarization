the bad news for @entity2 ahead of the @entity3 keeps coming after scores of dead fish appeared in the @entity7 lagoon
with just over a year to go before the city hosts the @entity12 ' rowing and canoe competitions , officials with the legislative assembly of @entity2 monday launched an investigation into the causes of death both in the lagoon and in other lakes and bays in the state in which this phenomenon has occurred
the group will work in partnership with the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) and the @entity25 for the @entity26
officials defended the belief that the latest rains caused a temperature change of the water and the excess of decaying organic matter , which would have led to a black of oxygen , killing the fish
the note released by officials highlighted that the amount of dead fish has generated a bad smell and inconvenience to those who live near the lagoon and all the tourists who flock to the area
last week , newly obtained video from newspaper @entity44 showed a sailor crashing into trash floating on @entity47
the incident took place on february 14 and involved professional sailors @entity51 , 20 , and @entity52 , 35
according to @entity51 , the impact was so great the boat was forced onto its side
@entity2 has pledged to reduce pollution in the notoriously fetid bay , but last month in an interview with the country 's largest sports channel @entity60 , mayor @entity58 admitted that the bay will remain mostly polluted for the games
" the @entity69 are also in a time that has very little rain , then this amount of debris that comes from five municipalities in the metropolitan region , with poor sanitation , is also controllable ... i do not see as a problem for the @entity69 , " said @entity58
last year biologists said rivers leading into the bay contained a superbacteria that is resistant to antibiotics and can cause urinary , gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections
