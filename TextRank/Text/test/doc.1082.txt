saturday 's deadly earthquake in @entity2 was the " big one " experts were waiting for based on the region 's history
earthquakes are a fact of life in the @entity10 country , with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year , geologist and science journalist @entity14 said
with the last major earthquake in 1934 , the concern was not if , but when the next " great " earthquake would hit , said @entity14 , author of the 2014 article , " @entity20 's earthquake nightmare
" in a landlocked country like @entity2 , where infrastructure is fragile to begin with , the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be " much more serious , " @entity14 told @entity1
those fears were realized when a magnitude - 7.8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of @entity20 rocked @entity2 , toppling homes , historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead , authorities said
" this event , while large and tragic , is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from @entity39 almost to @entity40 is an area of major collision between continental plates , " said geological engineer @entity32 with the @entity33 , @entity35 's @entity34
what 's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of @entity20 , which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes
" the population has exploded in several decades , " @entity53 spokesman @entity51 told @entity1
" when you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that is n't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size , that 's when you see the scale of disaster we 're seeing now
" the big unknown is what happens next , now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed , @entity14 said
how will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country , whose single international airport is closed ? how will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed ? if and when landslides start , how will mountainside villages in the @entity81 range fare ? and , will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts ? " the worry now is to get @entity2 up and running again on feet , " @entity14 said
" the monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we do n't sort things out before then
" an earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault , according to the @entity53
stresses in the earth 's outer layer push the sides of the fault together , releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth 's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake
@entity2 is located on a major plate boundary between @entity106 and @entity107 , where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years
those collisions are responsible for the construction of the @entity81 , which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world , said @entity114 , director of @entity116 's @entity115 and @entity117
@entity106 is moving northward into @entity107 at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year , with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the @entity81 every 500 to 1,000 years , said @entity122 , associate professor of geological sciences with the @entity125 's @entity124
the last major earthquake to affect this part of the @entity81 was in the 1500s , and @entity20 was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of saturday 's quake in 1934
a major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking , @entity122 said
the entire area that experienced shaking was in steep , mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard
@entity122 compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in @entity143 , @entity144
the magnitude - 7.9 earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides , many of which blocked roads , slowing response and recovery efforts
the landslides also blocked river valleys , which created significant flood hazard
" we might anticipate a similar situation for @entity2
