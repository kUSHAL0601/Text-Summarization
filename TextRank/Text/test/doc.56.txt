prosperity gospel pastor @entity0 responded recently to critics of his campaign to buy a very pricey @entity4
@entity0 noted in a recent address to his congregants that the devil was attempting to discredit him in regards to his campaign seeking $ 300 from 200,000 people globally to help buy the luxury jet
in a newly posted five - minute clip on @entity14 , the @entity12 - area pastor speaks to his followers at @entity0 , tackling his critics and allegations about tithes , his real name and reports alleging members of having to reveal their @entity23 statuses to come into the church 's sanctuary
" ( the devil thinks ) i got to discredit that man before he starts showing people @entity29 ! " @entity30 preaches to loud applause
" i 'm on my sabbatical , and the enemy 's trying to discredit me , " @entity0 stated
@entity30 is focused in the video on getting his point across and slams critics of his original request by stating to the people gathered , " i never one time came to you and asked you for a dime for this airplane , did i ? " but in march , @entity0 did appeal in a video to " friends from around the world , " soliciting donations to replace his current 1984 @entity48
because of two accidents that occurred in the 31 - year - old plane , @entity30 and his staff have been flying commercial
" the ( critics ) do n't know what we do
that 's why they asked the question , what does a preacher need with an airplane ? if you knew what we did , then you would n't ask that question , " @entity0 said
" just because the world does n't have it , does n't mean that you ca n't
" in march , the ministry 's desire to purchase a @entity4 airplane was met with criticism on social media and was the subject of nationwide media reports
the furor came after a nearly six - minute video was uploaded on the @entity75 website soliciting money for a @entity4 , which sells for a reported $ 65 million
the page featuring the video and information on the fundraiser has been taken down , but those wishing to donate are still able to do so on the church 's gift page
a @entity4 can fly 18 passengers and four crew members , according to @entity86
the jet comes with two @entity89 engines , high - speed internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four - and - a - half - hour commute from @entity93 to @entity94
" the @entity4 is the biggest , fastest , most luxurious , longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far , " according to the site
the project was n't limited to member donations , as the site stated that " we are asking members , partners and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a @entity4
" in the new video , @entity30 claims the church has more than 3 million supporters worldwide who want him to come to where they are
the pastor has said the two incidents involving his old plane -- including one in which a mechanical failure caused the jet to skid off a runway in @entity118 while his wife and their three daughters were aboard -- have shown him it was time to turn to @entity124 for a new airplane
prosperity gospel is a theology that promises wealth and health to those who tithe 10 % of their income to the church
