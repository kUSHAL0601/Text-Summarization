@entity3 , @entity2 @entity1 airstrikes over @entity2 have resumed once again , two days after @entity1 announced the end of its air campaign
the airstrikes thursday targeted rebel @entity11 militant positions in three parts of @entity3 , two @entity2 @entity8 officials said
the attacks lasted four hours
the strikes caused no casualties , but did destroy all three military compounds that were targeted , the officials said
they said @entity1 airstrikes were also targeting @entity11 positions in @entity21 province
on tuesday , @entity1 announced the end of its @entity23 , a nearly month - long air campaign against @entity11 positions
the @entity1 - led coalition said a new initiative was underway , @entity27 , focused on the political process
but less than 24 hours later , after rebel forces attacked a @entity2 military brigade , the airstrikes resumed , security sources in @entity33 said
five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late wednesday , two @entity33 security officials said
they said explosions lasted for about 40 minutes
@entity1 and its coalition partners started pounding @entity11 positions across @entity2 starting on march 26 , hoping to wipe out the @entity42 - allied rebel group that overthrew the @entity2 government and seized power
the @entity1 say they want to restore the @entity2 government -- a key @entity47 ally in the fight against @entity49 -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year
this month , @entity1 officials said airstrikes have degraded @entity11 - controlled military infrastructure , including key buildings in @entity3
the campaign achieved its objectives " by a very good planning , very precise execution , by the courage of our pilots , our sailors , our soldiers , " said @entity65
gen. @entity66 , a @entity1 military spokesman
a senior @entity1 official told @entity4 that the @entity11 agreed to " nearly all demands " of the @entity69
a statement from the @entity71 in @entity72 outlined objectives of the next phase of operations , including protecting civilians , enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance , confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security
ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation , @entity66 said
military action will be taken if needed
@entity11 leader : ' anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming ' on wednesday , @entity11 released @entity2 defense minister @entity90 in @entity3 , a senior @entity1 source said on the condition of anonymity
the @entity11 had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the @entity2 port city of @entity96 on march 26 , shortly before the @entity1 began their airstrike campaign
the rebels had captured the base that day as part of an advance on the @entity96 area
the @entity103 demanded @entity90 's release earlier this month
but beyond the military campaign , the @entity1 and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence - plagued nation
president @entity110 , who says he 's @entity2 's legitimate leader , thanked the @entity1 - led coalition
he is working with the @entity1 and other allies to return to his country
" we promise to restructure the @entity2 military to ensure that it serves the people of @entity2 , " @entity110 said , calling on the @entity11 to withdraw , and saying that he would return to @entity2 at " the right time " to rebuild the country
" you will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military , far from rebel militancy
" why is @entity1 bombing @entity2 ? @entity125 reported from @entity3 ; @entity126 reported and wrote from @entity127
@entity4 's @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .
