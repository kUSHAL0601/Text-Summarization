@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 claimed it controlled part of @entity3 's largest oil refinery sunday , posting images online that purported to show the storming of the facility , fierce clashes and plumes of smoke rising above the contested site
the group said it launched an assault on the @entity16 oil refinery late saturday
by sunday , @entity0 said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but @entity3 government security officials denied that claim and insisted @entity3 forces remain in full control
@entity1 could n't independently verify @entity0 ' claim
it would n't be the first time that militants and @entity3 forces have battled over the refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by @entity3 domestically
if an attack damaged oil fields or machinery , it could have a significant impact
the refinery is just 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from the northern @entity3 city of @entity39 , which @entity3 forces and @entity42 militias wrested from @entity0 less than two weeks ago
@entity1 's @entity43 and @entity44 contributed to this report .
