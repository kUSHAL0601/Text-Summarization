@entity1 silently moving deep beneath the ocean 's surface , combat submarines can employ the element of surprise to carry out devastating attacks on naval fleets and land targets
for decades , the @entity11 military has maintained its dominance in the depths of the world 's oceans by boasting the most technologically advanced submarine fleet
however , officials say @entity18 and other nations are rapidly expanding the size and scope of their own submarine forces
and , according to a report by the @entity24 , the @entity11 must rethink the role of manned submarines and prioritize new underwater detection techniques
" we know they are out experimenting and looking at operating , and clearly want to be in this world of advanced submarines , " vice adm. @entity28 told the @entity30 's sea power subcommittee in february
@entity28 , who is deputy chief of naval operations for capabilities and resources , says @entity18 submarines are still technologically inferior to those used by the @entity11 , but that margin of difference is shrinking
concern that @entity18 could match @entity11 underwater capabilities in the near future has encouraged the development of an unmanned drone ship to independently track enemy ultra-quiet diesel electric submarines over thousands of miles to limit their tactical capacity for surprise
initiated by a @entity52 research group called the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) would be able to operate under with little supervisory control but also as remotely controlled or piloted vessels , depending on the circumstances of specific missions
" we 're looking for test - ready , multi-sensor approaches that push the boundaries of today 's automated sensing systems for unmanned surface vessels , " said @entity58 , @entity53 program manager
" enhancing the ability of these kinds of vessels to sense their environment in all weather and traffic conditions , day or night , would significantly advance our ability to conduct a range of military missions
" @entity53 says the so - called drone ships will be 132 feet long and likely cost about $ 20 million , significantly less than the billion - dollar manned warships currently in use
the development of the @entity50 aligns with the " culture change " described by navy secretary @entity79 tuesday at the @entity81 's @entity80 at @entity82 , @entity83
" unmanned systems , particularly autonomous ones , have to be the new normal in ever - increasing areas , " @entity84 said
@entity84 said new staff will be put into place to help streamline , coordinate and champion unmanned systems in " all domains
" an @entity50 prototype vessel is already in production and , if testing is successful , the @entity81 could move to the next phase of development by 2018 .
