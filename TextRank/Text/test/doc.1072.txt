police in the @entity5 city of @entity6 , in the western state of @entity1 , are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : cattle
following a recent state - wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ' mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police
along with the photograph , the residents have to give information about their animal 's ' unique features , ' such as the coloring and age of the cow , along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics
police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law
cows are considered holy and revered by that state 's majority @entity40 population
" we are creating a database
if we get an information of a cow slaughter , we can quickly go to the resident 's place and check whether it is there or not " , @entity51 , deputy superintendent of malegaon police told @entity3
" i believe this will be very effective " so far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed
the ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in @entity6 , where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat
the @entity66 now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses
even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years
the slaughter of buffaloes , however , is still permissible
however , beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month - long strike , which ended wednesday
the traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat
they have now vowed to file a case in the state 's high court
red meat lovers were n't too delighted either , arguing the government does n't have a right to interfere in an individual 's personal preference
@entity1 is not the only @entity5 state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter
@entity100 state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison , the toughest penalty in the country
@entity105 , @entity5 's home minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country - wide law against cow slaughter .
