@entity2 's " @entity1 " is about to make history
" @entity10 " — the final film from the late @entity12 — is expected to gross $ 115 million or more when opening at the @entity9 box office this weekend , the top showing ever for an april title , not accounting for @entity7 , it is getting the widest release in @entity2 's history with a theater count of roughly 4,003 ( including @entity17 locations ) , eclipsing " @entity18 " ( 3,956 )
anything north of 4,000 is usually reserved for summer tentpoles and year - end titles
overseas , the movie is also poised to do massive business , putting its global debut north of $ 250 million
" @entity1 " is opening day - and - date around the world on 10,500 screens in 63 territories , save for a few major markets including @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31
@entity34 : ' furious 7 ' scores @entity33 release despite @entity37 contract dispute the current record - holder for top april opening domestically is " @entity40 : the winter soldier , " which debuted to $ 95 million from 3,928 theaters last year
" @entity10 " is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date
and if it beats the $ 121.9 million launch of " @entity46 : @entity47 — part 1 " in november 2014 , it will mark the largest three - day opening since " @entity46 : catching @entity51 " ( $ 158 million ) in november 2013
the movie enjoys massive awareness and interest , due to both the popularity of the street - racing series and @entity12 's death
the last film , " @entity58 , " debuted to a franchise - best $ 117 million over the four - day @entity60 weekend in 2012 , including $ 97.4 million for the three days , on its way to grossing $ 788.7 million worldwide
@entity2 intended to open " @entity1 " on july 11 , 2014 , but production was halted in november 2013 when @entity12 died in a car crash during the @entity65 hiatus
after director @entity68 , writer @entity67 and @entity2 pored over existing footage and tweaked the script , production resumed in april 2014
@entity34 : studio profitability report - who 's up and who 's down @entity75 and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring @entity12 's detective character , @entity77 , with @entity12 's brothers , @entity79 and @entity80 , used as stand - ins
" @entity10 " pits @entity83 's @entity82 and crew ( which includes @entity86 and @entity87 , among others , as well as @entity12 ) against @entity90 's @entity89 , out for revenge after the death of his brother
" @entity10 " is expected to usher in a string of mega-openings at the box office this year
@entity97 and @entity99 's " @entity98 : age of @entity101 , " set to open may 1 , has n't come on tracking yet , but some forecasters are already suggesting it could score the top opening of all time domestically , eclipsing the record - breaking start of " @entity98 " ( $ 207 million ) in 2012
