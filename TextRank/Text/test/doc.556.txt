by some estimates , about a third of @entity2 use some form of alternative medicine , including homeopathic remedies because they find @entity8 medicine inadequate
creams such as @entity10 for pain relief or liquids such as @entity13 for male virility are part of a $ 2.9 billion business that has seen " explosive growth , " according to the @entity17
these drugs do not go through the same level of scrutiny as over-the - counter and prescription drugs
but now your over-the - counter homeopathic remedies might soon face stricter scrutiny from the federal government
products such as the homeopathic cold remedies @entity29 and @entity31 , among others , came under fire monday from experts who testified at a @entity17 hearing monday
the two - day " listening session , " as the @entity17 calls it , is an opportunity for experts and members of the public to help the @entity17 decide how it should regulate these products
critics say the agency is not doing enough
an analysis of hundreds of published studies from the @entity46 in @entity47 found that homeopathic medicine was no more effective than a placebo
there is no evidence that they actually work , the council claimed , and yet it is a multibillion dollar business
homeopathy is a medical philosophy that essentially believes your body is the best weapon to fight disease
homeopathic medicine is based on the idea that " like cures like , " meaning if something causes a symptom in your body , if you take a diluted form , it will boost your body 's ability to fight it
typically these remedies include a plant or a mineral in a tiny amount
do homeopathic treatments for @entity74 work ? people who represent the industry , such as @entity77 , a member of the @entity78 of @entity79 , argue that the current @entity17 system is a good one and that the products available today are of high quality and label standards are enough
dr. @entity86 testified that most people do n't entirely know what homeopathy is and " may assume that these products are dietary supplements or are conventional drugs " since they are often sold on the same shelves as traditional drugs
this practice is " innately misleading , " said @entity86 , an associate professor in the department of pharmacology and physiology at @entity99
most consumers , she said , do n't know that the @entity17 does n't " routinely review these products for identity , purity , potency , quality or stability prior to marketing
" opinion : alternative healing or quackery ? while many people believe the drugs are safe in large part because they are highly diluted , products such as @entity114 , if taken according to the recommendations on the label , would be 10 times the recommended dietary allowance ( @entity119 ) of zinc for adult females and eight times the recommendation for males , according to @entity86
too much zinc can have toxic effects
more than 130 people using another homeopathic medicine with zinc , @entity31 , reported to the @entity17 that they lost their sense of smell
the @entity17 issued a warning to consumers about it in 2009
there is a misconception that all homeopathic products are " natural " according to the @entity17 " and therefore safe
unfortunately , @entity17 has become aware of significant safety issues associated with homeopathic products in recent years , " according to an email from the agency
other issues include a 2010 @entity17 warning about @entity144 's teething tablets
they also recalled the tablets that had inconsistent amounts of belladonna
larger doses of the substance can be toxic
in 2014 , the @entity17 warned consumers about @entity153 drug products having penicillin or derivatives of penicillin
another expert asking for stricter standards with homeopathic medicine , @entity160 with the @entity161 , said that there should be stricter label standards that better explained what was actually in the homeopathic product
she believed there was a " deceptive illusion of treatment " when people chose these homeopathic options over pharmaceuticals that have been proven to work
a third of @entity2 use alternative medicine a mother and editor of an alternative medicine magazine and website , @entity174 , testified that homeopathic medicine has helped her family over the years
as a writer and editor of health publications , she said she has seen a growing interest in this kind of medicine , and she believes it is is well - placed
she believes people have more trust that consumers do their research before purchasing the product , as she does
she wishes doctors were better versed in this kind of medicine and believes others want " safe , effective and easily accessible " products that are " nontoxic " alternatives to help people feel better
the public hearing will continue tuesday
the @entity17 could make decisions about these labeling and regulation standards some time this year .
