the underwater search area for missing @entity2 looks set to double in size
teams are scouring the depths of a remote part of the southern @entity7 for the remains of the passenger jet that disappeared more than a year ago with 239 people on board
so far , they 've covered about 60 % of the priority search zone without reporting any trace of the airliner
families of passengers and crew members still have no answers about what happened to their loved ones
if the searchers have n't found anything by the time they 've covered the entire 60,000 - square - kilometer priority zone , the search will stretch into a new equally vast area , government officials from @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 announced thursday
" ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board @entity2 , " the three countries said in a joint statement
the search of the current priority zone is expected to be completed in may
covering the new zone could take as long as a year
at that point , " all high probability search areas would have been covered , " the governments said thursday
the size of the doubled search area , the equivalent of more than 46,000 square miles , would be bigger than the @entity50 state of @entity51
flight 370 vanished after taking off from @entity53 , @entity23 , on march 8 , 2014 , bound for @entity54
officials are still trying to figure out why it veered dramatically off course over the sea between @entity23 and @entity58 and where exactly it ended up
an international team of experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern @entity7 , far off the coast of @entity24
the people on board the @entity64 came from various nations , but the majority were @entity25
@entity0 's @entity69 contributed to this report .
