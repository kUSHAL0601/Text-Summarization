it seems @entity2 hold their value pretty well , especially if they have papal connections one that @entity5 once owned just sold for $ 30,500 , according to @entity6 , an auction house in @entity8
the @entity10 tablet had all the personal touches
" @entity15 " and " @entity16 , march 2013 " were engraved on the back in @entity13 and @entity14
it also came with a keyboard and a certificate signed by the @entity5 's personal secretary
the proceeds will go to a school in @entity23 , @entity8
it 's not the first time a papal hand - me - down has gone for big bucks
last year , the @entity5 donated a @entity28 that he was given to charity
the motorcycle sold for $ 284,000 at auction , more than 10 times its normal sales price
a @entity28 motorcycle jacket signed by @entity5 sold for nearly $ 68,000
@entity1 's @entity34 contributed to this report .
