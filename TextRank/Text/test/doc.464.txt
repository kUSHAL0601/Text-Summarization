@entity0 suspended reporter @entity2 for a week after a video of her berating a towing company employee surfaced thursday
the sports network announced her suspension on @entity7
@entity8 posted an apology on @entity7 , saying she allowed her emotions to get away from her during a stressful situation at a @entity14 business
" i ... said some insulting and regrettable things
" " as frustrated as i was , i should always choose to be respectful and take the high road
i am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake , " she wrote
on the roughly one - minute long video that was captured by a surveillance camera , @entity8 says to an employee at a register : " i 'm in the news , sweetheart
i will ( expletive ) sue this place
" the employee tells @entity8 she 's being recorded , but it does n't stop her from continuing her rant
" that 's why i have a degree and you do n't , " she says
" i would n't work at a scumbag place like this
makes my skin crawl even being here
" later @entity8 says , " maybe if i was missing some teeth they would hire me , huh ? " the employee apparently says something about @entity8 's hair and the color of her roots
@entity8 sasses back , saying , " oh , like yours , ' cause they look so stunning , ' cause i 'm on television and you 're in a ( expletive ) trailer , honey
lose some weight , baby girl
" @entity1 reached out to the @entity52 towing company for comment but did n't hear immediately back
the edited video was first posted on the website @entity56 , which said the incident occurred april 5
the video inspired the @entity7 hashtag # firebrittmchenry
the reporter is one of several @entity0 on - air talents to be suspended in the past 12 months
in february , anchor @entity62 was not on the air for most of a week after a @entity7 spat that the anchor had with fans of @entity67
@entity68 was suspended in september for three weeks for calling @entity70 commissioner @entity69 a liar
commentator @entity72 was suspended in july for a week for widely criticized remarks about domestic abuse that referred to possible " provocation " by victims
how @entity8 could have responded @entity8 is based in @entity77 and the incident happened across the @entity79 in @entity52
@entity8 joined @entity0 in 2014
at the time of her hiring , @entity0 's senior vice president and director of news , @entity85 , praised her knack for getting interviews with major sports celebrities
" in a relatively short time , @entity2 has established a reputation for strong , aggressive reporting in the @entity77 area , and an ability to land big interviews , " said @entity89
" her presence there will be a great benefit to @entity0 's newsgathering and , as with all of our bureau reporters , she will be assigned to high - profile stories around the country
" before @entity0 , she was with @entity103 in @entity77
@entity8 joined the station in 2008 and the sports staff in 2010
she went to @entity106 as an undergraduate and @entity108 for graduate studies in journalism
opinion : who 's worse : @entity2 , or us ?
