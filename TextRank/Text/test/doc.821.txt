about 20 hours after the @entity1 started monday , many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared
but one man , despite the odds against him , crossed the finish line
@entity9 native @entity8 , who is battling muscular dystrophy , completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. tuesday
a group of energized fans rallied for the 39 - year - old as he walked down @entity14 in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation , @entity18
he was the last participant to complete the race , @entity0 affiliate @entity19 reported
friends who were waiting for @entity8 to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated
" he wants to show that life is great , no matter how many problems you can have , " friend @entity26 said
@entity8 was born with muscular dystrophy , which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body
as the disease progresses , people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking
@entity8 has completed marathons in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45
@entity46 has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby , @entity19 said
his perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line tuesday morning , and also by fans online
@entity8 is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year 's marathon , which comes less than two weeks after a jury found @entity59 guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 @entity46 bombings
on social media monday , spectators cheered for runners and the city , calling the marathon a symbol of strength and unity .
