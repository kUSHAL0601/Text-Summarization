by the elation online and in the streets , you 'd think @entity0 had just won the @entity5
@entity0 erupted in celebration as young people waved flags from their sunroofs , blasted music from stereos and chatted online with the hashtag # @entity13
the excitement came after a breakthrough nuclear deal with the @entity17 and other world powers that promises to end @entity0 's international isolation under years of crippling sanctions
just before midnight on thursday , @entity21 , one of @entity24 's main thoroughfares , turned into something like a block party
men danced in the middle of traffic
some people flaunted @entity17 dollar bills
it was a fitting double occasion : the agreement was struck on the final day of @entity36 festivities , symbolizing a fresh start
@entity38 , a 20 - year - old university student among the crowds , told @entity4 he was happy about the accord but wary about his own future
" i still believe i 'll have a hard time finding a job that pays well , with or without this deal
" another @entity24 resident , @entity45 , 37 , said " things ca n't get worse than they are so , i 'm happy with this news
" " this is pretty historic and i pray that my children will be able to live in an @entity0 that can play nice with the international community
" at home that evening , families watched as @entity0 state television broadcast @entity17 president @entity54 's speech live , which came for many as a surprise
some @entity0 celebrated the moment by snapping selfies in front of the tv
@entity0 foreign minister @entity62 — who led the @entity0 negotiation team — received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in @entity0 on a sunny friday morning
" long live @entity62 , " crowds chanted as the vehicle rolled slowly down the packed street , carrying the man who struck the historic deal
other videos posted to social media showed @entity62 mobbed by fans in @entity74 , who yelled " we love you , @entity62 ! " @entity77 : @entity62 joins @entity0 students cheer " @entity79 " outside press conference at # @entity13

@entity86 , @entity36 , @entity87
# @entity13 pic.twitter.com / @entity88 she closely followed the reaction from @entity0 around the world and told @entity4 she saw an " explosion " of joy when the deal was finally struck
" i did n't expect so many people to follow it so closely , but from the result , i can tell everyone was following
" " after 35 years of animosity , @entity17 and @entity0 diplomats shook hands and stood by each other in public ... everything is just pushing this forward
