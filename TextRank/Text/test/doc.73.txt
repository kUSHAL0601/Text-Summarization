tobacco companies including @entity1 and @entity2 filed suit this week against the @entity4 alleging that the @entity4 is violating the companies ' free speech rights
in march , the @entity4 issued guidance that if significant changes are made to a product 's label , like color or a logo , the product requires new approval from the administration
this holds true even if the product was previously approved
the suit , filed in @entity19 in @entity20 , argues that those guidelines go too far and are too vague
they violate the @entity23 because they pre-emptively restrict free speech and exceed the scope of the @entity26 , the companies claim
the @entity4 's actions , the suit says , do not advance a substantial government interest
the plaintiffs also include @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 @entity4 spokesman @entity34 said the administration does not comment on litigation
@entity0 's @entity37 contributed to this report .
