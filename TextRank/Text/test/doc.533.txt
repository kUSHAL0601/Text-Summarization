it would be easy to laugh off @entity3 's prediction that his film " @entity4 " will win an @entity5 next year , but not for the reason you might think
after all , the actor was serious when he recently told @entity9 " it will probably win best picture at the @entity5 , unless the @entity5 do n't want to be relevant ever
" but rather than ignore it because it 's a glossy , blockbuster action film , some might argue that the movie goes against type for @entity5 nominated films because the cast is so diverse
" @entity22 " hits theaters friday , months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the @entity5
there were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category , which was dominated by white males
@entity30 filmmaker @entity29 went on to win best director for " birdman
" the lack of diversity was so glaring ( even with the mostly black cast of the movie " @entity39 , " which received a nomination for best picture ) that it spurred the @entity41 hashtag " @entity42
" in contrast , " @entity4 " could n't be more racially and ethnically inclusive
the cast includes @entity45 -- a @entity46 / black man -- black actors @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity51 performer @entity50 , @entity53 martial artist @entity52 , @entity55 expatriate @entity54 and the late @entity56 , a blue - eyed , blond - haired @entity58 native
the filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in @entity61 and @entity62 , where key scenes were filmed , found diverse extras
" we were mainly looking for the diverse look of the ( @entity69 ) , " @entity65 , owner of the casting company , told @entity67
" they really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country
" almost since the beginning , the " @entity74 " films have had a diverse focus and appeal
the band of street racers , which encompassed white , black , @entity81 , @entity51 , male and female and bond as a family , has done well at the box office with each iteration
in 2011 , then @entity87 film critic @entity86 wrote , " go on and laugh your @entity88 , @entity90 , @entity91 , quinoa laugh , but it 's true : the most progressive force in @entity95 today is the ' @entity74 ' movies
" " they 're loud , ludicrous , and visually incoherent , " he said
" they 're also the last bunch of movies you 'd expect to see in the same sentence as ' incredibly important
' but they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self - congratulation
( and this does n't even account for the gay tension between the male leads , and the occasional crypto - lesbian make - out
) " according to the @entity117 's @entity116 , while @entity118 make up 17 % of the @entity120 population they account for 25 % of frequent moviegoers
likewise , women make up 52 % of moviegoers
@entity123 points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in @entity95
" despite the films ' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $ 2.4 billion , their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier ; @entity120 movies are still overwhelmingly white , " @entity123 's @entity132 writes
" according to @entity135 's 2015 @entity134 , a mere 16.7 % of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles
" at least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort
@entity3 told @entity123 the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film , which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other
" it does n't matter what nationality you are , " the star said
" as a member of the audience , you realize you can be a member of that ' family
' that 's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved
