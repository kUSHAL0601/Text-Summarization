@entity1 gov. @entity0 signed a bill on friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable
nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen , @entity0 's office said in a press release
@entity2 affiliate @entity16 says it 's never been used in an execution in the @entity18
" the person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later
in other words , a humane , quick and painless death , " said rep. @entity20 , one of the bill 's authors , according to @entity16
@entity25 , executive director of the @entity26 , told the @entity27 that the same " painless " argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections
" the hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which @entity1 has managed its execution process historically , " he said
@entity1 's executions have been put on hold while the @entity18 @entity39 reviews its use of lethal injections
last year , the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer @entity44
@entity0 reaffirmed her support for the death penalty
" @entity1 executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous , " @entity0 said
" i support that policy , and i believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty
the bill i signed today gives the state of @entity1 another death penalty option that meets that standard
" the governor 's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection , followed by nitrogen gas , the electric chair and the firing squad .
