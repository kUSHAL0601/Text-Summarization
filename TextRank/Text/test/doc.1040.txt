@entity1 , @entity4 the @entity1 deputy who shot and killed a man instead of using his taser now faces a manslaughter charge
video shows reserve deputy @entity8 announcing he is going to deploy his taser after an undercover weapons sting on april 2 , but then shooting @entity10 in the back with a handgun
in a written statement , @entity1 district attorney @entity13 said @entity8 is charged with second - degree manslaughter involving culpable negligence
it 's a felony charge that could land the volunteer deputy in prison for up to four years if he 's found guilty
@entity20 , an attorney who represents @entity8 , said the shooting was an " excusable homicide
" " we believe the video itself proves that it was an accident of misfortune that occurred while @entity27 was fulfilling his duties as a reserve deputy , " @entity20 said
" he is not guilty of second - degree manslaughter
" investigators ' efforts to defend @entity8 and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online
@entity10 ' family is demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality
they 're also questioning why the 73 - year - old @entity8 -- the ceo of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high - risk sting operation
@entity47 , an attorney representing the @entity10 family , said @entity8 paid big money to play a cop in his spare time
" it 's absolutely mind boggling that you have a wealthy businessman who 's been essentially deputized to go play like he 's some outlaw , like he 's just cleaning up the streets , " he said
@entity20 said his client -- who had donated cars and video equipment to the @entity60 -- had undergone all the required training and had participated in more than 100 operations with the task force he was working with the day he shot @entity10
but he 'd never been the main deputy in charge of arresting a suspect , @entity20 said , but was thrust into the situation because @entity10 ran from officers during the arrest
" probably in the past four of five years since he has been working in conjunction with the task force he has been on , ( there were ) in excess of 100 operations or search warrants where he was placed on the outer perimeter , " @entity20 said
" he has never been on an arrest team or been the one who is primarily responsible for the capture or the arrest of a suspect
he is there more in a support mechanism
" @entity8 , who worked as a police officer for a year in the 1960s , had been a reserve deputy since 2008 , with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience , according to the @entity60
he was also a frequent contributor to the @entity90 , including $ 2,500 to the reelection of sheriff @entity92
@entity94 's maj. @entity93 denied accusations that @entity8 had paid to play a cop , describing him as one of many volunteers in the community who have contributed to the agency
" no matter how you cut it up , deputy @entity8 met all the criteria on the @entity104 to be in the role that he was in , " @entity93 said
after the shooting , @entity8 told investigators that he was " in a state of shock and disbelief " after realizing he 'd fired his gun
he also said he believed there was a " strong possibility " that @entity10 had a gun
@entity20 said monday that @entity8 is upset over the shooting
" obviously he is very upset about what happened
he feels badly , " he said
" the incident completely took him by surprise
he has all the requisite training
he is @entity118 - certified , and if you watch the video you know he was quite shocked when his gun went off
" authorities say @entity8 thought he pulled out his taser but " inadvertently " fired his gun
they 've painted @entity10 as a dangerous , possibly @entity127 - addled illegal gun dealer who had recently sold methamphetamine to undercover police and who fled police that day in such a way as to give the impression that he had a gun in his waistband
though @entity10 was later determined to be unarmed , sgt. @entity137 of the @entity138 , who has been brought in to review the case , excused the behavior of @entity8 and an officer who is heard cursing at @entity10 in the video
@entity93 said @entity8 was the " victim " of something called " slip and capture , " where in a high - stress situation , a person intends to do one thing and instead does something else
it 's a controversial argument that drew sharp criticism online as soon as police started making it
one expert told @entity5 the claim amounts to " junk science
" " it 's not something that 's supported by a testable theory
there 's no peer - reviewed articles that would support this
... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , " said @entity163 , an assistant professor of criminal justice at @entity165
" so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence
" @entity172 told reporters monday that claims his brother was violent and on @entity127 are false
" he was nonviolent , he was peaceful , he was loving , he was caring , and he was my brother that i 'll never see again ' til i see him in heaven , " @entity10 told reporters , accusing the sheriff 's office of trying to persuade him not to hire an attorney and quickly make the case " go away
" he added that the shooting of his brother , who was @entity184 , was n't a racial matter
" i do n't think this is a racial thing
i do n't think this has anything to do with race
it might have a hint there somewhere
... this is simply evil , " @entity172 told reporters monday
" this is a group of people that 's spent a lot of time together , spent money together
... they 've gotten real comfortable with how they do things , which when you 're the law , i guess you feel like you can do things and get away with it and not get exposed
" well , we 've come to expose it
we 've come to pull a mask off the evil
we 've come to shine a light on the darkness
