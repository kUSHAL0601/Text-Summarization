a dress worn by @entity1 as she played @entity2 in " @entity5 " has fetched $ 137,000 at an auction
that 's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for a mere $ 20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out
the outfit , a gray two - piece ensemble , was sold at an auction in @entity14 , @entity15 , on saturday , according to @entity16
it was the most sought after item among roughly 150 pieces of " @entity22 " memorabilia on sale in the auction
they come from the huge collection amassed by @entity25 , who used to work at @entity26
@entity25 said he came across the @entity2 dress in the early 1960s while doing some research at a costume company
" i saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up , because they were throwing it away , " he said , according to @entity30
" i asked if he would sell it to me , " he said
" i had noticed there was a printed label saying @entity41 and ' @entity42 ' was written in ink
" from that savvy purchase , his " @entity22 " collection snowballed
other standout items include a straw hat worn by @entity1 in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by @entity52 as his character , @entity53 , kicks down the door of @entity2 's boudoir
the dress -- a jacket and full skirt ensemble -- was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie , including when @entity2 encounters @entity61 and when she gets attacked in the shanty town
the outfit has suffered a little with age , however
when @entity1 wore it in the movie , it was slate blue - gray
over the years , it 's faded to light gray
but that did n't deter the winning bidder on saturday .
