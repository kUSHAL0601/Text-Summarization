the @entity0 could soon refer to the hue of @entity4 's lawns
gov. @entity5 on wednesday imposed mandatory water restrictions for the first time on residents , businesses and farms , ordering cities and towns in the drought - ravaged state to reduce usage by 25 %
" we 're in a new era , " @entity5 said
" the idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day , that 's going to be a thing of the past
" the 25 % cut in usage amounts to roughly 1.5 million acre - feet of water ( an acre foot of water equals about 325,000 gallons ) over the next nine months , state officials said
" this historic drought demands unprecedented action , " @entity5 said , standing on a patch of dry , brown grass in the @entity34 mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow
the reduction in water use does not apply to the agriculture industry , except for the requirement that it report more information on its groundwater use
the exclusion prompted some criticism , as agriculture uses about 80 % of @entity4 's developed water supply
farms in the state have taken a hit , with reduced water allocations and thousands of farmworkers laid off
but climate writer @entity53 of @entity54 wrote that " wasteful agriculture is literally sucking @entity4 dry
" the action comes as the @entity34 snowpack , which @entity4 rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs , is near a record low
one famed golf course group said it should be able to keep its fairways and greens green
@entity64 , an executive vice president of the @entity66 company , said his company is studying the restrictions to see what effect it will have on business
" it will not affect our golf course irrigation because we use recycled waste water ( for golf course irrigation ) from a plant we built in 1994 , " he said
the company operates @entity78 , @entity79 and the links at @entity81 as well as three hotels
he said the drought has yet to hurt revenue
" people up here are also very conscious about water usage and the expense of water in this area , " he said
@entity91 in @entity92 , known for its beautiful campus , said it would be challenging to meet the restrictions given the water - saving practices already in effect
the school already uses recycled and reclaimed water for campus irrigation and now it has turned off all fountains on campus , according to @entity102 , director of the university 's @entity103
the university was also encouraging students to further reduce water usage
in addition , @entity5 's executive order will : impose significant cuts in water use on campuses , golf courses , cemeteries and other large landscapes
replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with " drought - tolerant landscaping
" create a temporary , statewide consumer rebate program to replace old appliances with water efficient models
prohibit new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless water - efficient drip irrigation systems are used
@entity126 watering of ornamental grass on public street medians
require agricultural water users to report more water use information to state regulators , increasing the state 's ability to enforce against illegal diversions and waste
" it 's a different world , " @entity5 said wednesday
" we have to act differently
" a staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for @entity4 to recover from the emergency
the estimate is based on @entity142 satellite data analysis of how much water the state 's reserves lack
that 's more than 14,000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the @entity151 stadium , according to @entity1 calculations
it 's the amount of water that flows over @entity155 in about 170 days ' time
the entire state faces at least a moderate drought , and more than half of the state faces the worst category of dryness , called an exceptional drought , according to the @entity164
@entity4 is n't the only state feeling an absence of rain
as of late september , 30 % of the @entity168 faced at least a moderate drought , particularly in the @entity171 states neighboring @entity4 and in @entity172 , the @entity164 says
but none of those states is facing the extremes of @entity4 , where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012
in fact , @entity5 last year declared a state emergency , saying his constituents are facing " perhaps the worst drought that @entity4 has ever seen since records ( began ) about 100 years ago
" opinion : the end of the @entity185 lawn on september 16 , @entity5 signed " historic legislation " that created " a framework for sustainable , local groundwater management for the first time in @entity4 history , " the governor 's office said
before the new legislation , @entity4 was the only @entity195 state that did n't manage its groundwater , officials said
last month , @entity5 unveiled an emergency $ 1 billion spending plan to tackle the state 's historic drought
according to the @entity201 , the package will specifically accelerate $ 128 million from the governor 's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities
@entity208 1 funding , which enacted the @entity209 , @entity210 , and @entity211 of 2014 , will funnel $ 272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure
some $ 660 million from @entity215 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas
as part of the changes , @entity5 said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as @entity4 enters the fourth year of a worsening water crisis
the march snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the march 3 historical average for the measurement site
the overall water content for the @entity230 snowpack came in at 4.4 inches , just 16 % of average for the date
@entity234 and southern @entity235 readings were 5.5 inches ( 20 % of average ) and 5 inches ( 22 % of average ) respectively
only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower
@entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this report .
