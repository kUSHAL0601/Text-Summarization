@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 has come to @entity2
after months of turmoil and upheaval , months of frustration and anger , the beleaguered city has a new governing board
and it looks very different than the old one
buoyed by a higher - than - normal 30 % turnout , two @entity12 candidates won their wards tuesday night to make the six - member @entity16 50 % black
@entity2 's population of about 21,000 is 70 % black , but the @entity16 was predominantly white , as is the police force
supporters of both candidates said that from the tragedy of a young black man 's death , a new day dawned in @entity2
@entity25 screamed when her victory became official late tuesday night
she won 49.76 % of the vote
" thank you , @entity29 1
i love you , " an emotional @entity30 said at a party held at @entity33 's restaurant
she will become the first black woman ever to sit on the @entity2 council
but both @entity30 and @entity37 , who won the @entity29 seat with nearly 67 % of the vote , said they did not see their victories from a racial perspective
@entity30 , who resigned her job as a @entity45 cosmetics sales director to run for office , said in her ward , she heard the same complaints from a 65 - year - old black man as she did from his white peers
" my job is to be that catalyst so we can put a new face on @entity2 , " she said
@entity37 , a lawyer and criminal justice professor , said , " i 'm more interested in having quality on the council , " when asked about the change in its racial makeup
he had made community policing his no. 1 priority and said he intends to be deeply involved with the hiring of a new police chief in this @entity65 suburb
the former chief , @entity66 , resigned after a scathing @entity69 @entity68 report found systemic discrimination against african - americans in law enforcement and the municipal court
@entity37 said he wants @entity2 's police officers to be judged by the number of people they know in the community , not by the number of tickets they issue
one other seat was up for grabs in @entity2
that was won by @entity84 , a former mayor who launched the " @entity91 " campaign to raise money for mom - and - pop businesses that were hurt by the violence and vandalism during the protests last fall
@entity84 beat his opponent , @entity92 , with 56.7 % of the vote
@entity84 told voters he was best suited for a @entity16 job despite his critics ' claims that he was too entrenched in the old guard
" i understand that feeling , but those individuals do n't know me , " he said
@entity84 said he had contacts with elected officials from his almost three decades in politics
that would be an invaluable asset in getting @entity2 back on its feet , he said
the city is required to approve a new budget by the end of june , and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $ 3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines
" that amount will drop significantly , " @entity84 said
earlier in the day , the skies grew dark and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods
amid the rain , @entity2 opened its polls at 6 in the morning with concern that few would come out to vote in such a pivotal election
it was the first city election since white police officer @entity128 shot and killed unarmed black teenager @entity129 in august
there was dread , especially in the @entity12 - @entity69 community , that if the turnout was low , then all the protests , investigations and calls for change would have been in vain
the candidates who had run campaigns calling for change hoped a decent turnout would weigh in their favor
" that is what our democracy about , " @entity37 said
@entity37 ran against @entity147 , a retired electrical plant employee , in @entity148 , which includes @entity150 , where @entity129 was killed , and the @entity152 business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism
charred , heavily damaged buildings still stand as scars of @entity2 's despair and anger
" you got your vote on ? " yelled @entity160 , a @entity37 supporter who was distributing campaign literature at @entity162 , the precinct closest to where @entity129 lived
some residents did have their vote on
they felt a duty to vote this year
one of them was @entity170 , 41 , who works as a planner for @entity172
yes , she voted in presidential elections , but she never paid much mind to local races
even though she was aware of the problems around her , @entity129 's killing , she said , woke her up
" it made me think of all the males in my family , " said @entity170 , who lives right off @entity150
she was undecided about who to vote for until the last minute when she walked into the polling station with another voter and they discussed the race
@entity170 decided to cast her vote for @entity37 simply because he was a young man
she thought he had energy and was more in sync with @entity2 's youth
" i think he will be more open - minded , " she said after voting
changing the way @entity2 polices its people was no. 1 on many a voter 's agenda
even the candidates who take issue with the @entity68 report on @entity2 agreed that the city needed change when it came to policing
" we have to get out of this law enforcement for business , " said candidate @entity203 , coordinator of the computer network security program at @entity205
@entity203 referred to the @entity68 's finding that @entity2 issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city
" that 's not a good thing , " @entity203 said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided
@entity217 , a 67 - year - old retired airline pilot , said he voted for @entity84
if some residents saw @entity84 as part of the problem , @entity217 asked why no one complained when @entity84 was mayor
he said @entity129 's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light
" we did n't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people , " he said
" some things need to be changed , and we are aware of that
" by midafternoon , @entity84 said the numbers were looking good
at a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots , @entity84 predicted a 40 % -50 % turnout
when the rain let up for a few minutes , a stream of voters trickled into the @entity242 in downtown @entity2 to cast their votes
@entity244 and @entity245 both voted for @entity84 's opponent , @entity92 , a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines
@entity92 likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son
" i wanted change , " said @entity255 , 60 , who is black
he said the couple moved to @entity2 after he retired from the @entity259 in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place
but now , after all the problems rose to the surface , it 's time for fresh blood on the council , @entity255 said
" quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream , " @entity255 said
" that 's like using the military to go into places and looting them
the police are supposed to keep order
" @entity273 came to vote with her husband and two little girls in tow
she voted for @entity30 , the former @entity45 cosmetics sales director
@entity66 echoed the thoughts of other @entity2 residents who experienced something new in this election : candidates coming to their door
past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks
nor have past municipal elections drawn so much media attention
" one thing we really liked is ( @entity30 ) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood , " @entity66 said
" she 's going to be hands on
she lives in the neighborhood as well and has for the past 36 years
we were kind of taken by that
" the rain began to fall again as the @entity301 got in their car
it was expected to continue off and on through the day and night
but at about 5 , just when many voters were leaving work , the sun shone brilliantly
overheard at one precinct : good weather brought out the worst in @entity2 last august
maybe today , it would bring out the best .
