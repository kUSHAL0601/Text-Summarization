" when asked where he wanted to go , @entity15 responded that , if a person has a chance to join @entity98 and does not go there , on judgment day he will be asked why , and that it is a sin to live in the land of infidels , " the complaint says
" after @entity15 continued to ask for his passport , his mother hung up the phone

... it is better to fool them by flying here and flying there
" there were other recorded conversations
in one from november , @entity15 told @entity14 that he wanted to join the @entity51 military so he could share information with @entity8

in another recorded conversation in january , @entity15 told the informant that if he could n't get travel documents to go to @entity88 , " i will just go and buy a machine gun , @entity125 , go out and shoot all police
" later , according to the complaint , he said , " it is legal in @entity51 to carry a gun
we will go and purchase one handgun ... then go and shoot one police officer

... what happened to him ? he seemed to be a very peaceful person

but is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here ? what i 'm saying is , to shoot @entity172 and then get shot ourselves , will it do ? that will strike fear in the hearts of infidels
" the post earned @entity14 a visit from federal agents several days later
@entity14 admitted that he 'd posted the message and that he believed in the @entity8 agenda
