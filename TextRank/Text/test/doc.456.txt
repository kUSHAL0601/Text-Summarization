@entity1 fighters seized several districts in the @entity5 city of @entity6 in an hours - long assault friday that included suicide and car bombs , an @entity5 provincial official said
at least 10 @entity5 security forces were killed in the attacks , according to @entity13 , the deputy head of @entity5 's @entity15 provincial council
and the head of the @entity5 military operation in @entity15 province , gen. @entity19 , was wounded
the northern @entity6 districts of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 were in the hands of @entity1 by the time the day was done
located about 70 miles ( 110 kilometers ) west of @entity25 , @entity6 has seen intense and persistent fighting for months
@entity1 took over parts of that western @entity15 city in the first half of 2014 , and it 's been part of a tug of war ever since
@entity5 security forces discovered tunnels in february that they say could have led opposition fighters to a central government compound in the city
but they did n't find all of them : a few weeks later , @entity1 detonated hundreds of homemade bombs from a tunnel underneath an army headquarters there , according to @entity43 , the head of the @entity15 provincial council
more than 40 @entity5 soldiers died in that explosion
@entity5 and allied forces have made inroads in recent weeks , beating back the group that calls itself the @entity50 , which took over vast swaths of @entity5 and neighboring @entity52 last year
their most high - profile victory , for instance , was the recapture of @entity56
and @entity58 - led airstrikes have already made a difference , according to officials in @entity61 and beyond
still , @entity1 remains a formidable force and , as the @entity6 assault shows , one that 's still capable and willing to go on offense to take territory
that may be best illustrated by the case of @entity68 , @entity5 's second largest city and the site of one of its biggest embarrassments when @entity5 soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts as @entity1 forces advanced last june
a @entity58 official said in february that up to 25,000 @entity5 troops were expected to return to the key northern @entity5 city in april or may
but , on thursday , a senior official in @entity58 president @entity82 's administration appeared to back away from that timeline -- saying an @entity5 - led assault on @entity68 " might be some time from now ( or ) might be soon
" calling for " patience , " an administration official said that winning @entity68 is a complex endeavor
the same could be said for the entire effort to defeat @entity1
it will " take a lot of capacity , " the official said , " and some time to build
" @entity2 's @entity93 contributed to this report .
