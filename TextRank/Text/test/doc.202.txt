about 150,000 years ago -- give or take 20,000 -- a guy fell into a well
last month he made science history
the @entity4 became the oldest @entity5 to have his dna extracted by researchers
it took them more than 20 years to get around to doing it
scientists in southern @entity12 have known about him since 1993 , when spelunkers spied his skull staring blankly back at them from its nook in the @entity21 cave , deep under the town of @entity23
the cave explorers told researchers at the @entity26 what they 'd found , according to their report published in march in the @entity29 and @entity30
@entity4 's intact skull and jumbled pile of bones made for a great specimen , but they were wedged into a panoply of stalactites and stony globules deposited by water dripping over them for tens of thousands of years
researchers decided not to rescue the bones for fear that trying to ease them out of the cave 's calcified grip would shatter them and ruin @entity4
so , they left him forever a cave man
@entity46 pebbles line the @entity5 's eye sockets , nose bone and an upper jaw like a hundred decorative piercings
analysis of the calcite has shown the bones to be 128,000 to 187,000 years old
scientists believe @entity4 wound up in the cave at least that long ago after falling into a prehistoric well , then died in the caverns at its bottom of thirst or hunger
recently , researchers made an exception , and toted off a chip from his right shoulder blade to the lab. metrics taken of his skeleton confirm @entity4 was a homo neanderthalensis
he will spend perhaps endless eons glaring silently out of his cranny in the world 's most secluded spot , or , as @entity23 's archeological museum describes it , " in the corner of a small cavity situated between the ground and the back wall
" the scientists hope they will be able to sequence his dna , to find out more about the evolution of all hominids -- including us
and to hear some of @entity4 's story about life in @entity5 ' early days in @entity87 , before he happened to stumble into that darned hole .
