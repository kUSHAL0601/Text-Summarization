@entity2 , @entity3 the desks of the small @entity1 are empty
its 573 students , all male , are staying home after @entity3 president @entity9 announced three days of national mourning following last week 's deadly attack at a nearby university
only a few kilometers away , 147 people -- mostly students -- were brutally massacred when @entity15 militants invaded the campus in @entity2 , a town in northeastern @entity3
we 've come to this particular @entity19 religious school because the man suspected by @entity3 authorities of being the " mastermind " behind the atrocity -- @entity24 -- once taught here
" he was someone who was very quiet , he did n't like too much talk , " recalls sheikh @entity25 , the principal at the @entity1
he says he also taught with @entity28 for two years
" when he left the @entity1 , he joined @entity15
but before , he was normal , just like me and other people
" what worries authorities here is exactly that -- @entity28 was @entity3
but now , say officials , @entity28 is in command of an @entity15 militia based near @entity3 's long , porous border with @entity39 -- about 118 miles ( 190km ) from @entity2 -- who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross-border attacks into @entity3
the @entity43 militant group , who are allied with @entity45 , have been waging a bloody campaign for control of @entity39
with @entity3 troops part of an @entity51 force deployed in support of @entity39 's @entity54 - supported government , @entity3 has now become a target
last year , an attack by @entity15 on a shopping center in the country 's capital , @entity60 , claimed the lives of 68 people
now @entity28 stands accused of being behind thursday 's attack -- the deadliest attack in the nation since @entity45 killed more than 200 people at the @entity67 in @entity60 in 1998
but @entity28 is not @entity3 's only homegrown terrorist
the @entity3 @entity69 has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also @entity3
@entity74 was in his 20s and the son of a government chief
his father says he lost contact with his son in 2013 , shortly after he left university
the @entity3 government is concerned that @entity15 is recruiting disaffected youth from inside the country
" our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities , " president @entity9 said during an address to the nation in the aftermath of the massacre
meanwhile , @entity98 insists his @entity1 has nothing to do with @entity28 's extreme , violent ideas
" this man is a dangerous man , a killer , a criminal , " he says
but he was also once a neighbor
and so @entity3 must now look within to tackle this very real threat to the country 's -- and the region 's -- stability .
