@entity4 the @entity6 is traditionally an event in which people in and around the @entity2 capital come together , celebrate and enjoy
but not in 2013 , when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line
and not this year -- at least not if you 're a member of the jury that convicted @entity15 in the bombings
that 's what federal judge @entity18 told jurors tuesday , stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial 's sentencing phase
that begins april 21 , a day after this year 's edition of the landmark race
" do not attend the @entity6 or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the @entity6 , " @entity18 said in court
the judge spoke for less than 10 minutes , and stressed the seriousness of his warnings
the first phase of @entity15 's trial began march 4 , after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses , and the defense just four
timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath @entity15 's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days - long mayhem that followed
@entity15 lawyer @entity51 acknowledged in opening arguments that : " it was him
" but @entity55 argued that @entity15 only took part in the plot under the influence of his brother @entity59 , who died after the bombings , but before his brother was captured in a boat parked in a @entity63 backyard , that argument was n't enough to sway the jury , though
rather , they convicted @entity15 on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction , bombing a place of public use , conspiracy and aiding and abetting
a look at all of the charges the only question now , short of a successful appeal of that verdict , is what price he 'll now pay
the maximum penalty for several of the charges is death
talking to the jury on tuesday , @entity18 predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather
the plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week , as long as the process takes
until then , @entity18 told the jurors , " please put the case out of your minds
" what 's next for @entity15 ? @entity5 's @entity98 reported from @entity4
@entity5 's @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 contributed to this report .
