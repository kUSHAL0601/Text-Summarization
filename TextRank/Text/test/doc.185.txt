the master of the light , genius @entity1 has passed on
" @entity1 won his @entity2 for his work on the first of the fabled " @entity4 " trilogy , " @entity40 " ( 2001 )
his knack for getting the right feel of author @entity44 's most foreboding locales was remarkable
for the inaugural " @entity4 " film , @entity3 reached out to @entity1 after seeing his work on " @entity47 " ( 1995 ) and its 1998 sequel
those @entity50 films , revolving around a pig and other animals , featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office
" i 'd never worked with him or even met him before , but he 'd shot the @entity47 films and i thought they looked amazing , the way he 'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect , " @entity3 said in a 2004 interview
" and @entity47 had that larger - than - life feel about it that i wanted
" so when we began looking for @entity69 in early 1999 , i first decided to get either an @entity50 or @entity27 @entity70 , as they 'd be used to the way we make films , " @entity3 continued
" every country is slightly different in that way , and i immediately thought of @entity1
" @entity1 's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film " @entity81 " ( 2007 ) , directed by @entity78 and starring @entity79 ; " @entity82 " ( 2010 ) , from @entity83 ; and @entity84 ( 2014 ) , helmed by @entity80
