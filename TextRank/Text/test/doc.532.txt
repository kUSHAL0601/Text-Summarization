are you smarter than a really smart @entity3 high school student ? see if you can figure out @entity6 's birthday , the @entity3 logic problem that 's got the @entity8 twisted into knots
some are even saying it 's the math equivalent of the " what color is the dress " debate
the puzzling problem went viral after @entity3 television host @entity16 posted it to @entity19
@entity6 's birthday challenge was meant to test the better high - school students competing in the @entity3 and @entity22 , held april 8
here it is : @entity6 has a birthday , and she does n't want to share it right away
( otherwise , we have no challenge to solve
) so she gives her friends @entity29 and @entity30 a list of 10 possible birthday dates : may 15 , may 16 , may 19 , june 17 , june 18 , july 14 , july 16 , august 14 , august 15 or august 17
a brief conversation between @entity29 and @entity30 -- who we assume are not lying for the sake of this problem -- gives the reader enough clues to eliminate nine of the 10 dates and discover @entity6 's birthday
that 's assuming you want to celebrate with @entity6 after she 's put you through all that trouble
see our video below for the answer from @entity47 mathematician @entity46
the @entity48 and the @entity49 have also posted solutions to the problem , along with explanations
of course , the @entity8 has offered other solutions .
