a 24 - year - old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance , only to have @entity6 authorities come and discover weapons , ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in @entity14 requested , a top prosecutor said wednesday
the man was identified later as @entity17 , @entity6 interior minister @entity15 told television broadcaster @entity19
@entity21 prosecutor @entity20 said @entity17 asked for medical help at his home in @entity21 ' 13th district sunday morning , claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon
but authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh
@entity20 said @entity17 was someone suspected of killing a 32 - year - old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger - scale terror attack in the near future
" ( @entity35 ) let them believe that he was the victim , " @entity6 president @entity34 said wednesday
" but police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated
" that probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect 's car
based on this discovery " and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual , " they looked inside the car and found a loaded @entity56 gun , a 9 - mm revolver , three cell phones , a laptop , a usb key , a satellite navigation system " and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets , " @entity20 said
a search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence , including three more kalashnikovs , three bulletproof vests , police armbands , a camera , some 2,000 euros in cash and " documents in @entity75 mentioning @entity76 and @entity77 , " according to the prosecutor
" a terrorist attack has been foiled , " @entity34 said
" it 's not the first time
" earlier @entity17 was identified as a computer science student originally from @entity82
according to @entity20 , he lived in that @entity84 country until 2001 , joined his parents in @entity6 for the next two years , then went back to @entity82
he got his undergraduate degree in that nation , then returned to @entity6 to study electronics
he 'd never been convicted of a crime ; in fact , the lone accusation against him in august 2013 was later withdrawn
but that did n't mean @entity6 authorities did n't know about @entity17
" he had been noticed wishing to go to @entity14 , " @entity20 explained
the prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat , " but he was under surveillance
" law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year , @entity15 said
the minister said the man planned to head to @entity14 , a country embroiled in a bloody , years - long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like @entity77
there was no indication he ever made it
but , @entity20 said , computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in @entity14 who " asked him to target a church
" what church ? authorities did n't disclose that detail on wednesday , though @entity20 did say " this target was confirmed by ( the suspect 's satellite navigation system ) and handwritten documents in his car
" @entity21 is home to the famed @entity122 cathedral and @entity124 basilica , both huge draws for tourists
it 's not known if either were in line to be attacked , but prime minister @entity128 wednesday visited one of the churches allegedly targeted , which was located in the @entity21 suburb of @entity132
assuming @entity17 does n't walk free anytime soon -- for now , he 's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack wo n't happen anytime soon
but authorities say he 's already claimed at least one victim
the 32 - year - old was found dead sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in @entity132 , killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder , went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat
@entity15 said @entity140 was the mother of a 5 - year - old girl and had come to the region on saturday to attend a training class
it 's not known what connection , if any , she had with the suspect
nonetheless , @entity20 said that ballistics , dna , satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of @entity140 , who @entity20 called the region 's first victim of terrorism since january
that 's when the massacre at @entity166 's offices and the siege of a kosher market in @entity21 took place , prompting @entity6 authorities to beef up security measures
" @entity6 , like other countries , is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude , " @entity128 said
" ... terrorists are targeting @entity6 to divide us
" @entity2 's @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .
