if that was a tornado , it was one monster of one
luckily , so far it looks like no one was hurt
with tornadoes touching down near @entity9 on sunday , @entity7 snapped a photo of a black cloud formation reaching down to the ground
he said it was a tornado
it would n't be an exaggeration to say it looked half a mile wide
more like a mile , said @entity18 , head of emergency management in @entity20 , @entity21
it could have been one the @entity23 warned about in a tweet as severe thunderstorms drenched the area , causing street flooding
" to repeat -- tornadoes ( yes , two ) likely @entity29 and @entity30
the one to the @entity31 is a large , damaging tornado , " the @entity23 tweeted
luckily , it tore through countryside , and there have been no reports of deaths
but surveyors had not been out to check for damage or casualties overnight because the weather was so bad , @entity18 said
there are reports of damage -- including many roofs ripped off -- in @entity44 and @entity45 , both outliers of @entity47
on social media , images circulated of flipped 18 - wheelers
tempestuous clouds created dangerous , awe - inspiring funnels and disks as a front swept through
residents reported hail the size of softballs and posted photos as proof .
