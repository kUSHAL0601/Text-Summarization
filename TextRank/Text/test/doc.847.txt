pardon us , " lost " fans , but april 8 was n't only your day
yes , we know the significance of april 8 , 2015 , and the alignment of 4:23.42 p.m. on that date to everyone obsessed with the hit @entity9 show , and we heard about the general geek - outs that were occurring
but do n't forget , april 8 was also " @entity11
" @entity12 did n't , paying homage to the 1995 film " @entity16 " and the character of @entity16 , played by the very dreamy @entity17
the movie -- also starring @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 -- centers on an independent record store in @entity24 where , on april 8 , former pop idol manning is scheduled to make an in - store appearance
fret not if you missed it , as we have some other dates made famous by films that you are n't going to want to let pass you by : april 14 their love affair was doomed like two ships passing in the night , but it was so good while it lasted for @entity35 and @entity36 in the 1997 blockbuster movie " @entity38
" the sketch @entity35 does of his beloved is dated april 14 , 1912
the @entity38 sank on april 15 , 1912
april 25 thanks to the 2000 film " @entity44 , " we now know that april 25 is the perfect date
just do n't forget to dress accordingly
october 3 " @entity51 " is officially october 3 , given that 's when @entity49 ( @entity48 , he is so hot ! ) asks @entity50 what day it is
of course , she replies " it 's october 3
" honestly , any day is a good day to quote the 2004 film
october 21 , 2015 buckle up for this one
in the 1989 film " @entity59 , " @entity56 and the gang travel to october 21 , 2015
we hope to be celebrating that in our flying car that we are still waiting on , please and thank you .
