@entity1 's ex-fiance is speaking out about their dispute over frozen embryos created while they dated
in an op - ed published by @entity7 on wednesday , @entity5 explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress
" i wanted to keep this private , but recently the story broke to the world , " @entity5 wrote
" it has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is @entity1 , who stars in the @entity19 series " @entity20 " -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life , religion and parenthood
" @entity5 says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later , at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate
after two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term , they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm
" when we create embryos for the purpose of life , should we not define them as life , rather than as property ? , " he said
" ... a woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects
should n't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects ? " @entity5 said he filed a complaint against the 42 - year - old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization
he filed it in august in @entity61 , @entity62 , where they apparently lived while they dated
" we signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties ' consent
the form did not specify -- as @entity62 law requires -- what would happen if we separated , " he said
" i am asking to have it voided
" representatives for @entity1 have declined to comment in the past
@entity5 has said he believes " life begins at fertilization " and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term
he said he does n't want any money from the egg donor
the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos
typically , a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority , said fertility specialist dr. @entity94 , who 's not involved in this case
" usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , " he said
in most cases , the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney , although anyone can make a request , @entity94 said
if there 's a disagreement , the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos , he said
@entity1 is now reportedly engaged to actor @entity115 .
