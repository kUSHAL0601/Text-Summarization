@entity0 on the @entity0 ' no - fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status , according to court documents filed by the @entity10 this week
the revised policy comes in response to a june ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the @entity18 's guarantee of due process
the decision was part of an @entity23 lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 @entity0 on the list
but the @entity23 is n't satisfied with the government 's new policy , outlined in documents filed monday in federal courts in @entity29 ( @entity30 ) and @entity31 ( @entity30 )
" after years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing , it 's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the @entity43 , " said @entity32 , director of the @entity33 and the lead attorney on the case , in a statement
" unfortunately , we 've found that the government 's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice , evidence , and a hearing
the government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed , so we 're challenging it in court again
" people on the no - fly list , managed by the @entity58 's @entity57 , are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the @entity0
the number of people on the list is classified
an official with knowledge of the government 's figures told @entity1 in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names , including about 500 @entity0
before the change , @entity0 citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no - fly list
now , they 'll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress , with an option to request further information
" the @entity0 government is making enhancements to the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) to provide additional transparency and process for @entity0 citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the @entity43 , " the @entity82 said in a statement
in cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status , the government will provide a second , more detailed response , identifying " specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the @entity43 , " according to the court documents
an unclassified summary of that information will be provided " to the extent feasible , consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake , " court papers said
those who appear on the no - fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing , with supporting materials or exhibits , and will receive a final written decision from the @entity117
the 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge .
